<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla., June 21 -- Rain and clouds forced NASA to wave off two landing opportunities for the space shuttle Atlantis Thursday afternoon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Atlantis' mission, originally scheduled for 11 days, has entered its fourteenth day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We looked at it as hard and as long as we think is reasonable,'' Cmdr. Dominic A. Antonelli, an astronaut at NASA's mission control center in Houston, told the Atlantis crew by radio at about 1:30 p.m.. ''The rain showers and the ceilings are going to keep us from making it into Florida today.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rain within 35 miles of the runway violates one of NASA's conditions for landing. Rain can damage the shuttle's delicate thermal tiles or even slow it down enough to affect its flight path. The cloud cover also dipped below 8,000 feet, violating another of NASA's landing rules.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA prefers the shuttle to land in Florida to avoid the cost and delay in transporting it back from the back-up landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Atlantis has two opportunities to land in Florida on Friday, at 2:18 p.m. and 3:54 p.m, E.D.T. However, the weather forecast remains gloomy, which makes it more likely that the shuttle will set down in California.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers decided to fire Atlantis' thrusters for a minute yesterday afternoon, speeding it up by about 11 feet per second. That nudge gives Atlantis a chance to land at Edwards during the 219th orbit, at 3:49 p.m, E.D.T. It also is lined up to land at Edwards on the two succeeding orbits, but the forecasts call for increasing winds later in the afternoon and the shuttle is not approved for landing in crosswinds that exceed 17 miles per hour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis has enough oxygen and supplies to stay in orbit until Sunday, but, barring some sort of malfunction, it will land no later than Saturday. And with concerns about Saturday's weather in both Florida and California, flight directors may take advantage of the first good opportunity Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Antonelli told Col. Frederick W. Sturckow, Atlantis' commander, ''If the weather is good at Edwards tomorrow, just like you said, and not at KSC, then we're going to land there. We are going to try to land tomorrow.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Sturckow replied, ''O.K., yep, we understand that. Thank you very much, Houston. Sounds like a great game plan.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle can also land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, an option that mission managers will consider if Atlantis is still in orbit on Saturday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, mission managers reviewed and closed three remaining issues. A piece of debris spotted floating away as Atlantis undocked Tuesday was concluded to be close to the shuttle -- and hence small and not a danger. The engineers also decided that a slight protrusion of ''gap filler'' near the leading edge of the left wing would not lead to significant heating by disrupting the airflow during reentry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A re-analysis of the possibility of damage to structure beneath a thermal blanket that came loose during launching again showed no areas of concern. To repair the blanket, mission managers extended the mission by two days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a spacewalk last Friday, one of the astronauts, John D. Olivas, tucked in the dislodged blanket and secured it with surgical staples and steel pins. Images taken by Dr. Olivas also showed no signs of damage to the underlying structure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in trying to diagnose the computer problems that bedeviled the international space station last week, Russian astronauts removed jumper cables that bypassed balky power switches on two of the computers. Without that bypass, the computers again failed to start up properly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers still do not know what caused the power switches, which act as surge protectors, to malfunction on all six computers and how the problems might be related to the attachment of a new 17.5-ton truss and new solar panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other four computers, with the jumper cable bypasses, are operating normally. The Russians also restarted the oxygen generator, which had been shut down because of the computer problems.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., June 22 -- The space shuttle Atlantis glided to a smooth landing on a desert dry lake bed here Friday, ending a two-week mission to the International Space Station that had turned somewhat dramatic after key computers broke down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were a lot of challenges on this mission, and they were all surmounted,'' said Col. Frederick W. Sturckow, the Atlantis commander,   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing at 12:49 p.m. Pacific time came after NASA had passed up four chances on Thursday and Friday to land at Kennedy Space Center in Florida because of rain and low clouds in the area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the 51st time in 118 missions that a shuttle has landed at Edwards, the last time being in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis took off on June 8 on what was to have been an 11-day mission mainly to install a new structural truss and electricity-generating solar panels on the space station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, the 21st to the station, was extended by two days so John D. Olivas could do a spacewalk to staple down a thermal blanket that had come loose during the launching. It was extended another day because of the weather in Florida.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Atlantis crew member, Clayton C. Anderson, remained at the space station with two Russian cosmonauts. He replaced Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, who returned after a six-month stay that set a record for the longest spaceflight by a woman.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is looking to share unused space aboard the International Space Station for science experiments, officials said. The agency has cut back on its own science plans for the station as it moved toward the next generation of spacecraft. Congress has called for NASA to operate the station as a national laboratory and open the door to other agencies and businesses once the orbiting facility is complete in 2010. William Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator, said that several agencies had already shown ''general interest,'' including the departments of Energy and Defense.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Peter K. Homer, an out-of-work director of a local community center in Maine, first heard that NASA was turning to America's backyard inventors to brainstorm new technologies for a possible return to the moon, he had an idea. With NASA sponsoring seven design contests for everything from a new lunar lander to a new space glove, anybody with a home-brewed invention could enter. Homer's previous jobs included some gigs in the aerospace industry as well as work sewing boat sails.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> So, Homer told me not long ago, he ruled out building a flying spacecraft but decided that ''the glove contest represented something of the scale I could achieve working out of my home by myself.'' He'd always been a garage tinkerer, he said, and being unemployed, he also wanted to prove to his 14-year-old son ''that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.'' Oh, he added offhandedly, ''the money is a motivator, too.'' At stake was a prize -- presented with one of those giant cardboard checks -- for $200,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, Homer seized his family's dining room, occupied his garage and set out to build a better space glove for NASA. It doesn't sound like the most glamorous task in the larger effort of conquering the final frontier, or maybe even that big of a problem. But the space glove is fraught with little tribulations that, like a pebble in a shoe, can drive a space program half crazy. Because the air inside a spacesuit is highly pressurized, each time an astronaut flexes a muscle, he has to overcome the suit's resistance. It's actual work. And when it comes to the highly articulated precision that is the human hand, this means that the fine sinews are quickly exhausted and the fingers brutalized by the effort. Astronauts often return from space with their hands rubbed raw, sometimes bleeding. ''In the early days,'' I was told by Alan Hayes, the C.E.O. of Volanz Aerospace Inc., the company that NASA chose to run the glove contest, ''the astronauts lost their fingernails. It was really kind of gross.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary L. Harris, a giant in the world of space gear, told me that ''flexing the hand in space is like squeezing a tennis ball.'' Harris is an industrial designer and the author of a book called ''The Origins and Technology of the Advanced Extravehicular Space Suit.'' ''There are 200-something bones in the adult body,'' he said, ''and something like 26 of them are in our hand. No mechanical device made yet can duplicate it, yet it has the weakest muscles.'' As a technological puzzle, he went on, the space glove poses all the challenges of the spacesuit, in miniature. ''The four fingers are like the four limbs,'' he said, ''and the thumb is a like a shoulder -- omnidirectional, capable of 360 degrees of motion.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, Harris showed up at the New England Air Museum, next to the Hartford, Conn., airport, where the glove contest was held. Many of the amateur designers on hand had read Harris's book for clues on glove innovation and were thrilled to meet him, until they found out he would also be competing against them. Harris had teamed with a tall, quiet Muscovite named Nik Moiseev, the man partly responsible for the cosmonauts' glove in the Russian space program. It was Moiseev's idea to partner up with Harris and win the money. ''There's no space work in Russia,'' Harris confided to me, adding that for the time being Moiseev was bunking in Harris's spare bedroom in Florida. (They joined forces with Pablo de LeA$(3$)n, the founder of a company that sells spacesuits.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after I learned that only 5 of the (rumored) 10 contestants had arrived, the assortment was, in a word, diverse. Besides Harris, the Russian and Homer, there was an art student named Ted Southern from the Pratt Institute in New York. Southern moonlights as a costume fabricator for movies and has worked recently on the outfits in Julie Taymor's coming film, ''Across the Universe.'' And those angel's wings on the Victoria's Secret models? Southern built the frames.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was an elderly Irishman with bright, blue, wary eyes who'd rather his name not become public. He spoke with an old-school Bronx accent that would make Robert De Niro cry. He wore moth-eaten clothes, practically trembled with suspicion and trailed a pitiless cloud of ammonia. He quit the contest before it even began, as did Flint Hamblin. Hamblin flew in late from Utah but then announced that his lawyers were not keen on him publicly disclosing his new novel technology, so instead he lingered, adding his own cagey aura to the mix.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paranoid or not (participating or not), this tiny subfraternity of inventors clearly loved to talk and could very quickly segue from the practical mechanics of gloves to the philosophical profundity of the human hand. They seemed long past entertaining any notion that what they were doing was inconsequential or frivolous. Sure, you might toss out a phrase like ''glove technology'' and make a childish honking noise from your nose suggesting that there was some kind of oxymoronic drift to the expression. They were just as likely to look at you oddly, wondering if you were O.K.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The writer Frank Wilson goes into this whole theory that it's not just our brains but our hands that control the way we think,'' Southern said. ''Even our grammar is built around our actions, actions taken with our hands.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homer summed up the bulk of his research thus: ''I spent a lot of time doing this.'' He held a single index finger a few inches from a fixed gaze and flexed it up and down, like a late-night stoner, real slow. Homer, who is 45, is a strikingly handsome guy -- John Edwards handsome. He speaks with the slow you-can't-get-there-from-here pace of a true Mainer, as well as with a low-talker treble so quiet you might strain across his worktable, lose your footing and crash to the floor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the space-glove conundrum, Homer told me, is a gnarly clash of basic physics. The pressurized lining of a space glove, called a bladder, strains to push out. ''Have you ever seen a doctor take a surgical glove and blow it up like a balloon with five ears?'' Homer said, explaining how a bladder works. (Each inventor tries to explain this phenomenon in his own signature way. The nearly wordless Russian pulled out a handheld international translator, typed furiously and said, ''Uhda, uhda,'' before showing me the screen, which read: UDDER. Then the Russian emitted his only laugh of the contest.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bladder wants to take the shape of a sphere,'' Homer went on, ''and that's exactly what this glove wants to do when you pressurize it.'' So an outer layer of the glove must be fashioned that confines the bladder without doing the same to the hand. Hence, the conflict. ''How do you restrain something but keep it flexible at the same time?'' Homer asked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of mechanical innovation boils down to finding just the right compromises to such puzzles. Many of us think of invention or innovation as a wholly conceived, brand-new, big-leap-forward creation unlike anything that has preceded it. But much of mechanical success involves fiddling with the inherent conflicts within a device until you find a tiny interstice among the countervailing forces, that sweet spot, where the device suddenly does what you want it to do. In the case of the glove, the sweet spot is the precise tradeoff of restraint and flexibility that will allow for maximum dexterity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the NASA contest rules, the winner of the $200,000 prize would have to outperform the NASA Phase VI glove in a series of dexterity and finger-torque tests, including the money shot of space-glove smackdowns -- the burst test, in which the glove is pumped full of water until it explodes. In the months preceding the contest, each participant wrestled the basic glove paradox to the ground, hoping to find a new compromise that would allow him to win these tests. ''I sat up one night around midnight wrapping tape around my fingers,'' Homer told me a week before the contest, ''and I had the aha! moment.'' He said he got extremely excited and shot a lot of pictures of his hand. ''Then I woke up my wife,'' he recalled, and smiled. ''She told me to come to bed.'' That's the thing about midnight discoveries. Most of the time, they don't turn out so great in the light of day. Yet not long afterward, Homer was worrying about patents. When you're an inventor, fear that your iPod-level breakthrough will be stolen is not easy to ward off.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, I asked Homer outright: What was the discovery?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'll have to come to the contest,'' he said quietly, his voice suddenly on tiptoes of suspicion, ''and find out.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in 2004 that NASA inaugurated what it calls the Centennial Challenges. The purses for the seven contests would range from the $200,000 for the glove to $2 million for the creation of a new lunar lander. Other competitions challenge contestants to invent things like a device that extracts oxygen from moon dirt; a personal air vehicle (a kind of flying car, although I'm still holding out for the jet pack of my childhood); a superstrong tether; an excavator capable of digging in the densely compacted powdery soil of the moon; and a beam-powered climber. This last one is a motorized device that pulls itself up a 200-foot-long ribbon suspended from a crane; all of the power for its motors is beamed on board from a remote source on the ground. Beam-powered technology, if perfected, would change a lot about space, allowing machines on the moon, for instance, to be recharged from a distance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's competitions arose, in part, from a desire to return to the moon, as well as to hand off part of NASA's old mission to the private sector -- that mission being to make low-orbit space travel a mere extension of planes, trains and automobiles. Of course, the competitions are also a sign of a bureaucracy trying to revive itself. From tragic shuttle explosions to diapered astronaut stalkers, NASA hasn't had a good decade since ''I Dream of Jeannie'' was canceled. Congress has appropriated for NASA a $12 million contest budget, nearly all of which -- $10.9 million -- is prize money. The competitions themselves are organized and run by private nonprofits like Volanz Aerospace. The winners retain the rights to their inventions. So if it works out as planned, everybody wins: the inventors make money, the companies get good publicity and NASA gets its technology.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this has not been easy. Even as Gary Harris and his Russian colleague were brainstorming at Harris's house in Florida, not a single one of these contests had had a winner, and NASA had not paid out its first dollar -- not an easy thing to pull off for a government bureaucracy under pressure to make a show of success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some contests have been achingly close. Last year's beam-power competition came within seconds of having a winner. And this May, a contest known as the Regolith Excavation Challenge attracted another diverse mix of entrants: two graduate students at the University of Missouri at Rolla; a guy who runs the boilers for the Detroit public schools; and a programmer for Pacific Gas and Electric named Jim Greenhaw, who wore a cap promoting an organization of his called Technology Ranch. The contest was particularly tough: you had to dig and move 330 pounds of simulated regolith (the powdery dirt that covers the moon) from a large sandbox to a scale in less than 30 minutes using only 30 watts of power -- roughly the energy needed to light one of those small bulbs in the back of refrigerator. Most of the machines failed immediately, digging into the particulate and grinding to a halt. But Greenhaw's device, a souped-up conveyor belt fitted with little scoops, managed to haul a lot of regolith. (When I asked Greenhaw where Technology Ranch was located, he smiled and pointed to his forehead. ''Right here,'' he said.) Unfortunately, Greenhaw's digger lacked sidewalls along a chute that carried the regolith, and as a result much of the dirt was pushed off the side and onto the ground. With just a few pieces of duct tape and a couple more scoops fitted to the belt, Greenhaw might well have won the $125,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the reasons Congress was telling us they weren't giving us any more money,'' Ken Davidian, the NASA administrator of the challenges, told me, ''was because we had not awarded any money.'' Davidian is a small compact man with a bit of a Dudley Do-Right chin and a swift, busy manner. At any of the contests, he can be found setting up his traveling triptych (actually five panels, a pentatych) of promotional material. ''I wasn't disappointed we weren't giving money away,'' he said, ''because we had good company, and it shows that the prizes were hard to win.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''good company'' Davidian refers to is the recent surge in prize offerings from government and private sponsors alike. Perhaps the most well known is the Ansari X Prize, which offered $10 million to the first designer to build a vehicle capable of making a round trip into suborbital space twice in two weeks. (The legendary engineer Burt Rutan won it in 2004.) The unlikely sponsor of a robot-car race started in 2004 was the Pentagon's own lab, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. In 2005, a Stanford team won that competition's $2 million purse with ''Stanley,'' an unmanned car that finished a 132-mile desert course in a first-place time of just less than seven hours. This fall, contestants in the robot-car race will compete on an urban race course. Congress is also currently considering the H-Prize Act, a bill that would provide purses of up to $10 million in six contests for breakthroughs related to hydrogen energy. All of these contests probably owe their origins to an influential 1999 report by the National Academy of Engineering, whose recommendation can be deciphered from its clunky title, ''Concerning Federally Sponsored Inducement Prizes in Engineering and Science.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans, perhaps more so than people of other nations, have great faith in the idea of the outsider inventor. The stories of inventors who made it out of their garages (Steve Jobs) and those who stayed there (Philo T. Farnsworth) are part of the national mythology. Ever since Benjamin Franklin broke with his apprenticeship in Boston as a teenager and recreated himself as a freethinker and fearless inventor (a narrative, some say, he simply repeated and wrote large with the founding of the nation), amateurism has taken on different connotations in this country. Old World use of the word ''amateur'' intimated lower-class status, even incompetency, but in America, the land of second acts, ''amateur'' has accrued some of the more positive meanings we associate with the concept of the autodidact. Americans seem drawn to the story of the outsider-made-good with an intensity that has riveted the nation from the earliest amateur contests featured regularly in Vaudeville to the latest versions of such shows, like ''American Idol.'' In America, the self-made citizen is a kind of superhero.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, when the first gas crisis hit, I remember hanging out in hours-long lines with other drivers, and one story you heard was about an always-unnamed sheik from OPEC. At some big meeting, the story went, he warned his fellow energy barons that they dare not raise gas prices too high. Why? The sheik explained that you didn't want to upset Americans too much with higher prices because they would just invent something better than oil, returning their fertile sands once again to useless desert. It was the feel-good anecdote of 1975, not unlike the earlier one told about rubber during World War II. (When supplies got cut off by the war, Americans simply invented synthetic rubber.) The veracity of these stories, like that of any good bit of folklore, hardly matters. The bigger truth is that Americans have always believed that however great the facilities might be at Bell Labs or at M.I.T., there is another place, the backyard/cellar/garage of the self-taught inventor, where sweat and commitment and zealous tinkering may lead him through one failure after another until he breaks through to an ingenious, patent-pending solution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reality behind the legend is the fact that various disciplines do indeed cycle through periods of inventiveness -- often propelled by cash prizes offered by individuals or institutions eager to nudge creativity along. The achievement of those famous bicycle repairmen, Orville and Wilbur Wright, spawned a spate of prizes in the early 20th century to spur amateurs toward various goals, like crossing the English Channel. Eventually Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean, not only to push the aviation envelope but also to beat out other competitors to win the Orteig Prize, worth $25,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For budget-conscious bureaucracies, there is another good reason to offer prizes: they're cost-effective. The total investment made by the Orteig contestants, according to Davidian, ''was 16 times the value of the purse. Combined, they spent $400,000 going after a $25,000 purse.'' A less well known aspect of Lindbergh's creativity was his charm at hornswoggling some Missouri financiers to pay for all of his research and prototyping -- St. Louis businessmen whose preening sense of risk-taking Lindbergh repaid with the immortality of the name of his rickety little plane.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA hopes to inspire similar expenditures. ''What makes prize money work is that the inventors aren't even looking at the prize as the payoff,'' Davidian said; instead, the real money is linked to the invention of a product that can be sold for greater profit at some point down the line. In fact, Davidian went on, the amount of prize money is configured according to estimates of potential downstream sales. ''The stronger that link to an after-market,'' he said, ''the smaller we can make the purse.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is banking on the idea that a renascence of technological ingenuity is just a treasure chest away. The hope is that the lure of the prize will attract another bright-faced inventor out there like Charles Lindbergh, a guy who tinkered with the tradeoffs of weight, fuel, speed and route to jigger a plane that could make it to Paris on a single tank. He so profoundly changed the public's perception of flight that international commercial air travel soon followed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plains of Missouri were as flat as ever as my flight landed in Kansas City. The next day, a Category 5 tornado just to the south sheared the town of Greensburg right off the surface of the earth, leaving a grid of rubble. Black clouds hung claustrophobically low, tumbling toward the horizon, punctuated by ground-rattling thunder. Serenely at work in his garage was Brian Turner -- by day, a computer consultant; by weekend, hopeful winner of this October's Beam-Power Challenge. Purse: $500,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I must have a few hundred years of bad luck ahead of me,'' Turner said, explaining the fate of his unique power source in last year's competition. He had gathered 135 mirrors in order to harness the sun's energy, but he broke some two dozen of them while fitting them into their wheeled, movable stands. His scheme was to keep all the mirrors pointing at the solar cells on his climber, effectively creating the equivalent of nearly 300 blazing suns as his power source. ''These were closet-door mirrors,'' he said. ''The kind you could get at Lowe's.'' Specifically, those tall narrow ones you might bolt to the back of your bathroom door. More specifically, the Lasting Reflections brand. To the surprise of the other contestants, Turner's climber sprinted up much of the 200-foot ribbon. The climber stalled only when some wind caused it to wobble and lose alignment with the light from the mirrors. No one won the contest last October, but Turner's peers were impressed enough with his showing that he became known as the proprietor of the Archimedes Death Ray -- a homage (by way of the TV show ''Mythbusters'') to the famous story about Archimedes, the Greek mathematician who was said to have focused the light off of some warriors' shields onto enemy ships and set them on fire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Turner has new designs for both his climber and his mirrors. He maintains a motley team to help him out: his mom, a former mechanic at T.W.A.; his farmer father-in-law, who welds; a phone-company worker who as a kid obsessed on solar-powered go-carts; two home-schooled teenagers around the corner who are whizzes with robotics; a programmer in California; and a guy with an alternative energy blog who joins Turner for occasional brainstorming conference calls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turner looks younger than his 38 years. He's losing his hair on top, but a pair of round spectacles highlights energetic blue eyes above the big-teeth grin of a 10-year-old boy. Like all inventors, Turner contends with the mechanical bartering at the heart of the beam climber -- weight versus stability versus speed. An entire half day in his garage on the weekend I visited was spent pondering the merits of balsa's light weight versus pine's greater strength. That morning, despite the ominous weather, much of the team had arrived and eagerly jumped to work. The conversation was chatty and fun and constant. Frustrations were easily defused with jokes, and Turner was a fount of information. ''Balsa only grows among other trees,'' he said to no one in particular. Later it would appear that balsa won this tiny garage debate based almost exclusively on its sociability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Issues sprouted up persistently all morning. The mirrors didn't quite focus properly. One motor part was stainless steel and the other was aluminum, and you can't weld those together. The solar cells on the climber couldn't touch the balsa struts or the cells might overheat. Would fiberglass scrim, strung as a tight as a drum, work? Or would the material sag over time and cause more of the fatal wobbling? These issues burbled up all morning, and Turner juggled one solution after another, constantly trying to fiddle their outcomes toward the larger goal of winning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With every problem, Turner's mind nudged the team closer to an engineer's solution. For instance, last year some of his backers became concerned that he would travel to the competition, which was held in New Mexico, only to discover that it was raining and there was no sunlight for his mirrors to reflect. ''Yeah, we would have been completely out of luck, but the competition was set up as the best of three,'' Turner explained, as the rain just outside the open doors of his two-car garage gushed into self-forming rivulets. ''I did the math on what the odds were of it being cloudy in New Mexico all three times that we ran. And the answer turned out to be less than 2 percent. So there was a 98 percent chance there would be a sun.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every detail went like this. One conference call on speakerphone concerned motor efficiency, and for two hours debates raged over the smallest riddles of volts and resistance. Sitting in a chair next to Turner, I was surprised how easy it was to tap back into that old college skill of sitting upright with an attentive pen while falling asleep. Edison said invention was 99 percent perspiration. It's not just a good line.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turner calls his team the Kansas City Space Pirates. Their insignia, which is emblazoned all over the official trailer, T-shirts and hard hats, is a Jolly Roger, except planet earth is where the skull should be, and instead of crossed cutlasses, there is a pair of interlocking sunbeams. ''Our enemy is gravity,'' Turner said. Another enemy is lack of funds. After last year's defeat, Turner did the math: If you include the several thousand dollars kicked in by various team members and his own deep investment and a few silent backers out there, the total cost of his 2006 climber, Turner estimates, was $50,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's why this year he is offering investors many promotional opportunities, hoping to revive that old spirit of St. Louis. Any corporate logo can appear on his T-shirts or on the side of his trailer -- for a fee. He has a price list that is, in Brian Turner fashion, painstakingly specific. A corporate logo on his weigh-in scale runs $500. Advertising on his hard hat is $3,000. Or you can get the Full Monty, which includes ''team-naming rights, mention during interviews, climber banner'' for $40,000. How much has he raised so far? ''We've raised enough to guarantee we're going,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, he later admitted, fund-raising has been a pretty hard slog. ''We get a lot of invitations to go fill out forms on the Web,'' he said. ''The Internet is the new brushoff.'' Hanging out with Turner, I found it hard not to wonder if his ideas and promotional schemes were loopy or brilliant. Of course, Turner himself had the same thought. ''The difference between being a mad scientist and a famous inventor is the difference between failure and success,'' he said. ''I guess I'm still in the mad-scientist phase.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Turner competed last year, the other teams who saw his mirrors thought they were the brainchild of a mad scientist, but not after he performed. At times, the teams even helped one another out. Turner wants to win, he said, but he'd like his technology to be superior and not win just because everybody else screwed up. So when another team saw Turner's impressive Archimedes Death Ray, they wanted the mirrors to supplement their high-powered Hollywood-premiere flood lamps. Turner cut a side deal on the spot for his power source: a $30,000 cut of the prize should they win. (It didn't work out.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People sometimes ask Turner if he's in all this to advance the progress of mankind. ''It's like, no, I'm here for the money,'' he said cheerfully. Turner is enamored with the thought that problems he has been puzzling over on weekends with two home-schooled teenagers might pay off. Always the detail man, Turner has made the Kansas City Space Pirates an L.L.C. (limited liability corporation) with detailed bylaws explaining how the $500,000 will be split up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mad-scientist quotient is arguably higher among beam-power enthusiasts than among contestants in the other competitions. The young teenager on the team, a long drink of water with a bowl of blond hair, is named Danny Leafblad. One night as he and I drove home from dinner at Arthur Bryant's, the famous barbecue restaurant, he let me in on a secret. For NASA, this competition is supposedly about beam power, but for the inventors, it's about building a so-called space elevator -- in theory, a 60,000-mile-tall structure that would get us into space using some of the same technology Elisha Otis tinkered with to get us up and down skyscrapers. ''NASA doesn't mention the space elevator,'' Leafblad said defensively. ''It's not on their site.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Turner's other teammates is Frank Smith, a very tall, lanky Midwesterner. Smith introduced himself as a ''liftport ambassador.'' Apparently, ''liftport'' is the proper term, the corporate euphemism -- for use among polite company, presumably more skeptical about such things -- for ''space elevator.'' ''The physics are the simple part,'' said Smith, who talks with the easy gusto of a practiced booster. ''If you take a rock and tie a string to it and spin it around, it'll stay aloft and won't hit you in the head. It will defy gravity. If you make the string longer, you can spin it slower. And if you make it long enough, you only have to spin it once a day. Know where I'm going?'' His eyes twinkle, and his head quivers ever so slightly as he sees you seeing what he is saying.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith explained that a space elevator would be a ribbon of high-strength woven carbon nanotubes six feet wide and ''as thin as Saran Wrap.'' The earth's rotation would spin this 60,000-mile-long ribbon just slow enough that it would turn with the earth and maintain a level of tautness such that you could run beam-powered climbers up and down. According to Smith, the ribbon would be anchored on a movable base located at sea on the equator about 1,000 miles west of Ecuador. Occasionally, you'd have to move the base and snap the ribbon, like a towel in a locker room, in order to move it out of the way, just briefly, of the known trajectories of space junk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As improbable as it may initially sound -- the idea originates with Arthur C. Clarke's 1979 novel ''The Fountains of Paradise'' -- the space elevator is another of those things that make the NASA competitions more interesting than what you typically expect from government initiatives. ''NASA is not interested in the space elevator per se,'' said Davidian, the NASA administrator. But he said he is happy the idea is out there if it motivates inventors. NASA's organizer for this contest, the Spaceward Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to public education about space technology, openly refers to the beam-power competition as the Space Elevator Games. The space elevator is as close as mankind might ever get to a Tower of Babel. And yes, you could ride it like an elevator, with the added benefit that the penthouse stop is one-quarter the distance to the moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's another illustration of how these contests could go either way -- is NASA engaging in pioneer thinking or flirting with a 21st-century version of alchemy? In a sense, that's a bureaucrat's question, a bean counter's nit. The inventors -- preoccupied with the minutiae of competitive forces, fund-raising, lazy teammates, conference calls, subduing physics, fugitive Home Depot clerks -- hear a question like that and think, Does it matter?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New England Air Museum is made up of several hangars joined on the sides and crammed with fabulous-looking airplanes from across the last century. Off in the corner, by a freestanding Boeing 707 cockpit, a few tourists passing by barely noticed the space-glove competition. Television has ruined competitions like this. The truth is, the contest is visually boring. The much-ballyhooed burst test involves putting the glove over a kind of mop bucket and filling the glove with water until a seam splits and starts leaking water. Sort of cool, but not much of a comparison to ''Jackass,'' ''Fear Factor'' or even a decent water-balloon fight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the moseying tempo of the whole day turned the event into a friendly kaffeeklatsch of engineers who go about the tedious paces of their measurements, as well as the aspiring inventors who, after a while, shed their suspicions and seem happy to trade insights and even some secrets. In the wonderful geeky excitement of the morning, the moments were there. Right away, the three contestants became two: Southern's glove was put over the mop bucket and sprang a leak before it could even qualify. The combat was suddenly the stuff of myth: the Goliaths of Harris and Moiseev versus an unemployed David named Homer. Both teams passed the burst test and the dexterity test. It all rode on the torque measurements of each finger joint, and there was talk that the NASA glove had already been surpassed, suggesting that this afternoon, NASA would have its first Centennial Challenges winner.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Problem solving and invention are greatly simplified when you're asking the right question,'' Homer said from his worktable, ''so the problem that I determined needed solving is how to constrain something while at the same time allow it to move.'' Ready to reveal his eureka moment, he motioned to his glove. Over the space between each knuckle of the fingers, restraint material was stitched in the shape of an X. ''What I did was take strips of painter's tape and wrapped them around my fingers,'' he went on. ''And I figured out that when you put tape around your fingers you can't move your hand.'' Then, at a moment past midnight, Homer stopped running the tape up and down his fingers, or spiraling it around each finger, or any other configuration that seemed obvious. Instead he cross-stitched it between the knuckles and found that when he held his fingers in front of eyes and flexed them, the tape neither buckled nor broke.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you have the tape on tight across the top, you can't bend your finger,'' Homer said. ''This pattern of X is actually a longer line on your finger but the line doesn't get any longer or shorter when you flex.'' The painter's tape just stayed where it was, it held its place. ''I could just bend my finger and make a fist and then make it wide open and I couldn't even feel the tape,'' he said. ''It was like it wasn't even there.'' When he tested this design on a glove, he noticed an added benefit -- that the knuckles easily buckled at just the right places, making it even easier to flex the hand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Davidian, the NASA official, had set up his pentatych of promotional material, and there was the cardboard check. The three judges spent most of the day in quiet consideration, occasionally consulting a clipboard. Harris couldn't help waxing historic on the subject of gloves. He talked to a small, attentive audience about how some of the great spacesuit companies represented at the competition got their start in other, related fields. I.L.C. Dover was originally the International Latex Corporation and the makers of the Playtex glove. ''And David Clark Company Inc. came out of brassiere manufacturing,'' Harris said seriously. ''They invented various kinds of bras, and then they got into the pressurized suits. They were in the 'containing garment' business.'' The three of us listening all went ''huh'' at the same time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harris talked about how much of what might have been known about glove technology is lost because all the guys in the early days who improvised their own way to various gloves worn by astronauts never wrote anything down and were fired or retired long ago. And on the Russian side? ''The Russian designers are mostly all dead -- Sharipov, Stoklitsky, Abramov,'' he said, as if their names were as familiar as Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins. He noted that even though Severin did write a book, it's in Russian. ''The Air Force has a translation of it,'' he said, ''but it's a computer translation, and so for 'sleeve' it might say 'pipe.' It's a mess.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of his space-glove know-how, Homer said: ''I had to make it up, because there is no book you can buy about this. There is no pattern.'' He added that his past job sewing boat sails helped him the most because everything about gloves comes down to how they are pieced together. A great deal of the space-age glove innovation, Harris and Homer agree, ultimately rests on prehistoric arts. ''Sewing is a primitive technology,'' Harris said. ''It was started some 15,000 years ago when some guy took a bone and pulled a strand of a horse's tail to sew up some skins to keep warm, and here we are using this ancient technology. While this work may be slightly better, it's no quantum leap over previous technology.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the day, Alan Hayes of Volanz Aerospace, the competition's organizer, stood holding the cardboard check. The judges had done their myriad gauge tests and punctiliously recorded, added and averaged the scores. The microphone was passed around to a number of NASA and contest dignitaries, who said kind words about innovation and dealt out thanks promiscuously. ''And now the moment you've all been waiting for,'' Hayes said to a collection of folks slumped, mostly, in three rows of five chairs quickly lined up for the occasion. ''We had three fantastic competitors,'' he continued. Some shuffling among the chairs. ''And before we even give the award, everybody provided something important, and we all learned something.'' There was a herdlike movement among the chairs, possibly expressing a sense of suspense, although maybe it was annoyance. ''One team did win,'' Hayes said finally, ''and I'm proud to say the winner is Peter Homer.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a scattering of applause, and Homer sidled up to take the big check. From the front row of the few chairs, the Russian was confused by his limited language skills, although he did manage to bellow, ''We not win, no?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the rest of the crowd, the feelings were the same -- actual amazement that anyone could have beat the best of American and Russian glove experience. Yet it's clear that Homer's glove had thrilled the NASA experts present. In exchange for the large cardboard check, the test glove would be flown to Houston and examined by staff experts. Homer's cross-stitched method had actually accomplished something new by discovering a better balance in the tradeoff of competing forces. He had inched glove technology just that little farther distance along -- a real-world achievement, known to the U.S. Patent Office as ''Glove Reinforcement With Reduced Restriction of Movement,'' or Patent Application No. 60/915,444.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>987 words</div><div>3 July 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the fallout from the ''Is-Pluto-a-planet?'' debate is that the asteroid Ceres is no longer just a rock among hundreds of thousands of rocks in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceres is now also a dwarf planet. At almost 590 miles wide, it is big enough that its gravity has made it round, but not big enough to be considered a planet. Like Pluto, it fails part of the planet definition passed by the International Astronomical Union: it has not ''cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceres's new celebrity on the solar system B-list will perhaps bring more prominence to NASA's Dawn spacecraft, scheduled to be launched on Saturday atop a Delta II rocket. The spacecraft is to visit Vesta, the third largest asteroid, in October 2011, and depart in April 2012 to Ceres It would arrive at Ceres in February 2015.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ceres was discovered on Jan. 1, 1801, it was declared a bona fide planet, because it filled a gap where astronomers had expected a planet. But then astronomers discovered another apparently planetary body, and another, and another. Eventually, they decided to reclassify all of these as asteroids, Ceres included.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent times, asteroids have not attracted much attention except for when one has veered into an orbit that looks like it might slam into Earth. Otherwise, asteroids are typically regarded as the slacker detritus of the solar system, leftover bits that did not show enough initiative to get together to form a real planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For planetary astronomers like Christopher T. Russell, a professor of geophysics and space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is Dawn's principal investigator, that is precisely why he wants a closer look, to see the protoplanet pieces before they came together into a rocky planet like Earth, Mars or Venus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're interested in is what our ancestors were like,'' Dr. Russell said ''We're interested in what these early bodies did and how they evolved because those are the building blocks basically of the Earth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroids turn out to be a fairly diverse bunch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vesta, irregularly shaped and 330 miles wide, is bone-dry rock with an inner core of iron. That composition may be the result of Vesta forming earlier; greater amounts of radioactive elements generated hotter temperatures, which evaporated the water away and melted the rocks, allowing the iron to migrate to the center. People on Earth have already seen lots of pieces of Vesta; about one-in-twenty of the meteorites that have been found on Earth carry a chemical signature that indicates they came from Vesta.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, under Ceres' outer coating of dust the asteroid appears to have a thick layer of ice, perhaps 60 miles deep, wrapped around a ball of rock. But there is no iron core. It is still by far the largest asteroid, with about a third of all of the mass in the asteroid belt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn's instruments include a camera and two spectrometers that can detect the presence of elements and different minerals. One target of interest is a 285-mile-wide crater in the southern hemisphere of Vesta, where the scientists hope to see if the mix of minerals is different underground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to use the craters as a probe to drill in the objects,'' Dr. Russell said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the Hubble Space Telescope took a series of pictures of Vesta to map out the southern hemisphere, showing areas of different brightness and color, which may hint at regions of ancient volcanic eruptions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first, the spacecraft needs to get off the launching pad. Some last-minute glitches delayed the take-off date from June 20 to July 7. But if there are any more delays, NASA might have to pull the Dawn off the launching pad to make room for the Mars Phoenix probe, which must launch by Aug. 25 or Mars and Earth will be out of alignment for two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA team meets today to decide whether to continue preparations for a Saturday launching of Dawn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn has its own time and cost constraints. Taking it off the launching pad could cost NASA up to $25 million. And after November, Ceres and Vesta move too far apart so that Dawn would never be able to get from Vesta to Ceres, Dr. Russell said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, the Dawn mission has already followed an arduous path. Dr. Russell had been proposing variations of an asteroid mission since 1994. His first proposal was to send a spacecraft to the Moon and then to Vesta. But then NASA chose to pursue the Lunar Prospector mission and he figured one moon mission was enough for the space agency. All those delays had a silver lining when he realized that Vesta and Ceres came close enough so that one mission could visit both. Dawn was approved in 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project hit some technological snags, in part because of the newfangled ion engine it uses. Unlike chemical rockets that fire for short amounts of time, an ion engine, which shoots out a jet of charged atoms, delivers very low thrust but fires continuously.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the delays and cost overruns, NASA canceled the mission last year. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which built the spacecraft, appealed the decision, and Michael D. Griffin, NASA's administrator, revived it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got two years behind schedule,'' Dr. Russell said. ''We're just going to make it. Fortunately, that opportunity to go to both of the asteroids was large enough that even NASA didn't slip us out of that opportunity.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars rovers keep going, so NASA keeps finding new places for them to go.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometime soon, the rover Opportunity is to go over the edge into the half-mile-wide Victoria Crater in search of new hints about Mars's ancient, and possibly wet, past. For the past nine months, Opportunity has been driving around the crater rim. That reconnaissance has identified a location where the tilt is relatively shallow, up to about 20 degrees, a favorable spot for the rover to enter -- and, mission managers hope, eventually exit -- the crater.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover has driven up and down even steeper slopes of solid rock, but if it drives into sand or suffers a mechanical failure, it could be trapped forever.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't guarantee, although we think we are likely to come back out of the crater,'' said S. Alan Stern, the associate director for NASA's science mission directorate, who approved the decision to enter the crater last week. ''We know the rewards are worth the risk.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dust storm swirling in the region worsened this weekend. That will likely delay the move into the crater, which could have been as early as Saturday .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're probably going to wait a little while to wait out the dust storm,'' John L. Callas, the mission's project manager, said yesterday. Because of the darkening skies, the amount of energy generated by Opportunity's solar panels has dropped by almost half since last week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial entry will just be a ''a toe dip'' to make sure the rover does not encounter any difficulties, Dr. Callas said. If that goes well, it will proceed farther into the 200-foot-deep crater.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are particularly interested in a band of bright rocks that looks like a bathtub ring circling the crater about 10 feet below the rim.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is somehow different from everything else around it,'' said Steven W. Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell and the mission's principal investigator. ''That was the original pre-impact surface. This bright stuff is the stuff that was in contact with the Martian atmosphere at the time Victoria Crater formed, which may have been billions of years ago.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocks may thus preserve some chemical signature of Mars's ancient climate. Opportunity and its twin, Spirit, have both found ample evidence of liquid water in Mars's past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be the third crater that Opportunity will be rolling around in. By chance, Opportunity tumbled into a 65-foot-wide crater when it landed in January 2004. It then visited a stadium-size crater called Endurance before driving almost six miles to Victoria, which is six times as wide as Endurance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because sedimentary rocks build up over time, the deeper depth of Victoria may enable Opportunity to explore farther back in Mars's geological history.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel of scientists convened by the country's leading scientific advisory group says the hunt for extraterrestrial life should be greatly expanded to include what they call ''weird life'': organisms that lack DNA or other molecules found in life as we know it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The committee's investigation makes clear that life is possible in forms different from those on Earth,'' the scientists conclude in their report, ''The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems,'' published yesterday by the National Research Council.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other experts hailed the report as an important rethinking of the search for life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to help us a lot to make sure we go exploring with our eyes wide open,'' said Michael A. Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starfish, sequoias, salamanders and the rest of Earth's residents may seem very diverse, but they are surprisingly similar on the molecular scale. All species that scientists have studied need liquid water to survive, for example. Further, they all rely on DNA to carry genetic information, and they all use that information to build proteins from the same set of building blocks, known as amino acids.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has long looked to life on Earth to guide its search for life in other worlds. Planets and moons that have hints of liquid water have been ranked high on the list of potential sites for life-detection missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is good reason to suspect that other kinds of chemistry could support life as well, the authors of the new report argue. Weird life could differ from life as we know it in small or big ways.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, while DNA uses phosphorus in its backbone, it might be possible to build a backbone out of arsenic instead. And life might exist in liquids other than water, perhaps ammonia or methane.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which is posted on the Web site of the National Academies,   www.nationalacademies.org  [http://www.nationalacademies.org], even explores the possibility of life based on silicon, not carbon, though Dr. Meyer, who had no role in the work, thinks that astrobiologists should limit their search to carbon-based life forms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we look in the universe,'' he said, ''the only compounds we see with more than six atoms are all carbon chemistry. So there's a hint that looking for carbon chemistry may be a better bet. There we have some idea of what to look for.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report calls for NASA and the National Science Foundation both to support research into weird life. Chemists need to investigate ''the chemical possibilities for what forms life might take,'' said one member of the committee, Steven A. Benner, a distinguished fellow at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, in Gainesville, Fla.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists should also search Earth for weird life, the authors maintain. ''There's much about Earth life we don't understand,'' said the panel's chairman, John A. Baross of the University of Washington.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Benner said there was ''good evidence that the life we know on Earth was preceded by a weird form of life.'' Early Earth life may have been based on RNA, a single-stranded form of DNA. Though DNA-based life may have outcompeted earlier forms on the surface of the planet, RNA life may still exist in refuges. One potential hiding place is deep below the ocean floor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an incredibly primordial world down there,'' Dr. Baross said. ''If you're going to look for remnants of an RNA world, those are the environments you want to go to.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find weird life, however, scientists will have to build new kinds of detectors. ''There's no question that the surveys of life on the planet we've done so far would have missed it,'' Dr. Benner said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists also said the possibility of weird life should prompt NASA to reorder its future missions. They singled out Saturn's moon Titan as particularly promising. The Huygens probe that visited Titan in 2005 found evidence of liquid methane raining down on its surface, as well as a mix of water and ammonia seeping up from its interior. Both could conceivably support life, although not necessarily life as we know it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing,'' the report concluded, ''would be more tragic in the American exploration of space than to encounter alien life and fail to recognize it.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned weekend launching of a spacecraft to explore two of the solar system's largest asteroids was delayed again because of problems with a tracking ship and aircraft. NASA set Monday afternoon as a new launching time for the Dawn spacecraft, which will embark on a journey of many years to the asteroids Vesta and Ceres, which lie between Mars and Jupiter. The spacecraft had originally been set to launch Saturday, but that was ruled out because thunderstorms and lightning at the launching pad prevented loading its fuel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Dawn spacecraft, originally scheduled to head into space this past Saturday on a mission to visit two large asteroids, will now be launched in September. Bad weather and problems with an aircraft and a ship needed to observe the launching first prompted NASA on Friday to push back the launching date by a week, to July 15. On Saturday, NASA decided on the longer postponement, worrying that further delays could complicate the launching of the Mars Phoenix lander, which must get off the ground by Aug. 25, before Earth and Mars move out of alignment for two years. The delay in launching the Dawn craft will add $20 million to $25 million to the mission's $446 million cost, but will not affect its science goals in visiting the asteroids Vesta and Ceres.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY   </div><div>543 words</div><div>10 July 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 9 -- The next spacecraft heading for Mars, a lander cobbled together from unused parts of other craft, is to examine the previously unvisited arctic region of the planet that appears to have water ice beneath the surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said Monday that they were ready to send Phoenix Mars Lander to the northern region of the Red Planet. Plans call for launching the craft from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a Delta II rocket during a three-week window that opens on Aug. 3.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After taking almost 10 months to reach Mars, the spacecraft is to make a fiery entry into the atmosphere before being slowed by a parachute and eventually landing with the help of a series of pulsing retro rockets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Phoenix is going to a completely new area,'' Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona, the mission's principal scientist, said during a news briefing at NASA headquarters. Past spacecraft landing on Mars have visited the central or equatorial areas of the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll be in the northern arctic region, in the permafrost area, where we think there is water in the form of ice mixed with soil beneath the surface,'' Mr. Smith said later.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the roving craft last sent to Mars, the Phoenix Lander will drop in one place and stay there. With an eight-foot-long arm that operates like a backhoe, the robot craft is to dig a series of trenches more than 20 inches into the ground and retrieve samples for analysis by instruments it carries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter found evidence in 2002 to support theories that large areas of Mars, including the arctic plains, have water ice. Mr. Smith said Phoenix is to spend more than three months looking at the composition and chemistry of the soil samples to see what happens when the ice melts. This is to see whether frozen water near the Martian surface might periodically melt enough to sustain a livable environment for microbes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the spacecraft will serve as a Martian weather station, following changes in the polar region to help scientists build a model of the planet's weather. The craft is equipped with a laser for assessing water and dust in the atmosphere. The spacecraft, which runs 18 feet wide and 5 feet long with twin solar power panels extended, includes a stereo camera to survey the landing site, a descent camera to see the site in broader context before landing and two microscopes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix Lander is the first mission in NASA's new Mars Scout Program of relatively low-cost missions to the planet to supplement billion-dollar ''flagship'' projects to study the planet. Phoenix draws its name from the mythical bird that rose from its ashes, because the craft is made up of parts of two earlier attempts to explore Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft is made of the supporting structure and some instruments from the 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, which never flew, and several instruments from the unsuccessful Mars Polar Lander in 1999.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A brief article on Thursday about the possibility of water on another planet referred imprecisely to the star that the planet orbits. The star is about three million miles away from the planet, known as HD 189733b -- not from Earth.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have found what they say is the best evidence yet for water, or at least steam, in the atmosphere of a planet around another star, but it's a sure bet there is no one there to drink it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as HD 189733b, is slightly larger than Jupiter and orbits a star about three million miles away in the constellation Vulpecula. Earlier this year, the Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet's temperature at 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit and suggested it was bone dry, to the consternation of theorists who say water should be fundamental in planet formation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a team, which also used the Spitzer telescope, has re-examined the planet as it passed in front of its star. The earlier observations had been made when the planet passed behind its star.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new arrangement, starlight passing through the planet's atmosphere was absorbed at infrared wavelengths characteristic of water, suggesting that there is water on the planet if you know how to look for it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team, led by Giovanna Tinetti of the European Space Agency and University College, London, reported its work today in Nature.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars rover Opportunity, caught in a swirling dust storm, has been told to not even bother calling home until Monday in order to save energy, the agency said. It is the first time in the three-and-a-half-year mission that the rover, which runs on energy generated by its solar panels, has needed such drastic energy conservation measures. Dust is blocking 99 percent of the direct sunlight above Opportunity, and the storm is so large that it is also affecting Spirit, another rover on the other side of the planet. Opportunity was to have begun exploration of a half-mile crater this month, but that has been put off until the skies clear.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A giant dust storm enveloping NASA's Mars rover Opportunity appears to have eased slightly over the weekend, allowing the rover to recharge its batteries a little. But the storm continues, blocking out 99 percent of the direct sunlight. Since last Wednesday, the rover's power use has been trimmed to the minimum. It will continue to sit in place and not even communicate again with controllers until Thursday. The other Mars rover, Spirit, has been affected by the same storm, although not as seriously. It, too, is sitting in place until the skies clear, but continues normal communications.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacewalking astronaut, Clayton C. Anderson, discarded a camera mounting and an ammonia tank weighing more than half a ton at the International Space Station. The outdated equipment was no longer needed and joined more than 9,000 pieces of orbital debris already being tracked from Earth. NASA normally tries to avoid adding to the debris, but officials said they felt they had no choice in this case. The equipment had to be removed, and because of a looming 2010 deadline for ending all shuttle flights, the space agency does not have room on its remaining missions to return the tank to Earth.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has lost $94 million in office equipment over the past decade, looking the other way as employees give computers to spouses or claim missing laptops are lost in space, according to a Congressional report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These problems are deeply rooted in an agency culture that does not demand accountability,'' the Government Accountability Office said in a report released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration noted the problem five years ago in its own study. Instead of tightening controls, it relaxed them, making $10,000 the minimum value for trackable items, instead of $5,000, the report said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report recommended 10 steps, including disciplining negligent employees and toughening oversight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one instance documented by the accountability office, an unidentified worker explained the fate of a missing laptop, worth $4,265:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This computer, although assigned to me, was being used on board the International Space Station. I was informed that it was tossed overboard to be burned up in the atmosphere when it failed.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's astronauts have flown while intoxicated on at least two occasions, according to reports of an internal NASA investigation, and the astronauts involved were warned that their drunkenness constituted a safety risk to the flight. But it is unclear whether this is a current problem and whether the incidents involved space shuttle flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which has not been released, was described in an article published yesterday on the Web site of Aviation Week and Space Technology. According to the article, the panel investigators reported '' 'heavy use of alcohol' by astronauts'' within 12 hours of flying.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to people who have seen the report, it is a 12-page document with a single paragraph that deals with the accusations of alcohol and flying. It gives no details or specifics on the astronauts or the circumstances surrounding the incidents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it would hold a news conference about the report today. Yesterday, NASA officials were asked about it at a news conference about the next shuttle mission, that of the Endeavour, which is scheduled to lift off as early as Aug. 7.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Gerstenmaier, the head of space operations for NASA, declined to discuss the report before its release, but said, ''I've never had any instances'' involving safety risks because of drunken astronauts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's not been a disciplinary action or anything I've been involved with regarding this type of activity,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A veteran astronaut, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment, said he had seen no evidence of alcohol problems or heavy use of alcohol before shuttle missions. ''As with any group of people, some people drink and some don't on social occasions,'' he said of the astronaut corps.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also raised questions about the timing of the alleged drinking.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wonder how someone could get into trouble right before a launch because of the way they keep us bottled up right before a flight,'' he said. ''We've got a lot of preflight requirements, including a sleep period and examinations before breakfast and suiting up before heading to the pad. There's lot to do and a lot of people watching you.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, ordered the report after the February arrest of an astronaut, Capt. Lisa Marie Nowak of the Navy, who confronted a romantic rival in the parking lot of Orlando International Airport. Captain Nowak has since been fired by NASA and will be tried in Florida on charges of assault and attempted kidnapping.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin asked the panel to evaluate the medical and psychological screening astronauts receive to determine if there were problem areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Gerstenmaier also acknowledged that a worker at a space agency subcontractor had deliberately cut wires in equipment headed for the International Space Station. The sabotage was discovered before the device was loaded onto the shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The device, which is being repaired, is not critical to the space station, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, so even if the damage had not been detected, it would not have posed a danger. The incident is under investigation, he said.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 27 -- NASA is investigating reports that some astronauts may have flown while drunk, and will develop a formal code of conduct for the astronaut corps, officials of the agency said Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Congressional committees already promising hearings on alcohol use and other health issues, the officials said they had asked NASA's safety chief, Bryan D. O'Connor, to interview astronauts, flight surgeons and others to determine whether the agency had an alcohol problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has come under embarrassing scrutiny since the allegations were made public on Thursday, in a report by the magazine Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology about the findings of an independent eight-member panel looking into astronaut health issues. The panel, of medical, legal and psychiatric experts, interviewed 14 astronauts, 5 of their family members and 8 flight surgeons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the panel released some details of the drinking allegations, but emphasized that they were anecdotal and had not been corroborated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one incident, an astronaut was said to have been impaired by alcohol before a planned shuttle liftoff that was delayed by mechanical problems. Afterward, when crew members wanted to fly their T-38 training jets from Florida back home to Houston, a colleague questioned the same astronaut's ability to fly, said the panel's chairman, Col. Richard E. Bachmann Jr., a physician who commands the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another account, an astronaut flying to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft became drunk before the trip.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No names or dates were given for either incident.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee's review of physical and psychological health issues affecting astronauts stemmed from the arrest of an astronaut, Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, a naval officer, after she confronted a romantic rival last February in the parking lot at Orlando International Airport. Captain Nowak was subsequently discharged from NASA and faces charges of assault and attempted kidnapping.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference here Friday, the panel's chairman, Colonel Bachmann, said via telephone hookup that the reason the anecdotal references to the drinking incidents were included in the report that the panel delivered to NASA was not to suggest that the agency necessarily had an alcohol problem, but to emphasize the importance of heeding flight surgeons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel did not ask for details of the accounts, including reports of heavy alcohol use by astronauts immediately before flights, and does not know how any such episodes were resolved, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In none of these can we say factually they did or did not occur,'' he continued, adding that the panel's mission had been not to investigate allegations but to point out that health and safety concerns might have been ignored.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jonathan Clark, a former NASA and military flight surgeon whose wife, Laurel Salton Clark, died in the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, said he was surprised at the lack of factual substantiation in the report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to put something in like that,'' Dr. Clark said, referring to the allegations of heavy drinking before fights, ''you've got to make sure you've got your facts straight.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if an astronaut did actually board and fly a T-38 jet while intoxicated, ''that's a big deal,'' he said, reflecting a ''blatant disregard for safety.'' That in turn would hark back to the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and the presidential commission that investigated the earlier Challenger explosion. Both concluded that a culture of playing down safety issues had had a part in the disasters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sandra A. Yerkes, a retired Navy captain and flight surgeon who was a member of the astronaut health panel, said she and her colleagues had been concerned that the alcohol allegations might be sensationalized.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought we had couched it properly,'' she said of the references to drinking, which involved five paragraphs of the panel's 12-page report. ''Perhaps it was naive of the committee to put it in there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the report, NASA officials said astronauts would be asked to draft a code of conduct to detail what behavior was expected from members of the agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Ochoa, director of flight crew operations at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said NASA policy had long prohibited drinking in the 12 hours before an astronaut flies a training jet -- the so-called ''12-hour bottle-to-throttle rule.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This policy has also unofficially applied to spaceflights, she said, but from now on will formally apply.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a NASA report suggested that some astronauts may have flown while intoxicated, a furor erupted, and NASA 's alcohol rules -- or lack of them -- came to light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules regarding alcohol and astronauts are somewhat vague, NASA officials said Friday at a news conference. Its alcohol rules for space flight have historically been the rules it applies to the use of its aircraft, informally carried over into the realm of space flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the new report, NASA announced an interim alcohol policy based on rules for the T-38 training jets that astronauts enjoy the free use of. Those rules call for no alcohol consumption within 12 hours of a flight, and ''astronauts will neither be under the influence nor the effects of alcohol at the time of launch.'' NASA officials said at the news conference that during the quarantine period of about a week before a flight, alcoholic beverages were available at crew quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also said that the schedule the day before a launch was very busy, and that the astronauts were in close contact with medical personnel, so that it was hard to understand how such incidents could occur unnoticed. There's no indication in the new report as to when the alleged incidents occurred: In the last couple of years, in the changed safety climate after the Columbia accident? Before Columbia? Before Challenger? So it's impossible to know the severity of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a long tradition of two-fisted hard living among military pilots. Tom Wolfe wrote in ''The Right Stuff'' about Chuck Yeager having a few drinks at the Muroc hangout, Pancho's, two nights before breaking the sound barrier and going riding horses with his wife and having an accident that broke two ribs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yeager didn't go to Pancho's and knock back a few because two days later the big test was coming up,'' Mr. Wolfe wrote. ''Nor did he knock back a few because it was the weekend. No, he knocked back a few because night had come and he was a pilot at Muroc. In keeping with the military tradition of Flying &amp; Drinking, that's what you did, for no other reason than that the sun had gone down. ...''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traffic in space is getting so congested that flight controllers in the past few weeks have had to nudge three spacecraft out of harm's way, in one case to prevent the craft from colliding with its own trash.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 23, controllers in Houston raised the orbit of the International Space Station by roughly five miles to avoid hitting a half-ton tank of ammonia that a spacewalking astronaut had tossed out earlier in the day while doing some housecleaning on the $100 billion outpost.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't normally dump something like this,'' said Lynette Madison, a spokeswoman at the Johnson Space Center. But, she added, the space shuttle had no room in its schedule for returning the refrigerator-size tank to Earth. Officials expect the container to orbit the Earth for nearly a year before making a fiery re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another episode took place on July 4, as the nation relaxed for the holiday. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., fired up the engines on NASA's CloudSat, a $217 million environmental satellite that peers inside cloud formations with a powerful radar, to dodge a mini satellite launched by Iran in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl L. Yuhas, head of earth science missions at the Washington headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the maneuver put more than two miles between the two spacecraft, preventing a potential crackup.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials and private space experts say episodes like these illustrate the danger of a drastic rise in satellites and space debris in Earth's orbit. Early this year, after decades of growth, the federal catalog of detectable objects (four inches wide or larger) orbiting Earth reached 10,000, including dead satellites, old rocket engines and junkyards of whirling debris left over from chance explosions and weapon tests.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, that number has jumped to 12,000. China's test of an antisatellite weapon in January and four spacecraft breakups in February, one of them mysterious, have contributed to the buildup of debris. Space officials worry that a speeding bit of space junk could shatter an object into dozens or hundreds of fragments, starting a chain reaction of destruction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts said that moving spacecraft out of the way to avoid collisions, once a rare way of dealing with potential threats, is becoming increasingly common.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 22, nearly two weeks before the CloudSat maneuver, ground controllers at Goddard nudged NASA's Terra, an environmental satellite, out of harm's way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American space experts had calculated that debris from China's antisatellite test might hit the $1.3 billion spacecraft, which can gauge environmental health by measuring changes in the greenness of the planet's surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a close call,'' said Lauri Newman, a flight engineer at Goddard who assesses collision threats. ''But we have a process in place that obviously worked.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the debris came no closer than a half mile to the Terra.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese weapon test, on Jan. 11, shattered an aging weather satellite into hundreds of bits, in what space experts describe as the worst satellite fracture of the space age.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after that, four more breakups added to the debris problem: On Feb. 2, a new Chinese navigation satellite suffered an apparent engine failure that left it in dozens and perhaps hundreds of pieces. On Feb. 14, an abandoned Russian engine broke into roughly 60 detectable pieces, apparently because residual fuel had exploded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 18, a retired spacecraft jointly developed by China and Brazil suddenly and mysteriously broke into dozens of pieces. American experts suspect it was the victim of a collision with other space debris.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then on Feb. 19, a large Russian space tug exploded, apparently from residual fuel, creating a cloud of about 1,000 pieces of detectable debris.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbital Debris Quarterly News, a NASA publication, noted that at least three of the four breakups appeared to have been preventable if more caution had been exercised in designing and operating the vehicles.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 30 -- NASA is about to launch a scientific laboratory to Mars that will be the first spacecraft to land in the northern polar region of the planet and dig for evidence of water or other conditions that could support some form of life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, Mars Phoenix Lander, is set to launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a Delta II rocket during a three-week window that opens Friday. If the 770-pound lander touches down safely after its 10-month journey, it will spend three months or longer probing the ground and monitoring the weather above.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike rover missions that explore large areas, Phoenix is to stay on one spot in the permafrost region of the Martian arctic and use a mechanical arm to explore the area in detail. ''This is a vertical mission,'' said Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona, the mission's principal scientist. ''We are going to dig down and not explore horizontally.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target area rests at latitudes equivalent on Earth to Northern Alaska, Siberia or Greenland, Mr. Smith said. It is covered with polar ice in the winter, but Phoenix is to arrive in the summer when the ground is mostly clear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After landing, the robot spacecraft will unfurl a pair of circular solar power arrays that give it a width of 18 feet. It will deploy a pair of stereoscopic color cameras on a mast that extends 7 feet above the surface to record panoramic views, and extend a 4-foot mast bearing temperature sensors from an onboard weather station supplied by the Canadian Space Agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather station, designed to operate even after the craft's primary digging mission is completed, is to track daily and seasonal changes in temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind speed and direction. In addition, a pulsing laser will fire into the atmosphere to measure the size and altitude of dust and ice particles in the vicinity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a 7.7-foot-long hinged arm that operates like a backhoe, the craft is to dig a series of trenches more than 20 inches into the ground with a movable metal scoop that has sharp prongs and serrated blades on the end. At full range, the arm can reach eight square yards of surface area near the lander, Mr. Smith said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guided by a camera on the end of the scoop, scientists will select soil and ice samples for detailed study by instruments on the lander. For one experiment, the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer, samples will be dropped into a hopper to feed eight single-use ovens the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. The sample will be slowly heated to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit to study the transition from solid to liquid to gas, and the vapors analyzed by a mass spectrometer to measure the mass and composition of specific molecules.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four other samples are to be examined in a miniature wet chemistry laboratory, where they will be stirred into a prewarmed solution and mixed with chemicals to tease out certain constituents, such as carbonates, sulfates and soil oxidants. Such components could either encourage or deter the formation of life if liquid water were available at times, scientists said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This laboratory also contains two microscopes to examine the fine structure of soil and ice samples, revealing features as small as 1/1,000th the width of a human hair that could be evidence of past liquid water on the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix draws its name from the mythical bird that rose from its ashes because it is made of parts of two earlier efforts to explore Mars. ''It's really getting a second chance, as its name implies,'' said Douglas McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA. ''It is mainly refurbished hardware.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft is made of the supporting structure and some instruments from the 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, which never flew because of cost overruns, and several backup instruments from the unsuccessful Mars Polar Lander in 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCuistion estimated the project would cost $420 million, including $90 million for the launch rocket. He said the amount was $25 million to $30 million above initial estimates because the program decided to do more tests and simulations to help assure mission success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent spacecraft like the rovers Spirit and Opportunity have landed on Mars encased in airbags to cushion their fall and bounce around obstacles. Phoenix Lander is too heavy for the airbag approach so it will make a fiery entry into Mars's atmosphere protected by a heat shield before being slowed by a parachute and eventually making a soft landing with the help of pulsing retro rockets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCuistion noted that the success rate for landing spacecraft on Mars was under 50 percent, and that there was added risk in attempting a soft landing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Phoenix is to operate during the Martian summer, scientists hope the spacecraft survives dwindling sunlight and power to see approaching winter cover the area with ice. ''I'd be thrilled if we could last long enough to see ice form around the spacecraft,'' Mr. Smith said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing: ''A Laboratory on Mars'' The Phoenix lander has a robotic arm designed to dig and scrape samples of Martian soil for analysis on the lander. One on-board instrument is the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer, a set of eight single-use ovens. A sample of soil and ice dropped into an open bay falls through a screen into a tiny compartment, which is then gradually heated to 1,800 degrees. A calorimeter measures the melting and boiling points of the soil components, and released gases are sent to a mass spectrometer for identification.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Aug. 4 -- NASA launched a Mars lander on Saturday, beginning a 422-million-mile journey scheduled to culminate next spring in the first landing within the planet's Arctic Circle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unmanned Delta rocket bearing the craft blasted off on time before dawn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the blastoff, engineers inside launching control worried as they awaited contact with the spacecraft. Charles P. Dovale, the launching director, finally confirmed success, one and a half hours into the flight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything appears normal, but it was a little bit of anxious moments there,'' Mr. Dovale said. ''It seemed like an eternity but it was about 20 minutes or so where we weren't sure.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 5 of the world's 15 attempts to land on Mars have succeeded. If this one goes as planned, the spacecraft will set down on the Martian Arctic plains on May 25, 2008, and spend three months scooping up soil and ice, and analyzing the samples in minuscule ovens and mixing bowls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, named the Phoenix Mars Lander, will be looking for traces of organic compounds in the baked and moistened samples, which would be a possible indicator of conditions favorable for life, either now or in the past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If organic compounds are present on Mars, they are most likely preserved in ice. That is why NASA is aiming for the planet's high northern latitudes, where ice is almost certainly lurking just beneath the surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about six inches of soft red soil should cover the ice, and so the digger should not have to probe too deeply. The ice is expected to be as hard as concrete, and a drill on the scoop will help gather frozen samples. Some dirt and ice samples will be baked and their vapors analyzed. Other soil samples will be mixed with water on the craft and the muddy soup will be examined by onboard microscopes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars landings are especially risky. Only 5 of the 15 American, Russian and European efforts have worked, all of them American successes beginning with the 1976 Viking touchdowns. The Phoenix team said it did everything possible to test for failures and will continue to do so as the spacecraft flies to Mars. The entire mission costs $420 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has never tried to land a spacecraft on Mars at such a high northern latitude. A lander intended for the red planet's South Pole went silent immediately upon arrival in 1999. That failure, combined with the loss of the companion Mars orbiter, prompted NASA to cancel a 2001 lander mission. The parts from that scrapped mission were used for the Phoenix, so its name alludes to the mythological bird that rises from its own ashes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix could help pave the way for human visitors, especially if it confirms the presence of frozen water in large amounts near the pole, said Michael Meyer, the lead Mars scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel looking into the physical and psychological health issues of astronauts heard anecdotes of astronauts' drinking within 12 hours before flight and of two instances in which astronauts were drunk enough to be considered a safety risk.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven members of the crew of the current mission of the space shuttle Endeavour include a teacher-astronaut, an electrician-turned-chemist, combat pilots and a doctor. The mission, which is officially designated as STS-118, will bring new structural elements up to the International Space Station and carry on the process of building the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott J. Kelly, the commander on this mission, is also a commander in the Navy. He is 43 and was born in Orange, N.J. He and his wife, the former Leslie S. Yandell, have two children.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Kelly graduated from the State University of New York Maritime College, and earned a masters in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee. His twin brother, Mark, served as pilot of the shuttle Discovery on a mission last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA selected Commander Kelly for the astronaut corps in 1996, and he has flown in space once before: as pilot on a flight in 1999 aboard the shuttle Discovery to the Hubble Space Telescope.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview earlier this year, he said that even though the number of missions is dwindling, ''I would like to fly another shuttle flight,'' and even a long-duration stint on the International Space Station. ''I have no desire to do anything else, so I hope I can fly again,'' he said. ''I like this job.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in this office for 11 years, I've spent eight days in space. So being an astronaut is clearly not only about what you do when you're flying in space, it's about all those other things as well.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Owen Hobaugh, the pilot, is a lieutenant colonel in the United States Marine Corps. He is 45, and was born in Bar Harbor, Me. and is married to the former Corinna Lynn Learman; they have four children. Colonel Hobaugh, whose nickname is ''Scorch,'' earned his college degree in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy. His official NASA biography states that he enjoys a full slate of physical activity, including weightlifting, skiing, and triathlons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Commander Kelly, he was selected by NASA to join the astronaut corps in 1996, and has flown one previous mission, in 2001. He said that the shutdown on the shuttle program in 2010 puts pressure on astronauts. ''It's sometimes tough when you get a job -- that the purpose of the job is to fly in space -- and your mechanism to get into space starts to dwindle down,'' he said. ''So that part of it's just a little stressful, a little hard to just endure the wait,'' and wonder if there will be another shot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the shuttle, itself, he called the aging craft ''a remarkable vehicle. It's going to be sad to see it go. But we're taking a step up in safety when we go on to our next vehicle,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daffydd Rhys Williams, an astronaut from the Canadian Space Agency, was born in Saskatoon. Dr. Williams goes by Dave; his father gave him the name Daffydd as a tribute to the family's Welsh heritage. ''So of course in elementary school it was always very hard, because I'd go and the teachers would think that I spelled my name wrong, you know, and they'd be correcting,'' he said. ''And I'd go, 'No, no, this is really how it's spelled.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is 53 and is married, with two children; he graduated from McGill University in Montreal, and received his medical training there as well. He was chosen as a Canadian astronaut in 1992, and came to NASA in 1995, and flew aboard the shuttle Columbia in a mission in 1998, where he performed life science experiments with the rest of the crew. He has also served as director of the space and life sciences directorate at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the flight, he will perform two spacewalks, and a third if the mission is extended. He will be replacing a 1200-pound gyroscope -- a tricky job. Though things to not weigh anything in space, he said, they still have mass. ''So imagine, you know, being like on a giant air hockey table and grabbing onto this thing that weighs 1,200 pounds and moving it around,'' he said, ''and what's interesting is you learn very quickly: you don't want things to go fast. Because it's very hard to stop something that's 1,200 pounds when it's moving quickly. So when you see us doing space walks, it's small fingertip motions, very gradually moving something, very gradual inputs to get something going and very slow inputs to stop something moving.'' And, he added, the objects are moving in three dimensions instead of just two.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been to space once before, he said, the experience and the sensations persist. ''I can very easily have the sense of being in this office right now and floating out of my chair and floating up to the ceiling if I wanted to push off,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Radding Morgan is the best known member of the crew because of her role as the educator astronaut. Ms. Morgan had been selected as the backup ''teacher in space'' for Christa McAuliffe for the January 1986 flight of the shuttle Challenger. After the Challenger broke apart during launching and its crew of seven died, NASA named her the teacher in space designee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan was selected as a full-fledged member of the astronaut corps in 1998. Now 55, she is married to Clay Morgan and they have two sons. She has taught in Idaho and Ecuador, and said that exploring the world -- and what is above it -- comes naturally to her as a teacher. ''As classroom teachers,'' she said, ''we are always looking for opportunities and ways to increase our learning and learn more about the world so that we can do a better job bringing the world to our students and our classrooms.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the mission, she will be responsible for transferring 5,000 pounds of supplies and equipment between the shuttle and the space station, and will operate the shuttle and station robotic arms. And as one of four of NASA's educator astronauts, she will take part in as many as three 20-minute education sessions with education centers in Idaho, Alexandria, Va. and Lynn, Mass. ''Eventually, I do plan on going back to the classroom,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers don't always get respect, she said. Even when she was interviewing in hopes of being selected for the teacher in space program, an NASA representative looked at her resume and said, ''You know, you could have done anything. Why are you teaching?'' She replied, ''Because it's so important to me, and it's the best job in the world.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Mastracchio, who is 47, is from Waterbury, Conn. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Connecticut and two masters degrees. He is married, and has three children. He had worked with NASA contractors  <span class="companylink">Hamilton Standard</span> and Rockwell Shuttle Operations Company, and first joined NASA in 1990 as an engineer in flight crew operations before entering the astronaut corps in 1996.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Can't keep a job,'' he deadpanned. Moving around the organization, he said, provided ''a pretty good background. I have a good background knowledge of how the space shuttle works and what makes it fly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His previous flight was aboard Atlantis in 2000, when he and the rest of the crew spent an 11-day mission preparing the International Space Station for its first permanent crew by bringing up nearly 7,000 pounds of supplies, as well as installing essentials like a treadmill and a toilet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has always been honest with his children, who are now grown, about the risks of space flight. ''They know that this is something I want to do,'' he said, ''and I say to them, as I say to my wife, 'Hey, if anything happens, just know that this is something I believe in and I want to do it. And, you know, havea good time after I'm gone. You know, don't worry about me.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracy E. Caldwell, a Californian who is 38, will have a birthday in space on Aug. 14. She has a doctorate in physical chemistry from the University of California at Davis. This will be her first space flight, and she will be working the shuttle's robotic arm to inspect the shuttle's heat tiles for launch damage and work with spacewalking astronauts from inside the spacecraft, among other tasks. Back on earth, she is a vocalist in the astronaut band Max Q.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process of building the station has a familiar feel, she said, because ''I grew up not just the daughter of an electrician, but also one of his employees,'' she said. ''My whole life has been spent on construction sites. And that's, in those assembly missions, that's exactly what the space station is.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the best advice she's received, she said, is about using the bathroom in space. ''Women have different equipment than men, and how you position yourself and what to expect, and, you know, just how to overcome just the challenges of holding yourself still and doing something that takes a little bit more time than it does here on earth.'' So previous fliers have helped her to understand ''what to expect, and just how you can let that be a part of your normal day without too many problems.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a comfort, she said, to have someone who has been there ''telling you, 'hey, it's not a big deal,' '' she said. ''And that's not just with using the bathroom, it's just everything.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Benjamin Alvin Drew, Jr. is in the Air Force and is the newest member of the crew. He was assigned just four months before the flight after NASA officials decided to send astronaut Clay Anderson to replace Sunita Williams aboard the International Space Station on an earlier shuttle mission than had been originally planned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his Air Force career, Colonel Drew flew combat missions in the in Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama, in 1989, and in first Gulf War. He is 43, was selected by NASA in 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is from Washington, D.C. and is single. He was shocked to get the call about joining this mission. ''My mindset at the time when I got the phone call, at that point, was to be working as a Capcom,'' or capsule communicator -- the astronaut on the ground who speaks directly with the orbiting astronauts during the mission. He had been working with station crews in that capacity for three years, and was hoping to work shuttle missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Col. Steven Lindsey, the head of the astronaut office, called on a Friday afternoon, he thought it might have been about a mistake he might have made during a simulation run. ''It's either really good or really bad,'' he recalled thinking. Colonel Lindsey opened the conversation by telling Colonel Drew that he would not be the Capcom on the next mission. ''So my initial thought was, 'boy, I must have really had a bad day out here on Mission Control -- I must have really impressed people the wrong way.' '' Then Colonel Lindsey told him the reason. ''And that was the first time in my life I was speechless,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming into the mission so late in the game, he said, makes him ''the chief asker of dumb questions in the crew, like 'why are we doing it this way?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the time, he said, the answer is, ''Oh, don't ask us, because we've been through five iterations of that and this is what we finally settled on.'' But ''sometimes people go, 'Hey, we didn't think about that.' '' He has suggested placing a live camera in the stowage module so that bags that are hard to identify can be held in front of the camera and experts on the ground can help to quickly resolve confusion that can typically take up enormous amounts of time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that he will be busy throughout the mission, and has taken on tasks that other members of the crew had so that they could focus on their most critical work, like spacewalks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So I really didn't need any glory,'' he said. ''Knowing you were the seventh crewmember to join out of seven, there's no point in trying to get a starring role.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- Barbara R. Morgan is now an astronaut by profession, heading into space this week for the first time on the space shuttle. But she said she would be approaching her mission ''with the mind, eyes, ears and heart of a teacher.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's what I am, a teacher,'' Ms. Morgan said, ''That's what I am at my core.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said patience and perseverance were virtues that defined good schoolteachers. Living her principles, she is about to fulfill a two-decade-old dream by becoming the first ''educator astronaut'' when she and six fellow astronauts blast off in the space shuttle Endeavour on Wednesday on a mission to the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight will also fulfill a dream deferred from January 1986, when the shuttle Challenger blew up during takeoff, killing a crew that included the first designated teacher in space, Christa McAuliffe, Ms. Morgan's friend. A high school teacher from Concord, N.H., Ms. McAuliffe had planned a series of educational sessions from space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not losing faith in the program, Ms. Morgan, as the backup teacher for that mission, kept the dream alive even when returning to the classroom by becoming an advocate for spaceflight and helping the National Aeronautics and Space Administration find a way to continue including teacher-astronauts in its plans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe in my heart that space exploration is key for all of us, especially for our young people to keep their futures open-ended,'' she said in a preflight news conference.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of Challenger proved to NASA that flying on the shuttle would never be routine, leaving no room for mere passengers like teachers or tourists. But the agency liked the concept of a teacher in space and in 1998 hit upon the idea of training teachers to be real astronauts, just as it trains scientists and other professionals to be mission specialists.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan got the call after she had gone back to teaching elementary school in McCall, Idaho, and returned to NASA that year to become the first educator astronaut. Since that time, three other teachers have entered the program and are awaiting their chance to fly in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Endeavour's 11- to 14-day mission is a busy one involving attaching a 5,000-pound girder section to the space station's backbone, transferring thousands of pounds of supplies and parts, and testing a new system that lets the shuttle stay longer by drawing electrical power from the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the tightly scheduled mission, Ms. Morgan's primary jobs are operating the shuttle's robot arm during three planned space walks and helping in the transfer of 5,000 pounds of cargo, including food and science instruments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of all her astronaut duties, only six hours are set aside for Ms. Morgan solely for education. She is to participate in at least one interactive video broadcast with students on earth, with two others planned if the mission is extended to 14 days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main part of the educational program will happen when we return to earth,'' she said. Ms. Morgan plans to make a series of video ''teachable moments'' while in space that will later be used in lessons, and she is taking 10 million basil seeds that will be distributed to students to raise in growth chambers that they will design.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The educational activities we've designed are interactive and interesting, fun activities they can get into,'' she said, ''It's not about teachers standing up and talking in front of a blackboard.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McAuliffe and the six astronauts who died in the Challenger accident will be remembered on this mission, she said. ''The legacy of Christa and the Challenger crew is open-ended.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan said she would be taking mementos associated with Ms. McAuliffe but would not disclose what they were. ''Christa was, is, and always will be our 'Teacher in Space,' our first teacher to fly,'' she said in a NASA interview.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 22 years since NASA first selected Ms. Morgan to fly does not seem as long to her as many people think. ''It really hasn't been waiting, it's been working,'' she said. ''Working as a teacher, and working to be an astronaut.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan, 55, said her husband, Clay Morgan, a writer and former ''smoke jumper'' who fought forest fires, and her two sons, one a high school senior and the other a college freshman, have been supportive and understanding. ''Clay and the boys will be at the launch,'' she said, ''I'm sure they have some concerns, but they know it's important and they are excited.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teacher-astronaut said she was looking forward to returning to the classroom after her flight to share her experiences. But she also would love to fly again. ''I'll be available,'' she said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Aug. 8 -- The space shuttle Endeavour lifted off into humid skies on Wednesday evening, carrying pieces of the International Space Station and a living reminder of the loss of the shuttle Challenger two decades ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the Endeavour's astronauts, Barbara R. Morgan, was the backup to Christa McAuliffe for the teacher-in-space program in 1986. Ms. Morgan was one of the spectators at the Kennedy Space Center when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds into flight on Jan. 28, 1986, killing Ms. McAuliffe and the other six astronauts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Endeavour passed the 73-second mark on Wednesday night, Rob Nevias, providing commentary from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said Ms. Morgan was ''racing toward space on the wings of a legacy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Challenger accident, Ms. Morgan returned to work as an elementary school teacher in Idaho. Later, she decided she wanted to be an astronaut and joined the astronaut corps in 1998.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this flight, her first, she is not a teacher but a mission specialist. Her primary task will be operating the shuttle's robotic arm while other astronauts are conducting spacewalks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she is scheduled to conduct at least one video question-and-answer session with students on the ground. If the mission is extended to 14 days from 11, she will conduct two additional sessions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatives of the Challenger astronauts were invited to the Endeavour launching. Several, including June Scobee Rodgers, widow of the Challenger's commander, Francis R. Scobee, attended.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixty of the 114 finalists for the teacher-in-space program watched the Endeavour's launching, including Stephanie Wright, who also watched the final Challenger launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Ms. Morgan is now in space is ''an absolute fantastic dream come true for educators and children across the country,'' Dr. Wright said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour is carrying a 4,000-pound truss segment and other pieces to be installed on the space station. Three spacewalks are planned, with the possibility of a fourth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is scheduled to last 11 days, but mission managers plan to extend it if a new system that allows the shuttle to plug into the space station's 120-volt power system works as designed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would allow the Endeavour, whose electronic systems run on 28 volts, to conserve the power in its fuel cells.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cmdr. Scott J. Kelly of the Navy is the mission's commander, and the pilot is Lt. Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Ms. Morgan, the other crew members are Tracy E. Caldwell, Col. Benjamin A. Drew Jr. of the Air Force, Richard A. Mastracchio, and Dafydd R. Williams of the Canadian Space Agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mission is the Endeavour's 20th, and its first in nearly five years. After it landed on Dec. 7, 2002, it went into a hangar for a major overhaul, one that had already been done on the other shuttles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of the Columbia in February 2003 extended the Endeavour's stay on the ground. The 194 modifications included a modern ''glass cockpit,'' the system for plugging into the space station, a system for monitoring the three engines during launching, and global positioning system receivers. In addition, 2,045 of Endeavour's heat tiles and blankets were replaced, as were 3,223 ''gap fillers'' between tiles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a new space shuttle,'' N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, said at a news conference on Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparently flawless liftoff puts behind, at least for now, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's public relations turmoil of a couple of weeks ago. First, a Congressional committee criticized the agency for losing $94 million of office equipment over 10 years. Then, an internal report reviewing physical and psychological records of astronauts turned up two anecdotes of astronauts showing up for launching drunk, and NASA officials later revealed that electronic equipment destined for the space station had been sabotaged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is investigating the accusations of alcohol abuse by astronauts. But Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said at a news conference after the launching, ''I will be extraordinarily surprised if there's anything really there.'' Dr. Griffin said the last 10 years of shuttle and Soyuz launchings had been reviewed, and ''we can't even find where it would be a possibility.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Kelly also criticized news reports in a letter to some newspapers. ''To imply that my crew or I would ever consider launching on our mission in anything but the best possible condition is utterly ridiculous,'' he wrote.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The damaged electronic equipment, a device that gathers data from strain sensors on the station, was repaired and is being carried aboard the Endeavour to the space station as originally planned.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>668 words</div><div>11 August 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A piece of debris hit the underside of the space shuttle Endeavour during liftoff on Wednesday and gouged a small but potentially worrisome divot in a heat shield tile, NASA officials said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gouge, spotted via images taken by the crew of the International Space Station as the Endeavour approached docking yesterday afternoon, is small, about three inches wide. Still, there were some visual indications that it might be deep.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What does this mean?'' John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team, said at a news conference yesterday. ''I don't know at this point.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts will conduct a closer examination on Sunday, using a laser tool attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to measure its exact shape. Based upon that information, NASA engineers will analyze how much heat might reach the Endeavour's underlying structure when the spacecraft re-enters Earth's atmosphere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If necessary, the astronauts could repair the damage during one of their planned spacewalks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space shuttles have suffered damage, sometimes significant, to the thermal tiles during earlier missions and returned safely. During the first shuttle mission, that of the Columbia in 1981, an entire tile fell off, but that was in a spot that did not encounter the most searing temperatures of re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has been carefully monitoring liftoff debris ever since the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven in February 2003. That orbiter disintegrated during re-entry because of hot gases that entered through a hole punched in the left wing by a 1.67-pound piece of foam that fell from the external fuel tank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, NASA officials reported that nine pieces of debris were spotted during liftoff and that three of them might have hit the orbiter. They said all nine pieces appeared to be small.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, however, Mr. Shannon said radar readings suggested that the object that hit the shuttle 58 seconds into the flight was made of ice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That perked up our ears a little bit,'' he said, ''because ice is much more dense of course than foam and can do more damage to tile.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The videos of the launching did not capture the original object, only the spray of debris after it hit the underside.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a procedure instituted after the Columbia disaster, the Endeavour performed a slow backflip yesterday as it neared the space station to dock. That allowed the station crew to take high-resolution video and still images of the shuttle's underside, and those images revealed the gouge, located about four feet behind the landing gear door on the right wing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the Endeavour had a close miss soon after it reached orbit, passing about one mile from a burned-out stage of a Delta rocket, one of thousands of pieces of space junk circling Earth. Mission managers considered a maneuver to pass farther from the rocket, but it proved unnecessary.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour spent yesterday morning closing in on the space station. As the two spacecraft passed over the South Pacific at 2:02 p.m. Eastern time, they gently bumped together and docked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a custom that has been transferred from naval ships to space stations, Fyodor N. Yurchikhin, the station commander, rang a bell to signal the arrival of the new guests. ''Endeavour arrive to I.S.S. station,'' he said in English. ''Welcome on board.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hatches were opened about two hours later.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had really a flawless rendezvous from start to finish,'' said Matt Abbott, NASA's lead flight director for this mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new system that allows the shuttle to draw power from the space station was plugged in and appeared to be working. That will allow the Endeavour to stay docked at the space station for 10 days, or three days longer than it could otherwise.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Aug. 12 -- A close-up laser inspection by astronauts on the space shuttle Endeavour revealed on Sunday that a three-and-a-half-inch gouge penetrates all the way through thermal tiles on the shuttle's belly, and left NASA officials urgently calculating whether a spacewalk for repairs is needed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chunk of insulating foam ricocheted off a fuel tank and smacked the shuttle during liftoff last week, carving out the gouge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unevenly shaped gouge, which straddles two side-by-side heat shield tiles and the corner of a third, is 3.5 inches long and just over 2 inches wide. The inspection on Sunday showed that the damage went through the one-inch-thick thermal tiles, exposing the felt material sandwiched between the tiles and the shuttle's aluminum frame.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers expect to decide Monday or Tuesday whether to send astronauts out to patch the gouge. Engineers are trying to determine whether the marred area can withstand the searing heat of atmospheric re-entry at the flight's end. Heating tests will be conducted on similarly damaged samples.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have really prepared for exactly this case, since Columbia,'' said John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team. ''We have spent a lot of money in the program and a lot of time and a lot of people's efforts to be ready to handle exactly this case.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The damaged tiles are near the right main landing gear door. In a stroke of luck, they are beneath the aluminum framework for the right wing, which would offer extra protection during the ride back to Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is subjected to as much as 2,300 degrees in re-entry. A hole large and deep enough could lead to another disaster like the loss of the Columbia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Endeavour will remain docked at the space station until Aug. 20, for a record 10-day stay. Mission managers on Sunday approved the prolonged visit based on the successful testing of a new shuttle system that draws power from the station.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small but deep gouge in the underside of the space shuttle Endeavour does not pose the potential of catastrophe, the NASA official overseeing the mission said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't even know if I have to go to fix this at all,'' said John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team at a news conference. ''This is not a catastrophic loss-of-orbiter case at all.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, engineers are continuing computer simulations and experiments to determine how much heating of the shuttle's underlying structure the gouge would cause during re-entry through the atmosphere, and a spacewalk to repair the gouge is under consideration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the orbiter is not in danger, fixing the gouge in space may prevent further damage that may require lengthy repairs before its next flight, Mr. Shannon said. ''This is a case where you want to do the prudent thing for the vehicle,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, work by the shuttle's astronauts at the International Space Station continued. During a 6 hour 28 minute spacewalk, Richard A. Mastracchio of NASA and Dafydd R. Williams of the Canadian Space Agency replaced a broken gyroscope on the space station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gouge occurred during liftoff Wednesday, when a piece of foam insulation fell off the external fuel tank 58 seconds into flight, ricocheted off a strut holding the tank to the orbiter and then slammed into ceramic heat tiles on the orbiter's belly. Engineers do not know if the piece included any of the denser material below the foam or ice that formed when the tank was filled with ultracold liquid oxygen and hydrogen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gouge is about three inches across. A small part of it, about 0.2 inch by 1 inch, runs through the entire 1.12-inch thickness of the heat tile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery appeared to have suffered similar damage during a flight in 1988, the first after the loss of the Challenger in 1986. On landing, a gouge extending through the Discovery's tile was found, and six tiles had to be replaced. But no damage occurred to the craft's underlying structure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has paid much more attention to the thermal tiles after the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven in February 2003. The Columbia disintegrated during re-entry because of hot gases entering through a hole that had been punched in the left wing by a 1.67-pound piece of foam falling from the external tank during liftoff.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the Columbia's final mission, NASA engineers never even knew where the falling foam had hit, and they lacked the ability to do sophisticated simulations to gauge the potential damage and how much heating would occur during re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, NASA has developed tools that allow it to see the damage precisely. Researchers at NASA's Ames Research Center in California and the Langley Research Center in Virginia adapted existing computer programs for analyzing the heating effects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, the Endeavour astronauts used a 50-foot boom containing a camera and a laser scanner attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to take a close-up look at the gouge and determine its shape.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said he expected that computer simulations that would calculate the flow of air and the heating of the damaged area would be completed today and that experiments on tiles gouged in the same way as those on the Endeavour would be completed by tomorrow, when mission managers are likely to decide whether to put an astronaut on the end of the boom to fix the gouge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of engineers has started considering which of three repair options would work best, Mr. Shannon said. The simplest is to paint the area with a black wash that would help reflect the heat. A second option is to screw in a heat-resistant plate over the damaged area. The third is to squirt a caulk-like material into the gouge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all the new tools, the main change in NASA's space shuttle operations may be one of mind-set. Even with limited information and software tools, engineers working on the Columbia mission calculated that the falling foam could have gouged a hole up to 32 inches long and 7 inches wide and extending to the depth of the tile, a gouge far larger than that seen in the Endeavour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, mission managers still cleared the Columbia for its ill-fated return and continued for weeks to doubt that the foam had played a role in the disaster.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara R. Morgan got back to teaching yesterday. The students were in Idaho; she was in space, orbiting aboard the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lesson was just over 20 minutes, but it was supposed to make up for more than 20 years, and it had a bittersweet air for those who knew the history. The last time NASA tried to send a teacher into space, Christa McAuliffe in 1986, the shuttle Challenger broke up 73 seconds into the flight, killing all seven crew members. Ms. Morgan, a teacher from Idaho who was Ms. McAuliffe's backup, was at Kennedy Space Center, watching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event yesterday was the culmination of a summer of space-related activities at the Discovery Center of Idaho, in Boise. Ms. Morgan, who is now what the space agency calls an educator astronaut, told the students that being an astronaut was not so different from being a teacher, at least in some ways.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We explore, we discover and we share,'' she said. And both ''are absolutely wonderful jobs.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan shared the spotlight with three floating colleagues -- Dr. Dafydd Williams of the Canadian Space Agency, Col. Benjamin A. Drew of the Air Force and Clayton C. Anderson, a space station astronaut. They mugged for the young audience, playing with a softball, slurping drinks in microgravity and demonstrating exercise by having Ms. Morgan lift Dr. Williams and Colonel Drew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan will have two more sessions, with children in Virginia and Massachusetts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Challenger accident, Ms. Morgan returned to teaching in Idaho, but found herself drawn back to NASA in 1998. In her newly created role at the agency, she received full training and was expected to be an integral part of shuttle missions, but she would teach, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Aug. 8, she got her long-deferred dream, and NASA has made the most of the moment's emotional punch. As the shuttle roared into space, the launching announcer, Rob Navias, said, ''Morgan, racing toward space on the wings of a legacy.'' And when the Endeavour reached orbit, Mr. Navias added, ''For Barbara Morgan and her crewmates, class is in session.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the talk of teaching, most of Ms. Morgan's time in space is devoted to her duties as an astronaut, including her operation of the shuttle's robotic arm to inspect the shuttle's delicate heat shield for signs of damage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That work gave details on the three-inch-long gash that an errant chunk of insulating foam made in the underbelly of the shuttle during ascent. Mission managers said yesterday that preliminary computer simulations indicated that the shuttle could fly back as is, with temperatures of the underlying aluminum skin remaining under 325 degrees during re-entry. The managers will make a decision on whether to try a repair after experiments heating similarly gouged tiles and checks of the simulation results.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the children asked the kind of question that many people watching coverage of the flight have wondered about, said Doug Lambuth, a spokesman for the Discovery Center. ''You mean questions like 'Are you going to be able to make it back?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. Lambuth said, spontaneity was in short supply. The questions ''are cast in concrete,'' he acknowledged. ''It's pretty scripted.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for all the waiting, the session itself was little more than the standard astronaut question-and-answer volley, with the other astronauts answering more of the questions than Ms. Morgan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the students noticed, they did not seem to mind. In an interview last week, Sarah Blum, a seventh-grader from Moscow, called it a moment of Idaho pride.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think Idaho's just a potato state,'' said Sarah, whose father had been a high school teacher in McCall when Ms. Morgan taught elementary school there. ''I think it's cool that she's from Idaho and she's getting to do this.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zakkary Schirmeister, who is 11 and lives in McCall, asked his question: what do the stars look like from where you are?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts explained that without atmosphere, the stars do not twinkle -- and since the station is brightly lighted, it is hard to see the stars. Ms. Morgan said it was like the difference between seeing the stars at night from Boise and seeing them from the more rural McCall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison Escarziga had just a few miles to travel to get to the center. Like all of the children, she was chosen because of her interest in science, which is ''really cool,'' she said. ''I like learning about experiments. I am really interested in atoms. It's so amazing -- they build up everything!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elisha Mabey and her parents made the five-hour drive from Rirey, a town of fewer than 600. At the age of 12, she is already considering her career options. At the moment, she said, ''I'm still deciding between being an astronaut and a teacher.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, she said, ''You could be a teacher and go up into space as an astronaut.''   </p>

</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY   </div><div>599 words</div><div>16 August 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 -- Astronomers have discovered that a giant star that has been studied for centuries is streaking across the sky trailing an enormous, cometlike tail.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists said Wednesday that they were stunned to learn that the giant red star, Mira, zipping through the Milky Way galaxy 300 times faster than a speeding bullet, has a turbulent tail stretching trillions of miles across space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was shocked when I first saw this completely unexpected humongous tail trailing behind a well-known star,'' said Christopher Martin of the California Institute of Technology, principal scientist for the Galaxy Evolution Explorer spacecraft, also known as the Galex, that discovered the tail.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., surveys the sky with an instrument highly sensitive to ultraviolet light.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft noticed an unusual glow around Mira, scientists said, and inspection showed the tail and other features surrounding Mira that were visible just in ultraviolet light. That helps explain how other observatories missed them, the team said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mira is an old star of a class called a red giant that represents the end stages of stars like our Sun, which will evolve into a red giant in four billion or five billion years, scientists said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mira is 400 times the size of the Sun, but with only about the same mass. Dying red giants spew material into space that eventually becomes building material for new stars and planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Seibert, a research associate at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institute of Washington in Pasadena, said Mira expanded and contracted every 332 days, making it periodically visible with the naked eye from Earth. Mira, which travels with a distant companion believed to be a compact white dwarf star, is in the constellation Cetus (the whale) 350 light-years from Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published in the Aug. 16 edition of the journal Nature, the researchers said the Galex craft also found a bow shockwave in front of the star and two streams of material coming from its front and back. The shockwave is caused by the speeding star's plowing into relatively stable interstellar hydrogen and other molecules, compressing and heating the material as it flows back around the star, similar to a boat's moving through water.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, researchers said they believed that hot gas in the bow shockwave was heating the gas blowing off the star, causing it to fluoresce with ultraviolet light. This glowing material then swirls around behind the star, creating a turbulent tail-like wake.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mira tail is 13 light-years long and represents material shed by the star over the last 30,000 years, the scientists said. A light-year is the distance light travels over a year in a vacuum, about six trillion miles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martin said that the tail might have been even longer but that it had faded over time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Shara, curator of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, said astronomers could study the Mira tail to map the composition of the mass it has shed over time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's leaving behind the seeds for formation of other stars,'' Mr. Shara said. ''This is insight into the death process of stars and their renewal.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a change of plans, astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavour will spend today studying plans for conducting a repair of the shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers have not made a decision to carry out the repair, to patch a small gash on the underside of the Endeavour, and they said experimental and computational results so far indicated that no repair was necessary and that the Endeavour could fly home as is.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The analysis that we have shows there would be no damage at all to the underlying structure, which was very good news to us,'' John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team, said at a news conference last night. ''That was all good news, but it was not a 100 percent story. It was more like an 85 percent story.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep options open for one more day, the fourth spacewalk by Endeavour astronauts during the current mission has been pushed back a day, to Saturday. The original activities planned for the spacewalk were for construction of the International Space Station. If astronauts perform the tile repair instead, the Endeavour's stay at the space station may be extended and a fifth spacewalk added to the schedule.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is further clouded because during the third spacewalk, conducted Wednesday, one of the astronauts tore a small hole in one of his gloves, and the spacewalk ended early.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has spacewalkers periodically look at their gloves, since the discovery of a cut in a glove used by an astronaut during the last shuttle mission. During one of these checks yesterday about 3 p.m. Eastern time, Richard A. Mastracchio spotted a hole near the thumb of his left glove.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No air leaked out of Mr. Mastracchio's suit, but as a precaution, mission controllers sent him back inside.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hole indicates a sharp edge somewhere on the outside of the space station that might pose a danger to other spacewalkers or unexpected wear and tear on the glove.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got quite a bit of work to do over the next couple of days before we commit'' to another spacewalk, said Stephen C. Doering, who heads the office responsible for planning spacewalks. ''We need to fully understand the situation that is in front of us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doering said, however, that the glove issue would not delay a spacewalk to conduct a repair if mission managers decided that one was necessary.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During liftoff a week ago, a piece of foam fell from the Endeavour's external fuel tank, bounced off a strut and hit the underside of the orbiter, an event reminiscent of the falling foam that doomed the shuttle Columbia in 2003. When the Columbia re-entered the atmosphere, hot gases streamed in through a gaping hole in the left wing that had been punched open by the foam, leading to the disintegration of the orbiter and the deaths of the seven astronauts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The piece of foam that hit the Columbia weighed 1.67 pounds and was the size of a suitcase. The piece that hit the Endeavour was much smaller, about 4 inches by 3.8 inches by 1.8 inches, and weighed about one-third of an ounce. The gouge that resulted is about three inches wide, and engineers have already concluded that it does not pose a threat of catastrophe to the crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers have said that if the heat of re-entry was likely to cause additional damage requiring lengthy repairs on the ground, they would send the astronauts on an extra spacewalk to patch the site.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While confident that a repair was within the capabilities of the astronauts, mission managers also want to avoid unnecessary risks. Mr. Shannon said that this type of spacewalk, underneath the shuttle, had never been done before, that the tool for squirting a caulklike material into the gouge had not been tested in space and that the repair could conceivably make the situation worse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of these are real showstoppers,'' Mr. Shannon said, ''but you kind of have to add them up in your mind.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, leaving the area untouched does not appear to pose serious problems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In heat tile experiments conducted Tuesday night, a duplicate of the Endeavour's gouge was carved into a two-foot array of tiles. That sample was then placed into a facility called an arc jet, essentially a room-size blowtorch, blowing hot, hypersonic winds that simulate the heat of re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the temperature at the surface of the undamaged tiles exceeded 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the bottom of the gouge peaked at only 340 degrees in the test compared with 300 degrees for undamaged tiles. An increase of 40 degrees would not overly heat the underlying structure, Mr. Shannon said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the arc jet tests do not fully recreate the details of the air flow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer simulations, also carried out by NASA scientists, can better capture the conditions of re-entry, but the limits of computing power require simplifying the shape of the gouge. To compare the computer results and the experimental results, another test with a set of tiles with the simplified gouge was conducted in the arc jet facility on Wednesday night.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sounds like they know what they are doing,'' said G. Scott Hubbard, who served on the panel that investigated the Columbia accident and is a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas D. Osheroff, a professor of physics at Stanford and another member of the Columbia panel, said, ''What we're seeing is a much healthier attitude by NASA.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Dr. Osheroff said he thought NASA should perform the repair, regardless. ''I don't see that it can hurt,'' he said. ''NASA ought to get some experience with the stuff in case they really need to use it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Endeavour returns -- landing is, at least for now, scheduled for next Wednesday -- ''I will cross my fingers on re-entry,'' Dr. Osheroff said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Convinced that a small gouge in the belly of the space shuttle Endeavour poses no danger, NASA managers decided last night not to send astronauts on a spacewalk to repair it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts will proceed with previously planned work on the International Space Station, including a spacewalk scheduled for tomorrow. The Endeavour will return to Earth next week. Landing is scheduled for Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers had spent days scrutinizing photographs, running computer simulations and conducting experiments to predict what would happen to the gouge area as searing gases flowed along the shuttle's underside during re-entry. While the heat would erode some of the tile, they concluded that there was no danger of the gases' burning through the skin or even causing damage to the underlying aluminum structure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't clear anything until we have the data to clear it,'' John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team, said last night at a news conference.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The management team made its decision at a meeting that lasted almost five hours. The news was radioed to the shuttle crew at 9 p.m. Eastern time, just before they went to sleep.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers unanimously agreed that the gouge ''was not a threat to crew safety,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''We had thought that for several days, but we were waiting for the final analysis to be complete.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second decision, not to conduct a repair spacewalk as an added precaution to prevent any damage that might require repairs on the ground, ''was not unanimous, but it was pretty overwhelming,'' Mr. Shannon said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said engineers from the Johnson Space Center in Houston thought it would be ''prudent'' to do the repair, but engineers from the other NASA centers agreed it was unnecessary.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle suffered the damage when a piece of foam, about 4 inches by 3.8 inches by 1.8 inches, fell off the external fuel tank 58 seconds after liftoff and hit the underside. The gouge is about three inches wide. Over a small area, 0.2 inches by 1 inch, the gouge passes through the entire thickness of the tile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the computer simulations and experiments indicated the underlying aluminum structure would remain below 350 degrees Fahrenheit during re-entry and not suffer any damage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of that, Mr. Shannon said it was not worth subjecting the astronauts to the risks of a spacewalk to the underside of the shuttle, which has never been done.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers are also still analyzing how Richard A. Mastracchio, one of the astronauts on a spacewalk Wednesday, tore a hole in the outer layer of a glove.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potentially complicating NASA's planning is Hurricane Dean. By the middle of the week, the storm could be in the Gulf of Mexico just as mission controllers would be preparing for the Endeavour's landing.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Hurricane Dean headed toward the Gulf of Mexico, the space shuttle Endeavour undocks from the International Space Station today, a day early, and is scheduled to land Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worry is that the hurricane may threaten Houston, site of mission control, the Johnson Space Center. In that case, NASA would transfer flight operations to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the shuttle is scheduled to land. Moving the landing day forward to Tuesday should preclude that possibility.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Dean was expected to pass south of Houston, with landfall in northern Mexico, but mission managers decided to take precautions in case the storm takes a right turn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be irresponsible for us to not pay attention to this storm,'' LeRoy Cain, chairman of the mission management team, said at a news conference yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the shuttle to land Tuesday, astronauts had to finish packing up and close the hatches to the space station last night. This required shortening a fourth spacewalk by the Endeavour's astronauts yesterday to five hours from the planned six and a half.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts retrieved two experiments from the outside of the space station that will return to Earth on the Endeavour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After undocking this morning, the shuttle crew will spend a couple of days preparing for landing, including conducting another inspection of the shuttle's nose cone and the leading edge of the wings to make sure they did not suffer any damage from micrometeoroids while docked to the space station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the storm is approaching Houston, flight controllers will land the Endeavour at one of three sites on Tuesday -- either at the Kennedy center or at backup sites in California and New Mexico. If it is not approaching Houston, and weather does not permit landing in Florida, controllers will have the shuttle stay in orbit another day before considering backup sites.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour has enough supplies to stay in orbit until Friday, but barring a major mechanical problem, it will land no later than Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the mission, NASA engineers spent a lot of time analyzing the effects of a small gouge in the underside of the Endeavour's belly, caused by foam falling from the external fuel tank at liftoff.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After conducting experiments, mission managers decided no repair was necessary. Otherwise, the mission has gone smoothly. ''Endeavour has been a very clean and great-running vehicle,'' Mr. Cain said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Crawford, Tex., where President Bush was on vacation, aides said he had approved a request from Gov. Rick Perry for a ''pre-landfall emergency declaration,'' which allows federal assistance, and federal coordination with federal authorities, to flow into a state ahead of a storm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, told reporters that the president was carefully following the storm's path.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confronted with the same kind of problem that doomed the space shuttle Columbia, NASA officials, chastened by years of criticism and upheaval in the agency, took a markedly different approach during the current mission of the Endeavour, calling on an array of new tools and procedures to analyze and respond to the problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Columbia faced much more serious damage -- a 6- to 10-inch hole punched in a wing that let in hot gases during re-entry -- outside officials said that with the Endeavour, NASA had taken steps far more elaborate and methodical in concluding that the craft was still safe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The comparison is night and day,'' said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, who served on the investigation board that looked into the Columbia disaster. He said he thought NASA had handled the Endeavour situation perfectly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers and officials with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will not know how accurate their analysis was or whether their decision to forgo a repair of a gouge in the Endeavour's underside was the correct one until the shuttle is back on Earth. The landing is scheduled for tomorrow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in maneuvers as simple as having the Endeavour perform a slow back flip to allow the crew aboard the International Space Station to photograph the shuttle's belly, to the use of a new laser scanner that showed the exact shape and size of the damage, NASA officials demonstrated the vast changes in procedures, attitude and culture of the agency since the Columbia accident four years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both missions, a piece of foam fell from the fuel tank, damaging the shuttle; both times, NASA officials expressed confidence that there would be no peril to spacecraft or crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this time, there is better reason to believe the assurances, outside experts say. For one, the piece of foam that hit the Endeavour was much smaller. And the accident, and the investigation board's call for a transformation in the safety culture of NASA, led to changes within the agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of the shuttle program retired and the mission management team leader transferred out of the shuttle program. New tools were developed to identify and analyze damage to the heat tiles, and senior managers began to make sure that dissenting voices could be heard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the Endeavour analysis overlooked some crucial detail, but that possibility is ''very, very slight,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''This episode is a good example of how the shuttle program has changed.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For both the Columbia and the Endeavour, the falling foam did not initially worry mission managers. The day after the Endeavour's liftoff, John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team, said that three small pieces of foam might have hit, but ''nothing significant.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What changed in the last four years is how NASA managers handle an event they do not consider serious. Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said he and managers listened to all of the data before making decisions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia's mission mangers never thought foam could cause catastrophic damage, and subsequent analysis was performed in a way to back up that conclusion. They quashed requests to have spy satellites take a closer look at the underbelly of the Columbia, so they never knew where the 1.67-pound piece of foam hit the orbiter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers dismissed, without detailed analysis, the possibility of damage to the leading edge of the Columbia's wings from foam.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reconstruction of the Columbia's debris showed that the foam, hurtling at 500 miles per hour, punched a hole 6 to 10 inches wide, which allowed hot gases to enter the wing during re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we uncovered was a relatively cavalier attitude to the damage of the thermal protection system,'' said G. Scott Hubbard, another member of the Columbia accident investigation board who is now a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That board found that a ''broken safety culture'' was as much a cause of the accident as the piece of insulating foam that struck the shuttle. John Allmen, program manager for shuttle support at the NASA Ames Research Center, said the pre-Columbia culture of NASA was sometimes intimidating for an engineer to bring up a concern. ''The general culture was that, 'What are you talking about? Prove to me it will fail,' '' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allmen said he still occasionally saw signs of the old culture, but that the top officials like N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, push it aside. ''He says, 'We're going to talk about it,' '' Mr. Allmen said. ''He keeps a very open and very detailed format for discussion and comments.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, mission managers knew the exact damage caused by the foam, which weighed one-third of an ounce. As the Endeavour approached the space station and performed the back flip, the station crew pinpointed a three-inch gouge on the right wing about four feet behind the landing gear door.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour astronauts then used an instrument boom attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to get a better look at the damage. A laser scanner in the boom, designed and built in response to the Columbia disaster to conduct inspections of the shuttle's underside, provided the exact shape and size of the gouge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then engineers performed detailed computer simulations to predict what the flow of hot gases during re-entry would do to the damaged area. The simulations indicated that the hottest gases would not flow to the bottom of the gouge and that the temperatures of the underlying aluminum skin would remain safe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That work was conducted by engineers from the Ames Research Center, who had adapted existing computer programs for the space shuttle, and then checked by other engineers from the Langley Research Center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers from the NASA research centers had not been involved during shuttle flights before the Columbia. About 100 people worked on the analysis of the Endeavour gouge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mission management meetings, engineers reviewed the data and all agreed that the gouge did not pose a threat. As an extra caution, engineers analyzed what would happen if they were wrong and some of the aluminum structure above the damaged area was lost. Even then the Endeavour would return safely, they concluded.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Hurricane Dean on a path far to the south of Houston and NASA's mission control center at the Johnson Space Center, there is less rush for the space shuttle Endeavour to land today, mission managers said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour is scheduled to set down this afternoon at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The first landing opportunity will be at 12:32 p.m. Eastern time. If thunderstorms or crosswinds interfere, there will be a follow-up opportunity at Kennedy on the next orbit. If weather prohibits a Florida landing, NASA will try again tomorrow and open Edwards Air Force Base in California as an alternate site.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During re-entry, there will still be an undercurrent of uncertainty over a small gouge in the heat tiles on the Endeavour's belly. Engineers conducted extensive computation and experiments to conclude that the gouge, caused by a small piece of foam that fell off the external fuel tank during liftoff, does not pose a peril to the astronauts. Mission managers decided not to try to send astronauts on a spacewalk to repair the gouge, because the risks outweighed the benefits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been a huge engineering effort'' to determine the safety of the craft, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., manager of the shuttle program, in a briefing yesterday with reporters. ''It's not a couple of graphs and a slide rule.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident has caused the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to re-examine the risk to the shuttles from bracket foam. That could lead to delays in missions currently scheduled for October and December, Mr. Hale said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can say with a high degree of confidence that Endeavour is safe to come home without needing a repair,'' he said. ''That is not to say we are entirely happy with the situation.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing was originally set for tomorrow, and if an approaching Hurricane Dean had shut down the Johnson Space Center that day, flight controllers could have flown to the Kennedy Space Center to handle the landing. But mission managers decided a better choice would be landing today, before the storm's arrival.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Dean was heading for the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, hundreds of miles away.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla., Aug. 21 -- The space shuttle Endeavour glided to a safe landing here Tuesday afternoon, apparently not much worse for wear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at the underside of the Endeavour appeared to validate the decision by mission managers not to try to repair a small but deep gouge, caused by a falling piece of foam, in two heat tiles on the underside of the right wing. The ultrahot gases streaming past the wing surface on re-entry burned a slightly larger scoop out of the gouged tiles, but the additional damage to the craft appeared to be limited.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference with the astronauts after the landing, Cmdr. Scott J. Kelly of the Navy, the Endeavour's commander, said the damage the gouge could have cause on re-entry ''crossed my mind for a moment, because I knew I was going to be asked about it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But really, Commander Kelly said, ''I didn't worry about it at all.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when he finally saw the damage after landing, he said, ''I was a little underwhelmed by the size of the gouge.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, NASA's administrator, who greeted the returning astronauts on the runway and also examined the damage close-up, said he saw some signs of heating and some erosion. ''But over all, you'd be hard put to tell it went through a re-entry,'' Dr. Griffin said at the news conference.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiles in that area will be removed for examination of the underlying aluminum structure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour returned ''in outstanding condition'' over all, said Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director at the Kennedy Space Center. ''Very few dings otherwise.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also returning to Earth was Barbara R. Morgan, the former teacher who was the backup to Christa McAuliffe to be NASA's first teacher-in-space. After the Challenger broke up on launching in 1986, killing Ms. McAuliffe and the other six astronauts aboard, Ms. Morgan returned to teaching before changing careers to become a full-time astronaut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference five hours after landing, Ms. Morgan, wearing her blue astronaut uniform and a red baseball cap, walked woozily to her seat. Asked about her future plans, she answered, ''My first plan is to get rid of the room spinning.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morgan, who in her educator role during the mission held video chats with schoolchildren, said she would look for opportunities to use her experience in space to inspire students. She also said she would not take back comments she made before the mission that teaching was more challenging than being an astronaut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing concluded a successful mission that lasted 12 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes and covered nearly 5.3 million miles in 201 orbits. During the visit to the International Space Station, Endeavour astronauts conducted four spacewalks to perform construction on the space station, which is now about 60 percent complete.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the falling foam had, in the end, little effect on the Endeavour, it may have repercussions for later flights. Engineers are analyzing whether modifications should be made to brackets that hold a fuel line on the external fuel tank. Ice that formed on the brackets after the tank was filled with ultracold liquid hydrogen and oxygen is believed to have caused a small piece of foam, about one-third of an ounce, to come loose 58 seconds into flight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has delayed attaching the solid rocket boosters to the external fuel tank for its next mission, with the shuttle Discovery, until a decision is made on what to do with the brackets. Mr. Leinbach said that there was a cushion of several days in the schedule of preparations for the launching of the Discovery, and that modifications like reducing the amount of foam on the brackets would take at most a couple of days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still pointed to Oct. 23 for our launch,'' Mr. Leinbach said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more likely to be affected is the subsequent mission, the launching of the Atlantis in early December, because the final preparations of attaching the orbiter to the external fuel tank cannot take place in NASA's giant Vehicle Assembly Building until the Discovery is moved out of the building to the launching pad.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin said he and William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for space operations, were inclined not to make changes, because the foam on the brackets was small and it was unclear whether changes would improve or worsen the situation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is also looking at possible changes to its countdown schedule. Following the loss of the Columbia in 2003 because of damage caused by falling foam, a one-hour ''hold'' was added to the countdown to allow inspectors to look for ice buildup. But the extra time may also allow more ice to form.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary mission on Tuesday was the Endeavour's safe return. At 11:05 a.m. Eastern time, Christopher J. Ferguson, an astronaut at the mission control center in Houston, radioed to the Endeavour crew, ''You are go for the de-orbit burn.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 11:25, over the Indian Ocean, the Endeavour fired its maneuvering thrusters for 3 minutes and 35 seconds. For the next hour, it dropped out of orbit toward Earth's atmosphere. The craft cruised over Costa Rica and Cuba, then over southern Florida, where the skies were blue with broken clouds and a steady breeze.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two quick, loud sonic booms thundered across the space center as the shuttle passed to the east. It then made a U-turn for its final approach from the north. In a picture-perfect landing, its rear tires touched the runway at 12:32 p.m., and the nose gently swiveled to the ground 13 seconds later. Slowed by a drag chute, it rolled to a stop about a minute later.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Congratulations, welcome home,'' Mr. Ferguson said to the Endeavour crew. ''You've given a new meaning to 'higher' education.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After turning millions of Internet users into virtual explorers of the world with  <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, the Internet search giant is now hoping to turn many of them into virtual stargazers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> is unveiling within  <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth today a new service called Sky that will allow users to view the skies as seen from Earth.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sky imagery was stitched together from more than one million photographs from scientific and academic sources, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Palomar Observatory at the California Institute of Technology and the NASA-financed Hubble.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What started two weeks ago as a routine space shuttle flight to service the international space station and let a teacher-astronaut inspire students from her perch in space turned into a bit of a nail-biter when the shuttle Endeavor suffered minor damage during liftoff. In the end, NASA handled the problem deftly, and the shuttle landed safely at the Kennedy Space Center yesterday. But it was a troubling reminder that the aging shuttles have some inherent defects that will always pose a risk as they limp toward retirement in 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the shattering forces of liftoff, a small piece of foam, weighing about one-third of an ounce, fell from the Endeavor's external fuel tank, bounced off a strut and hit the underside of the orbiter, where it gouged a small hole in the protective heat tiles. The hole was deep enough in one area to penetrate the entire thickness of the tiles. This was worrisome because the shuttle Columbia was destroyed in 2003 when a much bigger piece of foam fell off and gouged a hole in its wing, allowing hot gases to penetrate the vehicle during re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time the Endeavor had undergone repairs designed to limit the danger that foam debris of any significant size might shake off during liftoff. Unfortunately, it is apparently impossible to eliminate all such shedding. Thus, it is salutary that NASA had devised new techniques for analyzing and fixing the problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle performed a back flip so that astronauts aboard the space station could photograph its underside. Astronauts on the Endeavor used an instrument boom with a new laser scanner to measure the exact dimensions of the hole. Ground-based experiments tested what the heat of re-entry would do to the gouged tiles. And computer simulations verified that the underlying aluminum structure would not be damaged and require lengthy repairs. Had the gouge looked more threatening, the astronauts were prepared to attempt a space walk to repair the tiles, using techniques not fully tested.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will now look for quick fixes to reduce debris-shedding in the next few flights while it pursues a longer-term solution. But it has become increasingly clear that the shuttle's design, which puts a huge external fuel tank insulated with foam above a fragile spacecraft, is fundamentally flawed. This problem won't be solved until the shuttles are replaced with a new vehicle.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY   </div><div>448 words</div><div>25 August 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 -- NASA engineers think they have found the cause of and a remedy for foam falling from brackets on the space shuttle fuel tank like that which recently damaged the Endeavour heat shield tiles, agency officials said Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., manager of the shuttle program, said in a telephone news conference that X-ray tests of brackets that hold fuel lines on the next external propellant tank set to fly indicated microscopic cracks in a thin layer of foam atop the metal brackets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cracks in this special heat-resistant foam material, which is less than a half-inch thick, can lead to the lighter insulating foam above it coming off during the stresses of launching, Mr. Hale said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that we were able to identify the most likely cause with a simple test, X-raying the fittings, was heartening,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atop the underlying material, called superlightweight ablative foam core, is a layer of lighter insulating foam that prevents the formation of ice on the brackets holding a feed line that carries supercold liquid oxygen from the fuel tank to the engines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 58 seconds into the Endeavour launching on Aug. 8, a baseball-size piece of foam, perhaps mixed with ice or some of the underlying material, fell from a tank bracket and ricocheted off a metal strut into the shuttle belly. The foam damaged two heat-resistant ceramic tiles, forcing NASA engineers to study the problem extensively for days before deciding that the shuttle could land safely without trying to repair the gash with an emergency spacewalk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling foam is a serious threat to the shuttles and their crews. In 2003, the shuttle Columbia and its seven-member crew were lost while returning to Earth because of a hole in the wing caused by a chunk of foam during ascent. After that accident, NASA spent hundreds of millions of dollars to modify the fuel tank and greatly reduce foam loss at launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said technicians were to remove all the foam from the oxygen line brackets and reapply just the light insulating foam. Tests have shown that the underlying heat-resistant foam is not needed, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers from the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the fuel tanks are built, will arrive at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida this weekend to supervise the work. Mr. Hale said the foam modifications should take about nine days, finishing in time to use the tank to launch the shuttle Discovery on schedule on Oct. 23 for a mission to the International Space Station.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's that time of year on Uranus -- time for the semiannual ring-plane crossing, when the planet's ring system appears edge-on to observers on Earth. (Unlike the other planets, Uranus spins on its side, making for extreme changes in viewing angles.) The crossing allows telescopes to take pictures of the rings from the unlighted side, free from the glare that can obscure faint parts of them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a year on Uranus is equivalent to 84 Earth years, so this semiannual event is happening for the first time since the planet's rings were discovered, in 1977. And it's causing some rethinking about the rings and their stability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using infrared images taken by the 10-meter Keck II telescope in Hawaii, Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues report in Science Express, an online publication of the journal Science, that the rings have been going through some changes since they were first photographed in 1986 by Voyager 2.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2 showed rings that appeared to have dust embedded in them. The new images show a broad, faint cloud of material permeating the whole system, and also show that the rings do not extend as far out from the planet as they did in previous observations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers say the simplest explanation is that the dust distribution in the ring system has changed greatly over the past two decades. That isn't necessarily surprising, they say, since dust is subject to a lot of forces, but the scale of the changes is larger than anything observed before.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 -- An internal investigation has found no evidence of heavy drinking or drunkenness among astronauts before space missions, NASA officials said Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report summarizing the investigation, NASA's safety chief, the former astronaut Bryan D. O'Connor, said that although stories had circulated about astronauts abusing alcohol before missions, nothing was found to support them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Within the scope and limitations of this review, I was unable to verify any case in which an astronaut spaceflight crewmember was impaired on launch day,'' Mr. O'Connor wrote.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said he had found no evidence that managers had disregarded recommendations from flight surgeons or other crew members that an astronaut not be allowed to fly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, Mr. O'Connor recommended that NASA remind its employees to report, either openly or using one of several anonymous reporting systems the agency has in place, any threat to a flight's safety, including alcohol abuse. The report also recommended improvements in the oversight role of flight surgeons on launching day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am confident that there are reasonable safeguards in place to prevent an impaired crew member from boarding a spacecraft,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, NASA's administrator, told a news conference at agency headquarters that when an earlier report on astronaut health issues raised the question of possible alcohol abuse before missions, he took the issue seriously because it involved flight safety.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said he did not know where the rumors about astronauts drinking had come from, but he suggested that they were just another ''urban legend.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a Web site for urban legends and stories that are not true,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''This story is one of them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard E. McCurdy, an American University historian who is an expert on NASA management issues, said he was not surprised that the investigation did not turn up cases of astronauts being drunk before missions, a situation he called improbable. But Dr. McCurdy said the main good news for NASA was that there was no evidence that the advice of flight surgeons was being suppressed or ignored by space flight managers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA's post-Columbia tragedy management approach has been to investigate each concern, communicate, worry a bit and then make a decision,'' he said. ''This approach of openness is supposed to permeate the organization and not just apply to hardware. If NASA had found that the doctors' advice was being ignored in some cases, that would have indicated a serious problem.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top NASA officials asked Mr. O'Connor to investigate after a report by independent health experts on spacefarers' health released in July cited two unverified accounts of problem drinking before flights. The independent report was one of two ordered after the February arrest of a former astronaut, Capt. Lisa Marie Nowak of the Navy, who confronted a romantic rival in an Orlando International Airport parking lot. Captain Nowak now faces charges of assault and attempted kidnapping.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor said he had reviewed 20 years of shuttle flight history and 10 Russian Soyuz missions that included an American astronaut flying to the International Space Station. The review involved interviews with 90 astronauts, flight surgeons, NASA officials, flight technicians and staff members working in preflight crew quarters, as well as examination of more than 40,000 mission records, safety reports and other documents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor said no one interviewed expressed first-person knowledge of an astronaut's drinking heavily or being drunk before a flight. ''We didn't have one person to say they saw something,'' he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the alleged incidents involved a space shuttle astronaut that a colleague believed had had too much to drink. After the flight was delayed for mechanical reasons, the colleague supposedly alerted others to the problem as the crew was getting ready to fly back to Houston from Florida.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor focused on three missions from 1990 to 1995 that matched the scant details of the incident and said that he had spoken with at least two astronauts on each of those missions and their superiors and that no one had verified the claims.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other alleged incident involved an astronaut who was supposed to have gotten so drunk before flying in a Soyuz capsule that a flight surgeon sat in his room overnight because of concerns that his breathing might become impaired. No flight surgeon who covered Soyuz missions could verify the report, Mr. O'Connor said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said that as NASA administrator he was privy to certain information about the Soyuz mission that could not be discussed because of privacy restrictions. But he said he could state with certainty that the report about the astronaut was not true.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By ANDREW C. REVKIN   </div><div>495 words</div><div>31 August 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-eight scientists, engineers and other workers at one of NASA's top research centers filed suit in federal court yesterday challenging new security measures, including questions about loyalty and sexual orientation, that they say violate their constitutional rights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employees work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which is operated for NASA under contract by the California Institute of Technology. More than 5,000 workers at the laboratory are not government employees but work for the university or other contractors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To obtain new ID badges, NASA is requiring private workers at all installations to provide detailed background information and sign waivers allowing open-ended checks of past employment, questioning of former employers and neighbors, fingerprinting and other measures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civil servants have long had to undergo background checks. But in the suit -- filed in federal court in the Central District of California in Los Angeles against NASA, Caltech and the Commerce Department -- the plaintiffs say the new security checks required of nongovernment workers invade their privacy and violate other rights. The suit may grow to include other employees. A hearing was set for Sept. 24.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David R. Mould, an assistant administrator of NASA, said the review of the Pasadena laboratory employees was ''a standard background check for security clearance'' that applied equally across all executive-branch government agencies to people using certain information and equipment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to instructions provided by the propulsion laboratory, employees have until early October to submit security forms and schedule fingerprinting appointments or they could lose their jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, the laboratory had the open feel of an academic institution, but after the Sept. 11 attacks, there has been a security clampdown.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency, along with other government agencies, began developing a uniform identification system for workers at all federal sites under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, an executive order signed by President Bush in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees fighting the new rules have set up a Web site with the lawsuit and related documents at hspd12jpl.org. NASA has posted its background on the rules at hspd12.nasa.gov.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference and telephone conference call yesterday, several plaintiffs voiced frustrations with the procedures, which they described as overly aggressive given that they had all worked at the center for years, and in some cases four decades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By signing this supposed voluntary waiver I'm giving government investigators or whomever they designate the right to look into all areas of my private life,'' said Zareh Gorjian, who develops animation and other presentations related to space missions and has worked at the laboratory for 17 years. ''I was at J.P.L. during the cold war when we were fighting the Soviet Union, which had the power not only to end all life in the U.S. but the entire planet. We were able to defeat them without resorting to such intrusive tactics.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are old men now. That much is obvious from the tight camera shots. Nonetheless, it is hard to fathom: has it been 38 years since the first of them set foot on lunar soil?   </p>

Kennedy declared in 1962, ''before this decade is out.'' And so, on July 20, 1969, we did.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note the ''we.'' It is from one of the most powerful, lump-in-the-throat moments of this exceptional film. Michael Collins, who orbited the moon during the Apollo 11 mission while Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. took their lunar module down to the surface, said that after the flight, on the around-the-world tour that NASA sent them on, ''Wherever we went, people, instead of saying, 'Well, you Americans did it!' -- everywhere, they said, 'We did it! We, humankind, we, the human race, we, people, did it!' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His voice breaks slightly in the telling, and he says: ''I thought that was a wonderful thing. Ephemeral, but wonderful.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film, by the British director David Sington, has the backing of Ron Howard, the director of ''Apollo 13.'' It tells a story that has been told before, of course, in books and movies like the miniseries ''From the Earth to the Moon.'' The stories will be told again in the coming documentary, ''The Wonder of it All,'' which takes a similar, in-their-own-words approach, and in others that will surely arrive as the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing rolls around the summer after next.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts make tough reviewers -- they tend to prefer accuracy to drama -- but three Apollo astronauts interviewed for this article had praise for Mr. Sington's work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan L. Bean, an astronaut on Apollo 12, said reaching the moon ''has implications for young people, so they see what they can do, what their generation can do.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bean continued, ''This is a nice thing -- this is what our generation can do. What is your generation going to do? It's got to be better than this. Maybe it could be an inspiration.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison H. Schmitt, the geologist astronaut who made the last landing on the moon in 1972 with Eugene A. Cernan (and who later served a term in the United States Senate), said, ''I'm not a good judge of entertainment filming and programming; I would do all of that differently, and go broke.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Mr. Schmitt added, he would have liked to see a greater focus on the scientific benefits of the missions, including advances in geology and the rapid improvements in existing technologies like microelectronics that were pushed by the program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the film, the personalities of the less famous astronauts come through. Mr. Collins is funny and engaging, and Mr. Cernan is both precise and passionate. Charles M. Duke Jr. is eloquent in talking about how he felt being the capcom, or capsule communicator, on Apollo 11, as well as about his experiences on Apollo 16. Edgar Mitchell, who flew on Apollo 14, speaks with an almost mystical awe about his flight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts also talk about seeing ''the whole circle of the Earth'' at once, as Mr. Duke puts it. ''That jewel of Earth was just hung, up in the blackness of space,'' he says, holding his hands out, cupped, as if to cradle the sphere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the film appeal to those who did not experience the thrill of having watched the first steps on the moon live on television? Mr. Aldrin said he hoped the documentary would catch on. ''I am looking for things that are going to stimulate the American people'' to find the value in space exploration, he said, ''the inspirational, the innovational and just the human quest to discover.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the surviving moon walkers, only Mr. Armstrong declined to go on camera. That is not unusual, since he is known to avoid the spotlight. Mr. Sington exchanged a few e-mail messages with Mr. Armstrong, who explained, as Mr. Sington recalled, that ''if you want to talk to me about my personal experience, walking on the moon, you're missing the point.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, Mr. Armstrong had said, ''One small step for a man,'' not ''one small step for me,'' Mr. Sington recalled. ''He represents everybody.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, Mr. Sington said, he came to accept Mr. Armstrong's decision, and to have Mr. Armstrong's as the only face that is not updated. ''He's the one astronaut who stays young,'' he said. ''Somehow, to me, that's satisfying.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there in that, perhaps, a tiny bit of rationalization?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sington laughed. ''If he'd said, 'Yes, I'll do an interview,' I'd have been delighted,'' he said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIRTY years ago today, the Voyager 1 space probe -- a one-ton robotic craft whose long antennas make it look rather like a spider the size of a school bus -- was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a mission to reconnoiter Jupiter and Saturn. To succeed, Voyager would have to survive five years in the vacuum of space, where it would encounter cosmic rays, solar flares, the hurtling rocks and sand of the asteroid belt, and Jupiter's intense radiation bands.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The probe did all that, transmitting back reams of scientific data and memorable color photos: of the sputtering red and yellow volcanoes of Jupiter's moon Io; of the shimmering blue ice that shrouds Io's fellow satellite Europa, beneath which a liquid ocean is suspected to dwell; of Saturn's myriad rings and the murky mysteries of its orange satellite, Titan, whose hazy atmosphere is thought to approximate that of the early Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having accomplished its mission, Voyager 1 might have quietly retired. Instead it remains active to this day, faithfully calling home from nearly 10 billion miles away -- so great a distance that its radio signals, traveling at the speed of light, take more than 14 hours to reach Earth. From Voyager's perch, the Sun is just another star, south of Rigel in the constellation Orion, and the Sun's planets have faded to invisibility.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like its twin, Voyager 2 -- which dallied behind to examine the outer planets Uranus and Neptune and is departing the solar system on another trajectory -- Voyager 1 is approaching the edge of the solar system. That limit is defined by a teardrop-shaped bubble called the heliosphere, where the solar wind (particles blown off the Sun's outer atmosphere) comes to a halt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all continues to go well, Voyager should pierce the heliosphere's outer skin by around 2015. It will then depart into the void of interstellar space, where it is destined to wander among the stars forever.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mindful of this mind-boggling fact, the astronomers Carl Sagan and Frank Drake persuaded NASA to attach a gold-plated phonograph record to each of the Voyager spacecraft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Containing photographs, natural sounds of Earth and 90 minutes of music from all over our world, the record was intended to preserve something of human culture beyond what an intelligent extraterrestrial, encountering the craft at some far-distant time and place, might infer from the spacecraft itself.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information etched into the grooves of the Voyager record is expected to last at least one billion years. That's a long time: A billion years ago, life on Earth was first venturing forth from the seas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past three decades, the gold record has become an article of international curiosity. Spirited discussions continue about what we might do differently if we were making it today. (Having produced the record, I answer that I wouldn't change much.) At the time, though, the record almost didn't make it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials, worried that Congress would ridicule the record as a waste of public money, had tried to play it down. Press-release photos of the spacecraft almost invariably showed the side opposite to where the record was bolted on, literally hiding it from view.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after the record was completed, NASA rejected it on technical grounds. Late one night in a New York sound studio, when we'd finished cutting the master, I inscribed the words, ''To the makers of music -- all worlds, all times,'' in the ''takeout grooves'' next to the label. (The Voyager record is a metal version of the 33 1/3 vinyl records of the day, recorded at half-speed to double its data content. Etching an inscription between the takeout grooves was a trope I'd picked up from John Lennon.) A NASA quality-control officer checked the record against specifications and found that while the record's size, weight, composition and magnetic properties were all in order, its blueprints made no provision for an inscription.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the record was rejected as a nonstandard part, and the space agency prepared to replace it with a blank disc. Sagan had to persuade the NASA administrator to sign a waiver before the record could fly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty thousand years will elapse before Voyager 1, departing the realm of the Sun at a speed of 38,000 miles per hour, passes anywhere near another star. (It will drift within 1.7 light years of a dim bulb called AC+79 3888.) And 358,000 years will elapse before Voyager 2 approaches the bright star Sirius.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out there, our concepts of velocity become provincial. The stars are moving, too, in gigantic orbits around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Voyager, a toy boat on this dark sea, will not so much approach Sirius as watch it sail by, bobbing in its mighty wake.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contemplation of Voyager's billion-year future among the stars may make us feel small and the span of our history seem insignificant. Yet the very existence of the two spacecraft and the gold records they carry suggests that there is something in the human spirit able to confront vast sweeps of space and time that we can only dimly comprehend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If some recoil from the brink of space, others find it liberating. Our perspective was aptly expressed by the 18th-century science writer Bernard de Fontenelle, in his fictional dialogue ''A Plurality of Worlds.'' ''You have made the universe so large that I know not where I am, or what will become of me,'' complains a lovely young marquise whom Fontenelle is tutoring. ''I protest it is dreadful.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dreadful, Madam?'' Fontenelle replies. ''For my part, I am very easy about it.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A film review in Weekend on Friday about the documentary ''In the Shadow of the Moon'' misidentified one of the Apollo flights that took men close to the moon before Apollo 11 landed there. In addition to Apollo 10, it was Apollo 8 -- not 9 -- that went close to the moon. (Apollo 9 orbited the Earth).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Mon Sep 10 2007    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Apollo 11 astronauts toured the world after their July 1969 moon landing, recalls Mike Collins, the pilot of the mission's command module, he heard the phrase ''We did it'' everywhere they went. The ''we,'' he remembers in David Sington's documentary ''In the Shadow of the Moon,'' didn't refer to Americans, or to any nationality, but to the human race. Millions around the world who had watched on television as men walked on the moon for the first time felt that they had participated in a great adventure that ennobled the species.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Collins's recollections make you swell with vicarious pride, they may also make you shudder. When was the last time the wonders of technology received such wholehearted endorsement? If today's world is even more strife-torn than the world of 1969, when the Vietnam War was raging, one reason may be that the same technology that produced Apollo 11 has since come under a cloud.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good vibes are gone. The tone of international political discourse has toughened, and the United States is increasingly viewed as an arrogant, dangerous superpower. The concept of a cooperative multinational ''we,'' working together for world peace, with America leading the way, is almost as quaint as the cozy concept of ''the global village.'' The planet that looked so pretty to Mr. Collins from 240,000 miles away is more fragile than we realized.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why ''In the Shadow of the Moon'' is such a morale booster. The power of its archival images hasn't diminished with familiarity. There is Earth, spinning in space, a blue and green paradise ringed with clouds. And there is the moon's surface, up close and forbidding, with shadowy craters like pockmarks: a place of absolute desolation. Yes, we did it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Collins, who offers his memories in a tone devoid of grandiosity, is the most articulate of the 10 astronauts from various Apollo missions interviewed in the film. While Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11's lunar module pilot, and Neil Armstrong, its overall commander, walked on the moon, Mr. Collins never set foot on it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His regrets seem minimal. In down-to-earth language he describes the same feelings of awe and humility that millions back on Earth experienced when looking at the pictures relayed from afar. Putting his thumb in front of his face, he marvels, he could make the Earth disappear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Aldrin's observations aren't as indelible, while those of the notoriously private Mr. Armstrong, who refused to participate in the film, are secondhand. Mr. Collins and Mr. Aldrin both express awe at Mr. Armstrong's coolness under pressure and his ability to come up with the perfect phrase -- ''that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind'' -- when the occasion demanded. But Mr. Armstrong's absence leaves the movie with a hole. A grainy vintage television excerpt of his parents on the game show ''I've Got a Secret'' doesn't begin to fill the gap.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the story of Apollo 11 the documentary spins a sketchy history of the NASA space program, beginning with its cold war origins. It includes President John F. Kennedy's famous 1961 speech to Congress declaring his goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade and bringing him safely back to earth. It recalls how the Apollo program nearly ended in January 1967 when a flash fire erupted on Apollo 1 while it was on the launch pad during a simulated countdown, killing three astronauts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a manned mission finally left Earth's orbit in December 1968 and circled the moon, President Kennedy's goal suddenly seemed attainable. Apollo 9 and 10 took men close to the moon's surface, and on July 20, 1969, the dream was finally realized. A creepy footnote is an excerpt from a sad television speech prepared for President Nixon to deliver should the Apollo 11 mission fail.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Threaded through the film are fragments of taped interviews with eight other Apollo astronauts: Alan Bean, Gene Cernan, Charlie Duke, Jim Lovell, Edgar Mitchell, Harrison Schmitt, Dave Scott and John Young. These snippets appear almost randomly, in no particular order, and it is impossible to keep track of who's who. Cumulatively, however, they create a group portrait of explorers with ''the right stuff'': men with a much higher resistance to fear than average.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Collins remembers the intense physical sensations that he experienced during the Apollo 11 mission but that he never associated with panic. What could have been more terrifying than the moment when the module's computer was found to be overloaded, just as Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin were about to touch down? But Mr. Armstrong calmly went about improvising a solution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was a lack of fear, there were a thousand little worries. Through every phase Mr. Collins fretted about the details that had to mesh for the mission to be successful. But he never feared for his life. That, in a nutshell, is the right stuff.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among these are nine faint ones discovered recently by the Hubble Space Telescope.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars rover Opportunity will finally enter a half-mile-wide crater today, after two months besieged by a giant dust storm that blocked the sun and sapped the vehicle's batteries. The Opportunity has been sitting at the rim of Victoria Crater, which promises to give scientists a deeper, more intriguing look into Mars's geological past. But then the dust storm engulfed much of the planet, and it appeared that the rover might exhaust its power and die. With Martian skies clearing, mission controllers gave the go-ahead for the Opportunity to do a ''toe dip,'' to drive over the crater lip and three yards down the crater's 20-degree slope before backing out. If that goes well, then it will re-enter and begin its exploration.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is new hope that Earth, if not the life on it, might survive an apocalypse five billion years from now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is when, scientists say, the Sun will run out of hydrogen fuel and swell temporarily more than 100 times in diameter into a so-called red giant, swallowing Mercury and Venus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are announcing that they have discovered a planet that seems to have survived the puffing up of its home star, suggesting there is some hope that Earth could survive the aging and swelling of the Sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is a gas giant at least three times as massive as Jupiter. It orbits about 150 million miles from a faint star in Pegasus known as V 391 Pegasi. But before that star blew up as a red giant and lost half its mass, the planet must have been about as far from its star as Earth is from the Sun -- about 90 million miles -- according to calculations by an international team of astronomers led by Roberto Silvotti of the Observatorio Astronomico di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Silvotti said the results showed that a planet at Earth's distance ''can survive'' a red giant, and he said he hoped the discovery would prompt more searches.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With some statistics and new detailed models, we will be able to say something more even to the destiny of our Earth (which, as we all know, has much more urgent problems by the way),'' he said via e-mail.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Silvotti and his colleagues reported their results today in Nature.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an accompanying commentary, Jonathan Fortney of NASA's Ames Research Center in California wrote, ''This system allows us to start examining what will happen to planets around stars such as our own Sun as they too evolve and grow old.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star V 391 Pegasi is about 4,500 light years from Earth and is about half as massive as the Sun, burning helium into carbon. It will eventually sigh off another shell of gas and settle into eternal senescence as a white dwarf.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the star's pulsations cause it to brighten and dim every six minutes. After studying the star for seven years, Dr. Silvotti and his colleagues were able to discern subtle modulations in the six-minute cycle, suggesting that the star was being tugged to and fro over a three-year period by a massive planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Essentially, the observers are using the star as a clock, as if it were a G.P.S. satellite moving around the planet,'' said Fred Rasio of Northwestern University, who was not involved in the research.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time that a pulsing star has been used as such a clock. In 1992, astronomers using the same technique detected a pair of planets (or their corpses) circling the pulsar PSR1257+12. And only yesterday, X-ray astronomers from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had detected the remains of a star that radiation had whittled down to planetary mass circling a pulsar in the constellation Sagittarius. Those systems have probably endured supernova explosions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pegasus planet has had to survive less lethal conditions, although it must have had a bumpy ride over its estimated 10 billion years of existence. Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington said, ''Stellar evolution can be a wild ride for a planet that is trying to survive, especially inner planets like Earth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When our own Sun begins to graduate from a hydrogen-burning main sequence star to a red giant, two effects will compete, the astronomers said. As the Sun blows off mass to conserve angular momentum, Earth will retreat to a more distant, safer orbit. At the same time, tidal forces between Earth and the expanding star will try to drag the planet inward, where it could be engulfed. The latter effect, in particular, is difficult to compute.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute said of the inner planets, ''Earth's fate is actually the most uncertain because it is at the border line between being engulfed and surviving.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A particularly dangerous time for Earth, Dr. Silvotti said, would be at the end of the red giant phase when the Sun's helium ignites in an explosive flash. In the case of V 391 Pegasi, that explosion sent a large fraction of the star's mass flying outward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is another reason why the survival of a planet in a relatively close orbit is not trivial,'' he said.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>839 words</div><div>14 September 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group whose $10 million prize spurred privately financed rocketeers to send a small piloted craft to the cusp of space in 2004 has issued a new challenge: an unmanned moon shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the audacious new contest comes a much bigger prize: up to $25 million, paid for by <span class="companylink">Google</span>, the ubiquitous Internet company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The '' <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize'' was announced yesterday in Los Angeles at the Wired magazine's NextFest. The contest calls for entrants to land a rover on the moon that will be able to travel at least 550 yards and send high-resolution video, still images and other data back home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X Prize Foundation saw the new contest as one of ''the grand challenges of our time that we can use to move people forward,'' said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis, chairman and C.E.O. of the foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prize for reaching the moon and completing the basic tasks of roving and sending video and data will bring the winner $20 million, according to the contest rules. An additional $5 million would be awarded for other tasks that include roving more than 5,500 yards or sending back images of artifacts like lunar landers from the Apollo program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carnegie Mellon University immediately announced that a roboticist on its faculty, William L. Whittaker, would be pulling together a team to seek the prize. Why would anyone sign up for a challenge that will almost certainly cost more than the prize will bring? John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said: ''There are a variety of reasons to do it, including ego gratification, including loss-leader reputation building, including a fascination with doing things in space. I don't think they're driven by the amount of the prize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon said the goal was realistic once a launch vehicle is obtained. ''Russia and the U.S. did that sort of thing 40 years ago,'' he said. ''The technologies aren't easy, but with all the experience in industrial robots and sensor devices, I don't see any reason why you couldn't put together a robotic machine that could meet these requirements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $20 million grand prize will be available until Dec. 31, 2012, and then will drop to $15 million for two years. The contest would be likely to end after that time, though <span class="companylink">Google</span> and the foundation would be able to extend it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new contest follows the path of the original Ansari X Prize, which was won by SpaceShipOne, a manned spacecraft designed by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites and financed by Paul Allen, a co-founder of <span class="companylink">Microsoft.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prize was paid for through a special insurance policy secured by Anousheh Ansari, a telecommunications entrepreneur in Texas and a board member of the X Prize Foundation who has since orbited the Earth aboard the International Space Station. Mr. Rutan is designing a second generation spacecraft called SpaceShipTwo that will be used by Sir Richard Branson's space tourism company, Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new X Prize, Dr. Diamandis said, grew out of research performed last year for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a contest that the space agency would sponsor. The research suggested that six or seven contenders could be expected to try for the prize, but NASA ultimately backed away from financing the project, Dr. Diamandis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in March, Dr. Diamandis pitched the idea to <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s co-founder, Larry Page, who sits on the board of the X Prize foundation. ''Sounds like a lot of fun,'' he told Dr. Diamandis. The multimillion-dollar project, Mr. Page said, would be ''doable,'' but his <span class="companylink">Google</span> co-founder, Sergey Brin, would have to sign on as well. This also happened quickly, Dr. Diamandis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has announced plans to return astronauts to the moon as early as 2020. But without the need to keep humans alive or to make a return trip, the X Prize trips would be comparatively simpler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of successful entrepreneurs from the world of computing and the Internet, like Mr. Allen, have pursued childhood fascination with space with efforts to create real spacecraft. Elon Musk, a founder of PayPal, has developed rockets through his company, Space Exploration Technologies, and Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon .com, is developing rockets at a facility he owns in West Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger D. Launius, curator at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, expressed enthusiasm for the new competition, which he said ''might unleash a kind of furor of innovation'' and heighten interest in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly a challenge that is worthy,'' Mr. Launius said. But he also expressed worries that the robotic adventurers would head to the site of the Apollo 11 landing, a prospect he said was troubling since ''the last thing I want to see happen is to see Tranquility Base disturbed.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know, when we stop to think about it, that the Earth is in fact a planet of rock and water, with an existence quite separate from our own. But we don't believe it in our bones. Perhaps the best proof is the discovery of a planet orbiting a star called V 391 Pegasi, some 4,500 light years from us.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That planet appears to have survived the transformation of its sun into a red giant. That is the very fate predicted for our own Sun some five billion years from now, when it will swell to a size that engulfs the orbits of Mercury and Venus. But to suggest that Earth might survive the Sun's senescence is to say something about this lump of rock we live on, not our species. And yet we have trouble reading it that way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of us have come to terms with the notion that the Sun will swell catastrophically -- some day. Five billion years is roughly 25,000 times longer than Homo sapiens have lived.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, once upon a time, even to talk about that distant catastrophe was to assume that it would somehow be a human event. You may remember learning about Earth's eventual fate with a sinking feeling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grimmer realization of recent decades -- a time of looming man-made cataclysms -- is that we do not live in geological or astronomical time. We live in ethical and cultural time, that is, human time. The sensible questions are how to live that time to the fullest and how to stave off a premature ending.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA announced new details yesterday about its plans for a Moon base that included a pair of small, pressurized rovers with a range of nearly 600 miles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency plans to return astronauts to the Moon around 2020. Agency officials first described proposals last December for a polar lunar base powered by near constant sunlight on solar panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier proposals to carry small habitation modules to the Moon in stages might be supplanted by a proposal that would heave a single large module to the Moon on an unmanned cargo ship, Doug Cooke, the NASA official leading the lunar study group, said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rover would not be much larger than the buggies the Apollo astronauts drove, but would be pressurized so that astronauts could drive in shirt sleeves and be protected from radiation -- probably by a layer of water in the rover's body, said Geoff Yoder, an official working on the lunar plans. To explore on foot, astronauts would put on spacesuits and leave the vehicle, Mr. Yoder said. The cost? ''More than a Ferrari,'' he joked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists said they had also discussed nuclear energy as a power supply for the habitat, since that might be necessary for building a successful encampment on Mars. But, Mr. Cooke said, the initial power source for the lunar base ''should be solar.'' They have also discussed making the lunar lander and habitat mobile so that the base could be moved for exploration of other areas in what is being called ''super sortie'' mode, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The updated plans were discussed at a conference of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics on Thursday in Long Beach, Calif.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the relics of the American space program, a few have achieved iconic status -- John Glenn's Mercury capsule, the Apollo 11 command module, rocks from the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the Airstream trailer rediscovered last spring at a fish farm in Alabama.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surplus trailer had most recently been used as housing by the Fish and Wildlife Service. But in late 1969, it was temporary quarters for the Apollo 12 crew on their return from the Moon. Worried that astronauts might pick up a lunar microbe and transmit it to earthlings, NASA outfitted the trailer with blowers and filters, and the astronauts remained in it for a few days until receiving a clean bill of health.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Airstream is being restored and will be on display beginning in January at the United States Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two other surviving M.Q.F.'s, as the initial-happy agency called the mobile quarantine facilities, including one from Apollo 11 at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport in Virginia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living quarters of a different sort can be found in the Wisconsin Dells, where a spare core module of the Mir space station is on exhibition at the Tommy Bartlett Exploratory. The 43-foot-long module, one of several built by the Russian space agency, was bought from a Moscow museum a decade ago by Mr. Bartlett, a Midwestern entrepreneur best known for his waterskiing thrill show, which can be seen next door.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the world's largest test stands can be viewed at the Stennis Space Center in western Mississippi. It is a 400-foot-tall structure where engineers test fired the huge engines used to power the Saturn V Moon rocket. A 39-foot-thick concrete anchor prevented the test structure itself from flying into orbit. The test stand is viewable from a visitors' center, and because rocket testing continues there, it is sometimes possible to watch an actual test.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stennis center is all about engines. To see an actual rocket, one of the best places is a museum dedicated to the arms race, not the space race. The Titan Missile Museum, a preserved cold war complex south of Tucson, has a Titan II missile visitors can practically touch. This one was part of a program to hurl nuclear warheads at the Soviet Union. But the same rockets were used to hurl the Gemini astronauts into space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all space relics are so large or so serious. One of the oddest is the hybrid lunar scoop and 6 iron that Alan B. Shepard Jr. used to hit a golf ball on the Moon. It is the property of the United States Golf Association and is now on display at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shepard was also the first American in space, riding a Redstone rocket on a suborbital flight in May 1961. He was preceded five months earlier by Ham, a chimpanzee who was the first hominid in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ham's ride was no walk in the park. His capsule landed hundreds of miles off target, and a valve failure caused it to become almost fully depressurized in flight. They were the kinds of mishaps that later made the Apollo 13 crew famous. No one ever made a blockbuster movie about Ham, who died in 1983 at age 27. But those who want to pay him homage can visit his grave at the New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tang, no matter what you've heard, was not an invention of the space program. Neither were Teflon or Velcro.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that astronauts drank Tang, the orange-flavored breakfast drink developed by General Foods, in orbit; that Teflon is, in fact, a component of spacesuits and heat shields; and that Velcro is a handy way of keeping things from floating away in zero gravity. But all three products were invented for earthbound use long before NASA sent them into space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So to what extent has the space program transformed modern life and contributed to America's prosperity?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts note some fundamental contributions. The satellites that began beaming television signals instantaneously around the globe, peering intently at developing hurricanes and studying the planet's changing climate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your life would be fundamentally different if we didn't have those things,'' said Roger D. Launius, a space historian at the Smithsonian Institution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other spinoffs are harder to identify, and their economic effects are debatable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnetic resonance imaging machines were not invented by NASA, but software algorithms written to sharpen the images sent back from the Moon were used by Landsat satellites for pictures of Earth and then adapted by medical researchers to produce clearer M.R.I. images.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various studies have said that what NASA spends on the space program -- in 2007, its budget was $16.8 billion, about 15 cents a day for each American or 0.7 percent of the overall federal budget -- is at least tripled in returns to the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doubters might argue that something like the image-processing algorithms used in M.R.I.'s would have been written anyway, even without NASA's help.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Launius said spinoffs should not be viewed as a primary justification for the space program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Spinoffs are serendipity to the mission that NASA is seeking to accomplish,'' he said. ''Trying to justify the program on the basis of serendipity is, I think, kind of misplaced.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech this year, Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, made a similar argument, adding that the grocery and hardware stores are the wrong places to look for space spinoffs, anyway.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real spinoffs are at a higher level,'' Mr. Griffin said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any company that seeks to build a rocket or satellite component ''or who even wants to supply nuts, bots and screws to the space industry,'' he said, ''must work to a higher level of precision than human beings had to do before the space industry came along.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And that fact absolutely resonates through our entire industrial base. What is the value of that? I can't calculate it, but I know it's there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellites wobble, so the video they take can be jittery. NASA scientists wrote software to bring out the details. That software helped the F.B.I. investigate the 1996 Olympic bombing in Atlanta by clarifying nighttime video taken by a bystander. The multitude of satellites -- observing weather, conveying television, sending global positioning signals -- are the most direct influence of space technology on everyday life. But other space spinoffs have also found practical uses on Earth. At the Kennedy Space Center, the humid, salty air of the Florida coast corrodes the launching pads, so NASA developed a protective coating. That same material was applied to the interior framework of the Statue of Liberty during its renovation. Developed to simulate microgravity conditions, the bioreactor cultivates cells and may enable the growing of tissues and organs for transplants. For many biologists, the bioreactor may replace the venerable Petri dish.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, during an otherwise routine budget hearing, Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, warned members of Congress that China's aggressive space program could ''easily'' put humans on the Moon before American astronauts are able return to the lunar surface under the space agency's proposed Moon-Mars project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The China card can be a strong selling point on Capitol Hill, and Mr. Griffin, trying to finance an ambitious human spaceflight program with Mars as the ultimate goal, plays it as well as anyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is America's great space-age paranoia: that the United States has frittered away 35 years of space superiority, and a new generation of rivals is about to shove it into second place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is the challenger du jour. It became the third nation to send a human into space in 2003, it put a two-man crew in orbit in 2005 and it plans to send an unmanned orbiter to the Moon this year. It plans to launch three astronauts and conduct its first spacewalk in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, China's military destroyed one of its own derelict satellites with a guided missile in a provocative demonstration of ballistic prowess. Although it is unclear what the Chinese intended, the test left no doubt that space hardware -- everything from crucial navigation and communication assets to secret spy satellites -- is a very soft target. And no one has more space hardware than the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its achievements, experts say, China is decades away from developing the full array of space expertise and infrastructure that allows the United States to simultaneously launch astronauts, send unmanned craft to explore outer planets, take spectacular pictures from orbiting telescopes and profile the eye of a hurricane. ''We are leagues ahead of everyone else, and it's going to take a lot of time, effort and money to counter that superiority,'' said Joan Johnson-Freese, chairwoman of the Department of National Security Studies at the Naval War College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, what China can do is ''match, compete with or even supplant'' the United States ''in piecemeal ways,'' said Eric Hagt, head of the China program at the independent World Security Institute. By putting humans in space, China wins significant prestige, Mr. Hagt said. Putting their own man on the Moon before the United States can return would put the Chinese first in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is not the only player with space aspirations. India is developing a human spaceflight program and hopes to have astronauts in orbit by 2014. Europe and Japan, which routinely fly astronauts aboard the space shuttle, also have highly developed space science programs. Japan's innovative mission to orbit the asteroid Itokawa has produced a journal's worth of research papers, and next year the European Space Agency expects to bring its 30-satellite Galileo navigation network online as an alternative to the Global Positioning System in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia, once America's only rival in space, has been out of the game since the breakup of the Soviet Union. But the Russians these days are flush with petrodollars and looking for ways to reassert their power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Russia has the capabilities, the big industrial base, the trained cadre of people and the ability to launch in all kinds of weather,'' said John Logsdon, a space historian at George Washington University. ''It has a relatively unambitious space plan for the next few years, but that could change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty years into the space age, human spaceflight and space science remain the most traditional measures of prestige and accomplishment, but space has also become a lucrative business and a new territory for military competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big money is still in building spacecraft for governments, and the major aerospace companies worldwide, like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, Lockheed, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, and RKK Energia, a Russian company, focus on that. Building commercial satellites is a much more modest undertaking. Since 2004, the world has produced 80 of them; China has built 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space's other cottage industry is a Russian monopoly: running a ferry service to the International Space Station with its venerable Soyuz spacecraft. Since 2001, five well-heeled space tourists have paid $20 million apiece or more to visit the station. Soyuz also carried American astronauts to the station after the 2003 Columbia accident grounded the space shuttle fleet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With plans for the shuttle to be retired in 2010, the United States is developing new launching vehicles capable of returning astronauts to the Moon and eventually taking them to Mars. That is the kind of big, high-risk idea that has always defined space leadership, and that is where China is competing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China launched its first satellite in 1970, but its space program languished during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and internal power struggles. Estranged from both the Soviet Union and the United States, China learned to fend for itself. In 2003, a Long March rocket carried Lt. Col. Yang Liwei aboard the Shenzhou V spacecraft. Colonel Yang returned safely to Earth after 14 orbits and became a national hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese share little information about their programs, but Zhang Oinwei, who heads construction of the Shenzhou spacecraft, said the human space flight program spent about $2.3 billion in the years leading up to Colonel Yang's flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Shenzhou VI, carrying two Chinese army colonels, orbited Earth for five days. Shenzhou VII, scheduled for launching in 2008, will carry three crew members who will attempt China's first spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shenzhou (it means ''magic vessel'') spacecraft are patterned after the Soyuz but are slightly larger. China has said that its goal is to use the Shenzhou to develop orbiting skills and technology and eventually to build a small space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Chinese have not formally announced plans to send humans to the Moon, the Shenzhou flights, coupled with plans for science missions to orbit the Moon, put robotic rovers on the lunar surface and return soil samples to Earth show that China has read the Apollo playbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin of NASA has described the Shenzhou program as having reached the Gemini stage, recalling the two-man American flights in the mid-1960s that prepared astronauts for the Apollo missions. He told Congress in March that it would ''easily be possible'' for the Chinese to mount a lunar mission within a decade. If so, China could put humans on the Moon by 2018, a year earlier than the United States, under current American budget projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States, worried about China's military ambitions, has regarded the Chinese space program warily in recent years, imposing export restrictions on commercial technologies that might also have military uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Griffin accepted an invitation from Chinese officials to tour their space facilities in the hope of broadening ties. After cordial talks and meetings with civilian space scientists and engineers, however, Mr. Griffin cut his visit short when the military refused to let him visit the human spaceflight training facilities at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we are to conduct human space flight activity together, we have to have a great degree of trust, a great degree of sharing, a great degree of openness,'' Mr. Griffin told reporters at the end of his trip. ''Transparency and openness mean being able to see and touch and ask questions and get answers, and China and the U.S. are not at that point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite China's achievements and aspirations, there is no evidence that the Chinese can soon compete with the United States in technical skill or space infrastructure. ''This is about political will,'' said Dr. Johnson-Freese of the Naval War College. ''They are challenging what we are willing to do, or willing to pay for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress seems solidly allied with Mr. Griffin on the need to finance the Moon-Mars project, but the Bush administration's insistence on paying for the program without increasing NASA's overall budget has put some spaceflight advocates on edge. At the same time, scientists interested in robotic missions and space research worry that Mr. Griffin's interest in spaceflight will shortchange those programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those concerned about China, however, there was plenty to worry about after the Chinese shot down a Fengyun-1C weather satellite in January. The destruction of the satellite created more than 900 new trackable pieces of debris, increasing by 10 percent the amount of hazardous space junk circling Earth. China made matters worse by refusing for 12 days to acknowledge responsibility for the satellite's destruction, which was viewed by most of the rest of the world as pure folly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western analysts have offered several reasons for China's wanting to shoot down the satellite. China may have wanted to test its ability to destroy enemy satellites in a confrontation over Taiwan; it may have wanted to show the United States how vulnerable satellites are and encourage participation in talks aimed at banning weapons in space; or, it may have just been a long-scheduled test that the military conducted without informing the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some considered the incident as evidence of another cold war rivalry. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, long a space program advocate, said the Chinese ''are already in a space race with us, and we haven't recognized it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others say the time is ripe to sit down with the Chinese and co-opt them. Dr. Johnson-Freese said the United States should encourage China to put more satellites in space, to ''make them as dependent on space assets as we are,'' and just as vulnerable.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty years of spaceflight have taken people to the Moon and have sent unmanned vehicles zipping to the fringes of the solar system. What could the next 50 years bring?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much more, or potentially not much more. Government-financed space travel could stall in the face of America's growing aversion to risk and a kind of orbital ennui. NASA has, after all, already tried for more than a decade to develop follow-on vehicles to the flawed space shuttle and is in the process of trying again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private enterprise is stepping up, but the industry is still fragile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said in an interview that he was confident of one thing for the foreseeable future: ''We're going to have a space program.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, all bets are off.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The one thing of which we can be certain,'' Mr. Griffin wrote in a recent essay on the Web site of the magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology, ''is that in trying to envision the world of 2057, two generations in the future, we will be wrong.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts in government, industry and science agree, however, that these three broad trends will shape the coming decades in space:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has embarked on a program to return to the Moon by 2020, not just for what some critics call ''flags and footprints,'' but also for a lasting presence with scientific research and preparation for expeditions to asteroids and, eventually, Mars. The space shuttle program is being wound down by 2010 to create the next generation of vehicles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other nations, notably Russia and China, have ambitious plans and could spur a space race like the one that sent Americans to the Moon. ''It took Sputnik for us to recognize what the Soviet Union was up to,'' said Harrison H. Schmitt, who flew the last mission to the Moon, in 1972. ''I don't know what it will take this time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private enterprise is moving ahead, beginning with space tourism and, later, transport services for NASA and other governments to outposts like the International Space Station. Beyond that, ventures could include mining on asteroids and manufacturing drugs in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, director of the space policy institute at George Washington University, says a big question has yet to be answered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the level of government, I think we're still struggling as to why we're sending people to space,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''It's a decent question, and I think it's an unanswered question.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves the manned space program at a precarious point, he said, adding: ''If the current proposals to restart human exploration fail politically, indeed, the human space flight endeavor conducted under government auspices might well lose its momentum. I obviously hope that doesn't happen. But it's far from a slam dunk that we're going back to the Moon and on to Mars.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs say they have the answer -- money. Peter Diamandis, a founder of the Ansari X Prize, the $10 million competition to put a pilot in space without government financing, said that with all the energy and minerals to be found there ''the first trillionaires are going to be made in space.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next 50 years, Mr. Diamandis said, ''economic engines,'' not political ones, will push the space frontier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon is skeptical. ''There are a variety of alluring prospects that have been around almost since the start of the last 50 years that are still there as alluring prospects,'' he said. ''And we are not further along in knowing whether they can be turned into reality or not.'' The continued reliance on chemical rockets, for example, limits the weight that can be taken into space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet much has changed in the last 50 years that could lay the foundation for the next 50. A new generation of ultrawealthy entrepreneurs who grew up with a space fascination are pouring personal fortunes into making space businesses real.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul G. Allen, a founder of  <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, paid for SpaceShipOne, the tiny craft that won the X Prize in 2004. Elon Musk, a founder of PayPal, is developing rockets through his company, Space Exploration Technologies, and has NASA financing that could lead to his spacecraft's carrying people and supplies to the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder of  <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, is developing rockets at a site he owns in western Texas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Bigelow, who made his fortune in hotels, is developing a space transportation system and a space station that could be used as an orbiting hotel or a research base.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official charged with regulating commercial spaceflight, Patricia Grace Smith of the Federal Aviation Administration, said in an interview, ''When I look out 50 years from now, I fully expect that we will have actual, operational spaceports'' that are commercially operated and owned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the dusty, sprawling Mojave Air and Space Port in California, dreamers and pragmatists join in planning the future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Greason, the founder of Xcor Aerospace, one of several rocket companies there, said his industry was ready to talk big again after years of having to shake off the pixie dust of science fiction. ''We had to stop focusing on the grand and glorious future,'' he said, ''because otherwise, people weren't going to take us seriously as a business. We very consciously turned the vision thing off.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're making progress on real businesses that turn profits,'' he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies are already in the game. Mr. Greason's neighbor, Scaled Composites, is working on a successor vehicle to its SpaceShipOne.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic, which will buy the vehicles, has a long list of potential space tourists.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Esther Dyson, a longtime technology guru who is encouraging investment in space, said the development of rocket businesses paralleled the early days of personal computing and the Internet. Early government financing created technologies whose use was largely limited to government and academia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So eventually these commercial types came in, and suddenly a whole lot of revenue came in,'' she said. ''It benefited the research types, as well as the commercial types. And it created an infrastructure for the public.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That led, in turn, to today's  <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Netscape,  <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, ''all these wonderful things we take for granted.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greason predicts that government will take the lead in long-range exploration, but that industry will take up the slack closer to home. Just as the military relies on private air carriers, he said, ''the government efforts will become customers of the private efforts.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will meanwhile be trying to extend the reach of humanity. Mr. Griffin, its administrator, laid out a rough timetable for the goals that President Bush set in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees the mileposts clearly along the way, returning to the Moon by 2020, with a ''small lunar outpost'' a few years later, on the way to ''towns on the Moon.'' The first flights to Mars could occur in the next decade, he said, so that by the 100th anniversary of spaceflight in 2057, ''we can be looking back at the 20th anniversary of the first human landing on Mars.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the United States wants to lead the way, he said, the clock is ticking.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the last generation of Americans which is going to have the unquestioned opportunity to lead that enterprise,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''Because in the next generation we are going to find, at least, Russia, China, India and Europe fully as capable as we are. It will be a matter of interest and politics and societal will or desire. But it will not be a matter of capability.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whoever takes them on, the challenges will be greater than any that spacefaring nations have yet faced. They involve radiation levels that science does not yet know how to protect against and problems like reduced gravity and Moon dust, which is ultrafine-grained, chemically reactive and highly abrasive, all of which may mean serious health problems for astronauts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference in June on lunar settlements, Dr. James S. Logan, a former chief of medical operations at the Johnson Space Center and a founder of Space Medicine Associates, a medical consulting group, pointed out that the previous missions to the Moon involved just 600 total man-hours on the surface, a figure likely to be exceeded on the first return mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his presentation, Dr. Logan pointed out that the earlier exposure times, ''while significant,'' did not provide strong evidence that long-duration exposure would be safe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference on space medicine this year at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, Peggy A. Whitson, an astronaut who is about to take her second stint aboard the International Space Station, said radiation would continue to be a concern.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to just accept the fact that if we're going to explore,'' Dr. Whitson said, ''we're going to have to accept a higher level of radiation'' than, say, OSHA permits for atomic workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon on the panel with Dr. Whitson, said, ''To me, an unacceptable level of risk would be a radiation exposure that would result in acute and substantial performance effects, either fatality or cognitive decline.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the effects are so debilitating that the mission fails, Dr. Clark said, ''it's pointless to go.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There could be other problems with a Mars mission that scientists are just beginning to explore. At the Rice conference, Dr. Nick Kanas of the University of California, San Francisco, a psychiatrist who has studied astronauts, described what he called the ''Earth out of view'' phenomenon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kanas's research has found that one of the most positive parts of going to space is seeing the Earth. But on a trip to Mars, the Earth would dwindle to a bluish speck.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one in the history of humans has ever studied what it's like to see the Earth as a little dot,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Dr. Kanas said losing the visual connection with the home planet could be a ''unique stressor.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communications would slow markedly, with lags of more than 40 minutes, he said. Ready access to powerful telescopes and libraries of Earth images might help, but it would be important to fight those feelings of ''extreme isolation and loneliness.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin acknowledged that problems like radiation presented grave challenges in each new environment, but added that he was confident that protections would be discovered, just as early sailors learned that sauerkraut and lemons could protect them from scurvy on long voyages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he predicted that the lessons learned about bone growth, cell biology, damage prevention and repair would help treat diseases on Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schmitt, the Apollo astronaut, agreed. Despite very real risks of living in space and on other planets, he said, ''I don't see any showstoppers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Witt, general manager of the Mojave Air and Space Port, takes an even longer view. In his office, with composite craft being designed in nearby buildings, Mr. Witt noted that five centuries ago, Magellan left Spain with five ships and 270 men. Two years later, one ship returned, with 18 men.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He quoted from memory a passage from Charles Van Doren's book ''A History of Knowledge: Past, Present, and Future'' (1991), pointing out that after the surviving ship returned loaded with valuable spices, subsequent expeditions ''never lacked for sailors to man them and for captains to lead them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They knew that the spirit of exploration was far bigger than any individual,'' Mr. Witt said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument resonates with Mr. Griffin: ''Every time that humans have invested in the past in breaking through new frontiers, it's been to our profit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may be tough on the individual explorers, but it's been pretty beneficial for the human race -- as we sit here,'' he continued, waving his arms to take in his office, Washington and America, ''in what once was the New World.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll lose people,'' he said flatly, and risks must be minimized. But exploring is ''embedded in our DNA.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The urge to go beyond might actually be ingrained in the helical curves of our genes as one of the many behavioral traits now being linked to genetic propensities, said Jeffrey M. Friedman, director of the Starr Center for Human Genetics at the Rockefeller University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indulging in a bit of speculation at a reporter's request, Dr. Friedman said ''it's very plausible to suggest'' that there might be a primal urge to explore and take risks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And you sort of have direct evidence of it in the history of human migrations,'' he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any population, there would be a spectrum of traits from stay-at-homes to explorers, with those at either end of the spectrum prospering in some circumstances and suffering in others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future holds promise and peril, as any visitor to Mojave can see. At Scaled Composites, an explosion last month killed three employees. The accident involved the nitrous oxide that Scaled Composites uses as a propellant, though there was no rocket test at the time. The accident is under investigation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the company continues to develop its next craft, and Virgin Galactic said no customers had canceled. When asked whether the accident gave him second thoughts, James Lovelock, the 88-year-old British scientist and author, said, ''I have no qualms whatever.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some space age. It has been 35 years since anybody was on the Moon, or more than 300 miles from Earth, for that matter. NASA says it will be 2020 before astronauts get back to the Moon, meaning that it will have taken twice as long this time from presidential declaration (Bush in 2003) to actual landing than the first time around, when President John F. Kennedy declared in 1961 that America would land on the Moon within the decade, and Apollo 11 launched eight years later. You are free to make your own guesses about Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're not a reporter covering the space program or a scientist who uses space instruments, you probably have never met anyone who has seen the curve of the Earth with his or her own eyes. It is as if the response to Christopher Columbus's voyage had been confined to mapping the reefs off Spain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't supposed to be like this.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Sputnik was launched, transforming what my parents thought of as an unhealthy obsession with science fiction and all things atomic or cosmic into the stuff of patriotic heroism, my friends and I already knew how the future was supposed to unfold: Arthur C. Clarke (Sir Arthur now), Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury, among many others, had laid it all out in stories and novels that we stole from the local drug store: the space stations, the Moonbases and Mars colonies, the lonely asteroid prospectors, the nuclear wars back home, the eventual dispersal of humanity to far flung stars where Earth is only a dim legend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great space visionaries like Wernher von Braun, Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, as well as the men and women of NASA, all drank the same Kool-Aid. But NASA, as the current administrator Michael D. Griffin will be the first to tell you, works for the president. As a result, true believers over the ages have had to hitch their wagons to whatever political star is in vogue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sputnik was an almost accidental outgrowth of the arms race, as Matthew Brzezinski's new history, ''Red Moon Rising,'' makes grippingly clear. Neither Nikita S. Khrushchev nor Dwight D. Eisenhower understood at first how important and ominous that little beeping ball orbiting the Earth was. After the United States reclaimed its missile manhood by landing men on the Moon, President Richard M. Nixon had no more use for the Apollo program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space aficionados have been wandering in the political wilderness ever since, looking for a way to make cosmic affairs matter again. Curiosity? It doesn't seem to be enough to loosen the purse strings these days. American economic competitiveness? A recent NASA slogan, ''NASA explores for answers that power our future,'' didn't exactly stir the blood. To escape some planetary apocalypse like an asteroid or plague? So far we can't seem to get out of our own way regarding greenhouse gases and global warming.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can think of many much worse ways than space exploration to put my tax dollars to work, but the space dream has been dead for me since the early 1980s, when I chanced to see a particular photograph of a shuttle launching. The photo was taken from a chase plane. It shows a tower of smoke rising upward from the Earth's surface, which is blurred by the haze of altitude and clouds. Near the tower's glowing top, like a pinhead on Jack's beanstalk, is the space shuttle, dwarfed by its own plume, roaring away as hard as it can.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, on a pillar of violence, is your dream of transcendence, of freedom, of escape from killer rocks in the sky, boiling oceans or whatever postmodern plague science comes up with. Of galactic immortality.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That picture broke my heart. I'd seen rocket launches before and been appropriately chastened by the thunder and heat it took to break free of gravity, but I had never seen it from such a perspective. So much work for such a small step into the universe. How could this ever be routine, economical or safe?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't get me wrong. In the long run, humans or their successors have no choice but to get out there where the asteroids and cosmic rays roam. The Earth, after all, is doomed to boil in a billion or so years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently I sent an e-mail message to Sir Arthur asking him how he felt about the progress, or lack thereof, in space exploration since Sputnik. In addition to being a visionary writer, he invented the idea of the communications satellite, and for the last few decades has been plugging the idea of a space elevator, which could haul people and things nonviolently to geosynchronous orbit, 22,240 miles high, perhaps with superstrong nanotubes. He was encouraged by the prospects of such a contraption and the advent of what he called ''citizen astronauts.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remain optimistic that the best is yet to come,'' he wrote from Sri Lanka.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the last 50 years haven't all been a letdown. Science, despite being relegated to the tail end of NASA's budget, has begun to illuminate space and the universe to a degree no one imagined, probably because none of my sci-fi gurus foresaw Moore's Law, by which the capabilities of computer chips have doubled every year and a half.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who dreamed that space would be peppered with black holes popping off X-rays? Who dreamed that you could have a baby picture of the universe when it was only 400,000 years old and a seething fireball? Spy satellites have allowed the United States and Russia to take the first timid steps backward from atomic catastrophe -- surely that deserves a Nobel Prize for some spook somewhere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I write this, the Mars Phoenix lander is approaching Mars with, among other things, the names of 250,000 Earthlings, including those of my wife and daughter. Voyager 1 is leaving the solar system with a recording of Beethoven, Chuck Berry, whale songs and the sound of a kiss, among other things. It won't be long before space probes are carrying genome sequences and even genes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this context the grapes don't seem so sour to me (although there is a lot more science they could be doing).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our machines have gone ahead of us. But someday people will hike through the canyons of Mars. I just don't know when or how or who. Maybe it will be the Chinese, who seem to still feel that they have something to prove as a nation. Maybe it will be billionaire adventurers -- like the  <span class="companylink">Google</span> founders who just put up a $25 million prize for the first private Moon lander, who are free to risk their own money and don't have to answer to Congress when things go wrong, as they sometimes will -- who make the dream come true, for at least a few.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will always be someone willing to ride a pillar of fire into the unknown, but it won't be me. I don't want to go to Mars anymore. I no longer have the stuff -- if in fact I ever did -- to camp out in a tin can for two years. I'd be afraid to be so far from the Earth and my family for so long.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't want my daughter to go either, for the same reason. When our children do go off forever across the void then we will have a chance to find out if we are as strong as our ancestors who bundled their children onto ships in the hope they would reach a better world across the ocean. Someday, somebody will go and not come back, and humans will have escaped their nest, for better or for worse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no galactic immortality. Everything we are and have done, the whole Milky Way with its billions of stars, is eventually destined to be swallowed up in a black hole. Neither ourselves nor our works will survive the end of the universe, if dark energy eventually blows it apart, no matter what we do. All we own is the present, so it behooves each of us to live each moment impeccably, guided by whatever lights we choose. Speaking only for myself, while we are around we might as well embrace the light and the unknown, the violence and vastness that terrify us.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My sci-fi dreams are dead, but Sir Richard Branson and his fellow space entrepreneurs say they have business plans. If Mr. Branson manages to get the cosmologist Stephen Hawking into space and back, he will have done more for the cause of space exploration than 25 years of space shuttles going around in circles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching the Apollo astronauts recount their travels to the Moon in the documentary ''In the Shadow of the Moon,'' I was wiping away tears for a time when we had bold dreams and leaders who, for whatever motives, could make them happen. Neil Armstrong's footprints on the Moon are as crisp as the day he made them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will always be glad I was alive when he took that small step, even if we are still waiting for the next big leap.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years after Sputnik, on Sept. 5, 1977, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its twin, Voyager 2, had been launched a couple of weeks earlier, on Aug. 20, 1977.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three decades later, both Voyagers continue traveling outward, still taking measurements and still radioing their findings back to Earth. Voyager 1, now more than 9.6 billion miles away, is the most distant human-made object, traveling at 38,400 miles per hour. It has entered the outermost neighborhood of the solar system, the heliopause, where the winds of charged particles flying out from the Sun have diminished to subsonic speeds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the solar winds come to a stop, Voyager 1 will have officially left the solar system and entered interstellar space. That moment is not expected until 2015. But remarkably, scientists say, the spacecraft might continue transmitting its data back to Earth. Voyager's power supply, a chunk of radioactive plutonium, should last until 2020.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2, which took a slower trajectory, is a mere 7.8 billion miles away and has yet to reach the heliopause, although there are signs that it is very close. ''I'd be surprised if we haven't crossed it by the end of this year,'' said Edward C. Stone, project scientist of the Voyager mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2 might make it to interstellar space a decade from now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various components of the spacecraft have worn out, scientists say, and the Voyagers now rely on backup systems. But the outer solar system is a relatively benign place. The Voyagers were built to survive the intense radiation belts of Jupiter and, while crossing Saturn's rings, possible impacts with ring particles. After those obstacles had been passed, ''then we knew had a good chance of lasting a long time,'' Dr. Stone said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stone, who was named to project scientist in 1972, hopes to last a while longer, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been working on this for 35 years,'' said Dr. Stone, now 71. ''I'm not going to give up yet.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars rover Opportunity, which spent two months standing still as a dust storm swirled around it, is to resume its studies today. After the skies cleared and its batteries recharged, the rover rolled about 60 feet into Victoria Crater, a half-mile-wide hole scooped out by a meteor strike. There, it is to examine an intriguing light-colored ring that goes around the crater. Scientists believe the ''bathtub ring'' was the layer of rocks on the surface when the meteor struck and may preserve chemical hints of the ancient atmosphere.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUSTIN, Tex. -- Richard Garriott hefts his Sputnik overhead like a shiny aluminum beach ball, playing with history.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a beautiful thing,'' Mr. Garriott says of the hollow sphere with its four famous whisker antennas, which he has left partly disassembled so the shortened shafts can serve as legs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most collectors of space memorabilia buy things like astronaut autographs, mission patches and ''flown'' goods -- objects that have made the trip to space and back, and which then make their way to auctions, swap meets and collector Web sites.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Garriott, 46, has amassed a personal fortune that is measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars, thanks to his pioneering role as a creator of computer games, so his treasures tend to be actual treasures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The object that Mr. Garriott jokingly calls ''Mr. Sputnik'' is not, of course, the actual Sputnik that the Soviet Union launched 50 years ago, on Oct. 4, 1957. That one burned up as it re-entered the atmosphere three months later. But neither is it one of the many replicas manufactured after the fact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Records are hard to come by and facts are hard to verify, said Robert Pearlman, who runs the Web site collectspace.com. But after looking into Mr. Garriott's purchase, he said, ''I am convinced that it's authentic.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his research with the Russian space agency, Mr. Pearlman said, he found that it was one of only a half dozen spares that were made. In fact, he said, it is ''the only Sputnik I have been able to verify is in private hands.'' The one hanging in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington? A vintage replica on loan from the Russian Academy of Sciences. ''There are other claims,'' he said, ''but they are dubious.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some question whether spares exist at all. Charles Schollenberger, a collector in Prairie Village, Kan., who has followed the trail to Russian designers who worked on the original, said flatly, ''The many people who have bought 'duplicates' or 'backups' over the years have unfortunately bought the Russian equivalent of the Brooklyn Bridge.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Garriott, in any case, Sputnik is virtually part of the family. He grew up with a foot in space; his father, Owen K. Garriott, is a retired astronaut who spent 60 days aboard Skylab in 1973 and who flew on the space shuttle in 1983.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up in a Houston suburb near the NASA space center, life was less like the Waltons than the Jetsons, the younger Mr. Garriott recalled. The neighbors were astronauts and space agency engineers. His father brought home gadgets NASA was testing, like the early version of a night-vision scope that Richard Garriott used to track the family cats in the backyard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the younger Mr. Garriott entered the University of Texas, he was already well along his career path, blending the talents he inherited from his scientist father and his mother, Helen Garriott, an artist. He turned early personal computers into machines that could entertain and created the Ultima series of fantasy computer games. (His latest game, Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa, is to be released by NCsoft on Oct. 19.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he grew more successful, he began traveling and collecting things that reflected his interests. He has visited all seven continents, hunting for meteorites in Antarctica and checking out hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garriott built a hilltop home outside of Austin that houses his collections and has an observatory, secret passageways and a dungeon. He shows it all off with a child's delight, relishing the technical details of objects like automatons, the gearwork devices that were precursors to robots; a navigational sphere, a handheld planetarium projector used on Russian space missions to align the capsule visually; and a sextant used by the Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton. ''It's all related,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little wonder, then, that when a Sputnik became available from the cash-strapped Russians in the post-Soviet fire sale, he snapped it up, spending less than $15,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shipper he was working with, however, warned that customs agents might cause problems for transporting the odd, and perhaps ominous-looking, artifact. So the shipper carefully removed the antennas and the tiny screws that held the device together, separating it into two large half spheres.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We described them as salad bowls'' on the customs forms, Mr. Garriott said with a mischievous smile. ''It came through without a hiccup.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Sputnik will never beep. The electronics that filled the original were not made for every spare, Mr. Pearlman said. Mr. Garriott's contained a small box of mounting brackets and connectors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pearlman, who is publishing an article about Mr. Garriott's Sputnik on his site this week and who once worked at Space Adventures, a space tourism company Mr. Garriott helped to found, estimates that the current value at auction could be $400,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garriott mentioned to his father that he owned a Sputnik only in recent weeks, and was surprised to discover that his father's link was even stronger than he had known.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owen Garriott sent his son an excited e-mail message describing that Friday, Oct. 4, 1957, when he was a graduate student studying radio technology at Stanford University. A crowd formed at the radio lab and tuned in to hear the distinctive be-beep, be-beep, be-beep. They noticed a Doppler shift -- the phenomenon that makes a train whistle sound higher when approaching and deeper as it departs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elder Mr. Garriott wrote, ''This provided me a fantastic opportunity to get started in research on radio signals from Earth satellites and the effects produced on them by passage through the Earth's ionosphere at the very beginning of the space age.'' This became the topic of his Ph.D. dissertation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Garriott said, ''The reason my dad was chosen as an astronaut was largely through his work in radio-wave propagation.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the younger Mr. Garriott plans to follow in his father's extraterrestrial footsteps: he has bought a $30 million seat on a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station scheduled for next October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not just a joy ride, he explained in an e-mail message. His family history, he said, has led him to believe that taking on these extreme and rare challenges ''comes with almost a moral obligation to do them not as a lark, but rather in the service of science or humanity at some level.'' He plans to take experiments with him intended to test processes that could be used in drug development.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, he added, he is hoping to accomplish something on the flight that no other space tourist has done: take a spacewalk, an option Space Adventures announced last year for an extra $15 million. ''But that is NOT yet set in stone,'' he wrote. He has had two suited-up training sessions in a Russian underwater facility, he said, and ''It's MUCH harder than it looks.'' Air pressure stiffens the suit, and every movement is a struggle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I now know why my dad always had hand gripper exercise devices at his desk.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: Mr. Garriott's collection includes, from left, models of a moon rover; Space Ship One, the first privately financed manned spacecraft; and the Skylab space station, on which his father spent time; Richard Garriott's Soviet space collection includes the spare Sputnik satellite he holds, a diving suit, left, and a space suit.
