<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Robert Cobb, resigned. Three senators, two Democrats and a Republican, two weeks ago urged President Obama to oust Mr. Cobb, saying he ''has been repeatedly accused of stifling investigations'' and ''retaliating'' against whistle-blowers. An audit this year found that Mr. Cobb saved taxpayers only 36 cents for every dollar he spent on investigations. The average for other inspectors general was $9.49. The Government Accountability Office, Congress's investigative and auditing arm, found that Mr. Cobb's office ''has generally not focused on audits with recommendations for improving the economy and efficiency of NASA's programs ... with potential monetary savings.'' Mr. Cobb was appointed to the job in 2002 by President George W. Bush.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the Cassini mission, scientists have learned much in recent years about Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Among other things, they know it has sand dunes, lakes of liquid methane and, perhaps, icy volcanoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They now know something about its shape as well. Using data from radar instruments on Cassini, Howard A. Zebker of Stanford University and colleagues have determined that Titan bulges slightly around the middle and is squashed at the poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The degree of this oblateness is small, the researchers report in a paper published online by Science. It's also not surprising, Dr. Zebker said, ''because Titan rotates much as Earth does'' (and Earth is squashed, too). Titan always has the same face toward Saturn, and the planet's strong gravitational pull causes solid tides within the moon, adding to the deformation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Titan's shape doesn't quite match what would be expected from theory. One possible explanation, Dr. Zebker said, is that there is uneven distribution of heat within Titan's core. Or the moon might have been closer to Saturn at some point, when its shape would have formed and been ''frozen in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titan's oblateness may also help explain why its methane lakes are concentrated near the poles. If there is a ''methane table'' (analogous to a water table on Earth), then the liquid would be more likely to reach the surface in areas of lower elevation, like the poles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian space agency on Tuesday ordered design work to start for a next-generation spaceship capable of flying to the moon. It granted a $23 million contract for work on a new, reusable craft to replace the 40-year-old Soyuz. The Russian spaceship could emerge as a potential competitor to NASA's prospective Orion spacecraft. Design requirements for the Russian craft appear similar to Orion's specification, prompting some experts to nickname it Orionski.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An $11 million NASA study that interviewed thousands of pilots in hopes of uncovering emerging safety trends remains in unanalyzed limbo. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration devised the study in 1997 and interviewed pilots from 2001 to 2004, but then killed the project. A report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that the study was well designed, but ended up with little to show because of shortcomings in its carrying out and resistance from federal aviation regulators. To extract reliable findings would take much more money and research, the accounting office said, and the findings might not be applicable to air travel today.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on April 14 about John Grunsfeld, an astronaut who is scheduled to lead the final servicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope, referred incorrectly to the capacity of the indoor pool where Dr. Grunsfeld does some training for the mission. The pool holds 6 million gallons, not 11 million. The article also described incorrectly the events leading to his decision to return to the United States after working in Tokyo. Dr. Grunsfeld was living in a Zen monastery, meditating in the morning and then going to work at the University of Tokyo. He came home early one day and found the monks watching baseball on television, breaking the spell of his experience there. He did not find the monks playing baseball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Apr 29 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON -- John Grunsfeld was sitting in an astronomical meeting in Atlanta in January of 2004 when he got a message to come back to headquarters in Washington to talk about the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To say that he was excited would be an understatement. As an astronaut, Dr. Grunsfeld had twice journeyed to space to make repairs on humanity's most vaunted eye on the cosmos, experiences he had described to a high-level panel pondering Hubble's fate only a few months before as the most meaningful in his life. He was looking forward to leading the third and final servicing mission, which had been delayed by the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinking that the mission was now being scheduled, Dr. Grunsfeld raced to Washington, only to learn that Sean O'Keefe, NASA's administrator, had canceled it on the ground that it was too risky. Wearing his other hat as NASA's chief scientist, Dr. Grunsfeld now had the job of telling the world that the space agency was basically abandoning its greatest scientific instrument at the same time that it was laying plans for the even riskier and more expensive effort to return humans to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he felt as if he had been hit by a two-by-four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being an astronaut, there are not a lot of things that have really shocked me in my life,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said in a recent interview. But, he added, ''I don't think anybody could ever prepare themselves for, you know, trying to bury something that they have said, 'Hey, this is worth risking my life for.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went home that January night and wondered whether he should resign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years later, Dr. Grunsfeld reported for work at an 11 million-gallon indoor pool near the Johnson Space Center in his long underwear and a red baseball cap bearing an image of Curious George in a spacesuit. The pool's blue depths contained sunken replicas of the Hubble and the International Space Station. Surrounded by divers and helpers, Dr. Grunsfeld squirmed into a 400-pound set of overalls known as a space suit. He was preparing to practice for his return to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On May 12, he and six other astronauts commanded by Scott Altman are scheduled to ride to the telescope's rescue one last time aboard the shuttle Atlantis. This will be the fifth and last time astronauts visit Hubble. When the telescope's batteries and gyros finally run out of juice sometime in the middle of the next decade, NASA plans to send a rocket and drop it into the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well in what Dr. Grunsfeld described as ''brain surgery'' in space, Hubble will be left at the apex of its scientific capability. As chief Hubble repairman for the past 18 years, he has been intertwined with the Hubble telescope physically, as well as intellectually and emotionally. ''He might be the only person on Earth who has observed with Hubble and touched Hubble,'' said Bruce Margon, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and former deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, Dr. Grunsfeld and his crewmates were two weeks from blasting off for Hubble when a data router failed, shutting down the telescope until a backup could be booted up. The servicing mission was postponed so that NASA could prepare a replacement router, adding another degree of difficulty to an already crowded and high-stakes agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To accommodate installing the new router, mission planners had to cut into the time allotted for the repair and resurrection of Hubble's main camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys. That repair was originally scheduled to happen over two spacewalks, and now planners are hoping to be able to do it a few hours on one spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it cannot be done, Dr. Grunsfeld said grimly, the pictures that have inspired people around the world, pinpointed planets around other stars and helped investigate the fate of a cosmos dominated by dark energy will be lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anybody is up to the challenge, it seems to be Dr. Grunsfeld, who will be making his fifth trip to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Turner, a cosmologist and former colleague at the University of Chicago, described Dr. Grunsfeld's career as ''Mr. Smith goes to space.'' He said: ''Everything turns to magic even when things go bad. In the end it gets righted and he gets to lead the team.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld's whole life has led to Hubble. Born in Chicago in 1958 into a family of architects -- his grandfather designed the Adler Planetarium -- Dr. Grunsfeld said he yearned from age 6 to be an astronaut. Science soon beckoned as an alternative. By the time he reached college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology his interests were centered on physics and cosmology. To make some money as an undergraduate, he took a job for $4 an hour on the graveyard shift in the control room for a small satellite, known as Sas-3, which was observing X-rays. Sometimes he took his dates there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job led to a year in Tokyo, where he lived in a Zen monastery, meditating in the morning and teaching and working with an X-ray astronomer, Minoru Oda, at the University of Tokyo in the afternoon. When he came home early one day and found the monks playing baseball, a spell was broken. He returned to Chicago to get a Ph.D. doing cosmic ray research at the University of Chicago. Along the way he married a woman he had known in high school, Carol Schiff. They now have two children, and she is an accountant at the Johnson Space Center. Dr. Grunsfeld then took a job at the California Institute of Technology, and he and his wife both learned to fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When NASA invited him to an interview in 1991, Dr. Grunsfeld flew his own plane to Houston. On his first space flight, a 16-day mission in 1995 tending a suite of small telescopes, Dr. Grunsfeld did not want to come down. ''I had this real feeling of peace, you know, that I never had here on planet Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld went up again on a 10-day mission to the Mir space station, in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, he said, ''I got lucky and got assigned to Hubble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble had already been through high drama. Launched to great fanfare in 1990 as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope, it had turned out to have a misshapen mirror and was branded a ''technoturkey.'' In 1993, in the first on-orbit telescope servicing, astronauts installed corrective optics on Hubble, restoring the telescope's vision and promise, and astronomers' faith in NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only reason Hubble works is because we have a space shuttle,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''And of all things we do, I think Hubble is probably the best thing we use it for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By December 1999, however, Hubble was in trouble again. Four of the six gyroscopes that keep the telescope pointed had broken down, and the telescope had gone into a so-called safe mode, suspending science operations. As a result NASA officials split a planned servicing mission into two parts and rushed the astronauts up to the telescope to replace the gyros and perform other vital tasks. Coming out of the hatch on his first spacewalk, Dr. Grunsfeld had a moment of unreality. ''I mean it was just too magical. Three hundred miles below me is the Earth. There I was a meter away from the Hubble Space Telescope. I couldn't resist. I had to take a finger and reach out and touch it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the longest spacewalks to date, more than eight hours, Dr. Grunsfeld and his spacewalking partner, Steven Smith, replaced the telescope's gyros, a job that Dr. Grunsfeld described as ''an icky task'' because the gyros are in a delicate and awkward spot. He discovered that he had a knack for getting things done Out There.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said he could get so involved in his task that he would forget he was in a space suit wearing gloves, a feeling he calls the Zen of space. ''And once you're outside working, you know, all the rest of the world disappears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once in a while the universe lets you be free alone and in peace,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his second mission to the telescope, in 2002, the cooling system in Dr. Grunsfeld's spacesuit sprang a leak as he was about to leave the airlock, necessitating a quick change before mission control could cancel the spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the airlock, the Zen of space took over. He thought of nothing except his task of replacing 34 tightly packed connectors in a power control unit that had not been designed to be repaired in space. ''And the Zen part,'' he explained, ''is that I had trained myself in the challenge of connecting all these connectors to only think about one connector.'' It would simply be too overwhelming to think about them all at once. ''So I only ever had one connector to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ideal job, Dr. Grunsfeld said, would be to spend six months on the International Space Station. ''I would like to live in space,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the attractions of that lifestyle is unique to physicists. When the shuttle passes through a zone in its orbit called the South Atlantic Anomaly, astronauts are exposed to large doses of cosmic rays, high-energy particles from the Sun or distant galaxies, which leave a wake of visible light as they pass through a dark-adapted human eyeball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In space you can get in touch with your quantum self,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''I was a human cosmic ray detector.'' He said he could identify the different kinds of particles zooming through his eyeball by how bright the flashes were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven in February 2003 threw the American space program into crisis. Ultimately, as a result, the Hubble Telescope faced its greatest perils on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Busy with his chief scientist duties and helping to roll out the scientific aspects to President George W. Bush's Moon-Mars initiative in the winter of 2003-2004, Dr. Grunsfeld, who describes himself as ''fat, dumb and happy,'' did not see the decision to cancel Hubble coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it happened, he called John Bahcall, the late astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study and behind-scenes-eminence for Hubble, and asked his advice. He could either stay and fight, probably losing, Dr. Grunsfeld told Dr. Bahcall, ''Or I throw my badge down and, you know, walk away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bahcall told him not to worry. If he left, the astronomical community would regard him as a hero, he would be able to get a job anywhere he wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And then there was the pregnant pause. But--'' Dr. Grunsfeld recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he left, Dr. Bahcall warned, he would lose all his ability to help the rest of the science NASA was doing, X-ray satellites and gravitation-wave observatories that were dear to his heart as a high-energy physicist. There was no guarantee that anybody else would be there to protect this work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And that had a very calming effect on me,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said, ''and he was absolutely right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week later, Dr. Grunsfeld presided over a news conference, defending the decision that Hubble would be abandoned. ''It's a sad day that we have to announce this,'' he said. The decision meant the telescope was doomed to die in orbit by 2007 or 2008 when its batteries and gyros gave out, and it sparked worldwide consternation and criticism of Dr. Grunsfeld as well as Mr. O'Keefe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The criticism of Dr. Grunsfeld was resented by astronomy insiders. ''There was never any doubt that he was one of us,'' said Dr. Margon, who was then deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute. ''He handled it all with tremendous grace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld decided that his new job was to work within the system to save Hubble. With the support of Mr. O'Keefe, who was shaken by news reports of schoolchildren offering to pool their pennies to keep Hubble alive and working, Dr. Grunsfeld pushed a proposal by Frank Cepollina of the Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Md., to send a robot to service the telescope. The robot mission was eventually scotched by a National Academy of Sciences panel of experts. Mr. O'Keefe resigned and was replaced by Michael Griffin, who reinstated the Hubble mission. In the meantime, the engineering team at Goddard and its expertise needed for Hubble servicing had been kept alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we hadn't gone down that road,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said, ''NASA would have terminated all the contracts, the big contracts, and there would be no recourse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Dr. Griffin's decision, more has gone wrong with Hubble than could have been fixed by a robot, anyway. Two of the telescope's most important instruments -- a spectrograph named STIS, which made the first atmospheric measurements of a planet around another star, and the Advanced Camera for Surveys -- have failed. Neither was designed to be repaired in space. When the advanced camera stopped working in 2007, the Hubble engineers first said that prospects for repair were poor. Now they have a plan. ''For the first time,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said, ''we're going to go in and open boxes of tiny screws, take circuit cards out and replace the circuit cards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectrograph has only one card, but the camera has four. Moreover, the camera is around a corner and behind a strut where it cannot be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recent underwater rehearsal on a sunken replica of the Hubble, Dr. Grunsfeld was showing off a pair of ultra-sensitive gloves that will help him to feel around the corners during the mission. When he climbed back out of the water, he reported that he and Dr. Andrew Feustel, his spacewalking partner, had once again managed the camera repair, and in jig time, although a foot restraint had broken partway through. That, he said, was good practice for the frustrations of real space work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be with mixed emotions, Dr. Grunsfeld said, that he hugs Hubble for the last time -- the last time that any human will touch it. ''I try and tell myself it's just a satellite,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his involvement with Hubble will continue. He has been given observing time on the telescope, which he said he will use to study the Moon's Tycho crater, formed by an impact 70 million or 90 million years ago, about the time that an asteroid is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said that this would probably be his last flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I achieved everything I ever wanted after my first spaceflight,'' he said, wearing his space monkey hat. ''To be the Hubble repairman is really just unbelievable.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain View, Calif. -- IT'S a birthright proffered by science and prophesied by ''Star Trek,'' ''Battlestar Galactica'' and a thousand other space operas: We're destined to go to the stars. Our descendants will spread beyond this nondescript solar system and seek adventure and bumpy-headed pals in the stellar realms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, cool your warp jets, Mr. Scott, because we're not about to breach the final frontier. Piling into a starship and barreling into deep space may long remain -- like perfect children or effort-free bathroom cleaners -- a pipe dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest rocket ever launched, NASA's New Horizons probe to Pluto, roared off its pad in 2006 at 10 miles per second. That pace would be impressive in the morning commute, and it's passably adequate for traversing the solar system, something we've done and will continue to do. Combustion rockets, like New Horizons, can deliver you to the Moon in a matter of days, Mars in a matter of months, and the outer planets in a matter of years. But a trip to Proxima Centauri, the nearest star beyond the Sun and 100 million times farther from us than the Moon, would consume a tedious 800 centuries or so. You'll want to upgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll build faster spacecraft, of course. Many have been designed, including ion beam rockets that shoot particles from their nozzles rather than hot gas, and nuclear-powered models. The former made their debut in NASA's Deep Space 1 mission to investigate asteroids and could conceivably cruise at 50 miles per second. Atomic rockets, whose development was halted by test-ban treaties in the '60s, had a target velocity 20 times greater. Alas, despite these snappier speeds, such craft are still untenable for manned journeys to the stars, taking at least a dozen lifetimes to reach the nearest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carting humans into deep space requires technology akin to wormhole rockets or matter-antimatter engines, the standard transports of science fiction. Wormhole travel, which takes shortcuts to the stars by warping space, looks appealing on blackboards, but physicists can't yet say whether it would ever work in practice. Matter-antimatter engines use the enormous energy released when ordinary atoms encounter their exotic, opposite numbers, demanding the creation and storage of large amounts of hard-to-contain antimatter -- a Sisyphean task, to put it gently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, such sci-fi crafts would get embarrassingly bad mileage. The energy required to reach even the nearest stars in a decade or less with a very modest-size starship (say, the tonnage of the 17th-century Mayflower) equals the total energy consumed in the United States last year. At 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, that's a fuel bill of $5 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of improvement in rocketry is languid. It will be a decade before NASA's new Orion spacecraft allows humans to revisit the Moon, a short cosmic hop. And while today's launching vehicles are more powerful than their predecessors, the speeds are hardly impressive. The New Horizons probe cleared the pad at a clip barely twice that of the Atlas rocket that hoisted John Glenn into orbit at the dawn of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while there's little doubt that humanity will soon explore and eventually colonize the Moon, Mars and the satellites and asteroids of the outer solar system, sending humans beyond that is impractical for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's another technology that's developing at a breakneck clip, and with which our grandchildren could make virtual trips to other solar systems. It's called telepresence -- a collection of technologies that extends vision, hearing and touch far beyond the corporeal confines of our nervous system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider that in 1965 the Mariner 4 spacecraft made the first fuzzy photos of Mars with a black-and-white TV camera boasting 40,000 pixels. The HiRISE camera now operating onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter sports 200 million pixels. It can snap photos of objects just three feet across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's resolution comparable to what's on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, which many people use to examine remote parts of the globe or inspect cities known only from the nightly news. <span class="companylink">Google</span> Mars takes advantage of the high-quality imagery being collected by our robotic orbiters, enabling armchair astronauts to peruse the red planet in considerable detail without the angst of transporting their delicate protoplasm 34 million miles into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photography from the Mars Exploration Rover is so good that the data have been interpreted in an IMAX film, giving audiences a near-lifelike experience in strolling the red planet's rusty, dusty desert. The Phoenix Mars lander has sent back pictures of individual sand grains. In other words, it's already possible for anyone to make a rigorous reconnaissance of another planet -- even though not a single human has yet stomped his boots in the Martian dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not merely the tired argument over manned versus unmanned space missions. Sending humans to the stars is simply not in the offing. But this is how we could survey other worlds, around other suns. We fling data-collecting, robotic craft to the stars. These proxy explorers can be very small, and consequently can be shot spaceward at tremendous speed even with the types of rockets now available. Robot probes don't require life support systems, don't get sick or claustrophobic and don't insist on round-trip tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A plausible solution would be to re-energize NASA's development of nuclear-powered rockets, with the intention of building a craft able to send clusters of micro-bots into deep space at velocities of, say, one-tenth light speed. Depending on financing and our ability to garner international cooperation, these probes could be sent off before the 21st century starts to wane. By the middle of the following century, on-the-scene data from Epsilon Eridani, the nearest known planetary system, could be in our hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These microbots would supply the information that, fed to computers, would allow us to explore alien planets in the same way that we navigate the virtual spaces of video games or wander through online environments like Second Life. High-tech masks and data gloves, sartorial accessories considerably more comfortable than a spacesuit, would permit you to see the landscape, touch objects and even smell the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our desire to walk a landscape that basks in the light of another star, to hear the whistle of an alien planet's wind and feel its sting on our faces, will not -- any century soon -- be sated by hurling massive, human-filled starships into space. Instead, we will extend our senses light-years beyond Earth with these telepresence proxies and data collectors. That's a far more realistic version of the ''Star Trek'' future: to explore distant worlds, under alien suns, without leaving the familiar surroundings of our terrestrial home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the otherworldly concerns raised by space travel, fashion is chief among them. Even spacesuits aren't immune to the changing winds of style -- one minute it's gold-visored helmets, the next it's all about blue silicone soles. ''Spacesuits: Within the Collections of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum'' (Powerhouse Books), written and compiled by the museum's resident space historian Amanda Young, showcases the most interesting of the 3,000 intergalactic artifacts from the Smithsonian vaults, many of which have not been shown to the public until now. Highlights include the campy, custom-made aluminized suits worn by the ''Mercury Seven'' for their first mission (the filmmaker Michel Gondry would be over the moon) and a pair of astro gloves from 1967 that feature sharkskin pads and pressure-resistant stainless steel ''fingernails.'' While NASA no longer offers bespoke suits for its astronauts, it recently hired a new company, <span class="companylink">Oceaneering International</span>, to revamp its look.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European astronomers said Tuesday that they had discovered the smallest planet yet found orbiting another star. The planet could be as little as only 1.9 times as massive as the Earth and belongs to a dim red star known as Gliese 581, which lies about 20 light-years from Earth in the constellation Libra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star was already know to harbor at least three more massive planets. The new planet, known as Gliese 581e, is probably rocky like the Earth, but it lies in such a close orbit -- only three million miles from its star -- that it is surely blasted with too much radiation and heat to be livable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michel Mayor, of Geneva Observatory, and his colleagues announced their results at a conference at the University of Hertfordshire in Britain and in a paper submitted to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the discovery was more encouragement that the galaxy was full of small-mass planets and that with more time and improved instruments like the Kepler satellite, recently launched by NASA, they would eventually find Earth-like planets in orbits suitable for life around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Finding Earth-like planets with lukewarm temperatures is the next great goal,'' Geoff Marcy, of the University of California, Berkeley, a planet-hunting rival of Dr. Mayor's, said in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the most exciting discovery in exoplanets so far,'' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mayor's group also discovered the first exoplanet, a gas giant 160 times the mass of the Earth, in 1995, using a technique known popularly as the ''wiggle'' method that detects planets by a slight gravitational tug they give their stars. The method is most sensitive to massive planets in close orbits. In a statement, Dr. Mayor noted that the new planet is only one-eightieth of the mass of the first one, saying, ''This is tremendous progress in 14 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery also cements the Gliese system as one of the most promising exoplanet systems. Two years ago, the third planet from that star was hailed as a ''Goldilocks'' planet, where liquid water and thus life might be possible, until calculations showed that the greenhouse effect would broil it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new data also shifted the orbit of the star's outermost planet inward so that it now appears to revolve in the so-called habitable zone where liquid water is possible, according to Stephane Udry of Geneva University, one of the team members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That planet, 581d, is about seven times as massive as the Earth, Dr. Udry explained, which is too big to be just rock. It probably formed as a combination of ice and rock farther out in the Gliese system and then migrated inward, according to various planetary formation models, and melted. He called it the first serious ''water world candidate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planet theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an e-mail message that the Gliese planetary system ''is like the gift that keeps on giving.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of us tend to lose track of space missions, especially unmanned ones. Even a shuttle launch slips by almost unnoticed -- a far cry from the old days when the whole planet paused to watch Gagarin or Shepard or Glenn jump skyward in what now look like pressurized tin cans. Such is the hectic gradualism of modern life. What brings this thought to mind is a new collection of photos from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn since mid-2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What these photographs show is the planet, its moons and its alphabetical rings in many different orientations. Some photographs show Saturn's turbulent surface. Some show disturbances in the rings (made of ice, dust and debris) caused by so-called shepherd moons, whose gravity helps define the edge of a ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the photos were shot at a distance of several hundred thousand miles, but they have a serene and eerie clarity, as if they had been created by computer graphics software. And here is what's surprising: we find ourselves marveling simply at their beauty, not the technical difficulty of capturing the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, we have been looking at images from space for a long time now. We have seen video from the moon. We are accustomed to panoramic snapshots from Mars. Thanks to the Hubble telescope, we have looked back through a knothole in time, into a realm where galaxies are as thick as dust motes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the sort of thing that happens on Earth all the time: humans growing used to what is completely extraordinary. The hard part is grasping the actual -- understanding that Cassini is actually out there, orbiting Saturn some 700 million miles away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has yet to name the person he wants to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In this delay Mr. Obama has company: President George W. Bush did not decide on his choice, Sean O'Keefe, until November of his first year in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA is on the cusp of a once-in-a-generation transition, winding down space shuttle flights and construction of the International Space Station before ramping up ambitions for a return to the moon and an eventual trip to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Michael D. Griffin stepped down as NASA administrator in January, Christopher Scolese, a longtime NASA official, has served in the role on an interim basis. A new NASA boss, however, will arrive at the agency too late to take part in several important decisions. Mr. Scolese and other NASA officials are in the middle of putting together the agency's 2010 budget, which may be unveiled as soon as this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Congress instructed NASA to keep open the possibility of flying the shuttle after 2010. But that mandate expired Thursday, and that day NASA announced the first major round of layoffs among shuttle contractors, about 160 workers, and up to 900 jobs will be eliminated by the end of the fiscal year in September as the agency moves forward on the assumption that there will be, at most, nine flights left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new administrator will also step into a contentious debate over whether development of the next generation of rockets, known as the Constellation program, has gone awry with technical problems or whether it is struggling just because it has received less financing than originally promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constellation managers decided last month to trim the capacity of the new crew capsule, at least initially, from six astronauts to four. The program had been developing two versions -- a six-seater for the space station and Mars and a four-seater for lunar missions -- and managers say the six is not needed for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are considering other major changes in the development of the Ares I, the first of the Constellation rockets, including eliminating one of the test flights to improve the chances of keeping to the schedule of launching the first astronauts in March 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay in naming a top administrator has revived speculation that NASA and space exploration are low priorities for Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An early Obama campaign document in 2007 proposed delaying the Constellation rockets by five years to pay for an education initiative. Mr. Obama later stated that he favored the current goal, devised in the aftermath of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia in 2003, to return to the moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Senate floor last month, Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who is one NASA's primary Congressional champions, said he considered Mr. Obama a strong supporter of the agency. But Mr. Nelson expressed frustration at the lack of a nominee for its top job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA is adrift,'' he said, ''because it doesn't have a vigorous leader, appointed by the Obama administration, to take charge -- someone who understands space flight, who understands management, who understands aeronautics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, a former NASA official and director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said he had ''not much'' concern about the delay, noting that many positions in other parts of the federal government also remain unfilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have a career person who's there who's extremely competent,'' he said of Mr. Scolese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pace said naming an administrator was not urgent, because the Obama administration appeared to agree with the post-Columbia vision for space exploration set forth by the Bush administration that received bipartisan support in Congress. It is ''not as if there's a policy uncertainty,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech to the National Academy of Sciences last week, Mr. Obama made several references to NASA and the exploration of space. But the references were all nostalgic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know, the average age in NASA's mission control during the Apollo 17 mission was just 26,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to the last human visit to the Moon 37 years ago. ''I know that young people today are just as ready to tackle the grand challenges of this century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space exploration was not among Mr. Obama's present-day grand challenges. Other than a quick mention of NASA's role in climate research, he did not talk about what he wanted the space agency to accomplish. He said he would seek to double the budgets for the National Science Foundation, the Energy Department's Office of Science and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. He did not promise more money for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech last month to the National Space Club, Dr. Griffin, the former administrator, said that the Constellation program had received $12 billion less than originally proposed by the Bush administration and that after a slight increase this year, the budget would go down by $3.5 billion over the next four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Funding for lunar return in the Constellation program was already less than $4 billion in the years prior to 2015,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''This was to be allocated to early work on the Ares 5 heavy-lifter, and the Altair lunar lander. With only a half-billion dollars now available, this work cannot be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What NASA will do once it gets back to the Moon may also change. In testimony to a House appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Scolese said the agency might scale back plans for a permanent outpost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new administrator will face the difficult task of juggling the work force, both in NASA and at its contractors, as shuttle workers are laid off before new jobs emerge in the Constellation program. The administrator may also revisit the long-debated question of whether NASA's mission could be better accomplished through more robotic spacecraft like the highly successful Mars rovers rather than much more expensive human space flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the robotic missions, there is a question of looking up at the planets and distant universe versus looking down at Earth. Mr. Obama's budget outline in February proposed a greater emphasis on Earth science.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its second flyby of the planet Mercury last October, NASA's Messenger spacecraft beamed back 1,200 pictures, revealing 30 percent of the planet's surface that had never been seen up close before. Among the images was a view of the second-largest crater on Mercury, as wide as the distance from Boston to Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called the Rembrandt basin -- by convention, Mercurian craters are named after painters, authors, composers and other creative artists -- the crater is surprising more for the geological features within its rim than for its size, planetary scientists said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the terrain inside Rembrandt remains pristine from the time of impact, about 3.9 billion years ago, near the end of the ''heavy bombardment'' period of the early solar system. The basin is young compared with most of the giant ancient impact craters in the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In most large impact basins on Mercury, the Moon and the other inner planets, this terrain is completely buried by volcanic flows erupted after the basin formed,'' Thomas R. Watters, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, said during a NASA news conference last week. Scientists also reported their findings in articles published in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rembrandt's central region where lava did flow, the terrain has deformed into ridges and troughs that radiate outward in a wheel-and-spoke pattern -- ''unlike any we have seen in any other impact basin in the solar system,'' Dr. Watters said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridges form when planetary crust is pressed together, troughs when the crust is pulled apart. Therefore, scientists will have to devise an explanation of how the crust within the Rembrandt basin could have been both pressed together and pulled apart to form the ridges and troughs next to one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another remarkable feature is a line of cliffs 620 miles long that cuts into the Rembrandt crater. Mercury's surface cracked as its interior cooled and shrank, and this fault -- perhaps the longest of these cracks -- shows that Mercury was still shrinking at the time of the impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More globally, Messenger's images indicate that smooth plains, most probably consisting of hardened lava flows, make up 40 percent of the surface, compared with 20 percent on the Earth's Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This indicates that volcanism was a really important process on Mercury,'' said Brett Denevi, a postdoctoral researcher at Arizona State University. ''Which is pretty exciting, because before Messenger's flybys of Mercury, just a year and a half or so ago, we were really not even sure that volcanism existed on Mercury.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that comparison of different terrains suggested that although Mercury was similar to the Moon in appearance, its geological history may have been more like that of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the articles, scientists reported the first detection of magnesium in Mercury's tenuous atmosphere by a Messenger instrument that samples its surroundings. Since much of Mercury's ''air'' consists of molecules knocked off the surface, this discovery helps confirm the presence of magnesium in the crust, which is not a surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What is surprising is the distribution of magnesium,'' said William McClintock of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and a co-investigator of the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hydrogen, helium, sodium, calcium and potassium had been detected before. Calcium and magnesium are similar chemically, and the distribution of the two elements was expected to be similar. Instead, calcium peaked near the equator, while the distribution of magnesium was more uniform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger will make one more flyby of Mercury, on Sept. 29, before entering orbit around the planet in March 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is set to try again to carry out one last long-delayed shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On May 11, if all continues to go well, a crew led by Scott Altman will blast off on the space shuttle Atlantis on an 11-day maintenance and repair mission that they say is the most daunting yet. It will be the last of these voyages that have kept the storied telescope the pride of astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing by on a nearby launching pad in case Atlantis gets in trouble is another shuttle, Endeavour, ready to blast off on a week's notice and pluck the Atlantis astronauts down from the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Altman's crew is armed with 116 new tools built specially for this trip, and a shuttle full of spare parts and new instruments that will take five spacewalks to install. If they succeed, the telescope will be left at the peak of its powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts will not be back. The shuttle is to be retired in 2010, but Hubble should be able to continue sending cosmic postcards until 2014, long enough to overlap in orbit with its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers hope to pull out all the stops for those last five years, which David Leckrone, the Hubble project scientist, calls the ''grand finale of the Hubble symphony.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This mission is a bit of a hallmark for us, not just as a program but as a country,'' LeRoy Cain, NASA's deputy shuttle manager, said at a recent news conference in Houston. ''It's because we have a shuttle vehicle that we can go back and do this final servicing mission that allows us to grow as an exploration community and a space-faring nation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all this sounds familiar that is because it is. NASA has been here before. Commander Altman and his crew were only two weeks from taking off last fall when a router, officially known as the Science Instrument Command &amp; Data Handling System, broke down, rendering all of Hubble's instruments useless. The telescope's engineers realized they could get Hubble back in action by activating a backup circuit, but that would have left the telescope with no backup, one incident away from total failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deciding that it made no sense to spend millions of dollars and send seven astronauts into space just to leave the telescope in such a vulnerable position, NASA postponed the mission until the engineers at Goddard Space Flight Center, could prepare a replacement router.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers and astronauts had already been waiting a long time. In 2004, in the wake of the Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts, Sean O'Keefe, then NASA administrator, canceled the final servicing mission, saying it was too risky. If something happened to the shuttle's fragile thermal tiles during the launching, as it did with Columbia, there was no haven for the astronauts to await rescue. After Michael Griffin took over as the agency's administrator in 2006 and the shuttles started flying again, he reinstated the Hubble repair mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has the political roller coaster ride been? ''I used to have black hair,'' Dr. Leckrone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In place of the space station, Commander Altman and his crew will have Endeavour, which is to be launched on a mission to the space station in June, as a safety backup. For a rescue mission, a skeleton crew led by Chris Ferguson would ''launch on need.'' The astronauts from Atlantis would be transferred along a rope line between the shuttles in a two-day dance of spacewalks and spacesuit swaps. Atlantis carries four suits, none of them big enough for Commander Altman, who takes an extra-large, so Endeavour would have to take him one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Altman, a former Navy captain, will be making his fourth space trip. His pilot, Gregory C. Johnson, also formerly ofthe Navy, is making his first spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traveling as mission specialists will be veterans -- John Grunsfeld, an astronomer on his third Hubble repair trip and fifth shuttle mission, and Mike Massimino, a mechanical engineer making his second Hubble trip -- and rookies Michael Good, an Air Force colonel; Megan McArthur, an oceanographer; and Andrew Feustel, a geologist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Altman, Dr. Grunsfeld and Dr. Massimino were together on the previous Hubble servicing, STS-109, in March 2002. For this mission, Dr. Grunsfeld and Dr. Feustel will be paired on the first, third and fifth spacewalks while Dr. Massimino and Colonel Good will partner on the second and fourth spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino has been Twittering during his training and has some 112,000 followers. At the recent news conference he said he would try to find some time to Twitter a few messages from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McArthur will operate the shuttle's robot arm. She will be the first to grab hold of the telescope when it finally comes into view on the third day of the mission, and, as she pointed out during a news conference last week, she will be the last one to let go of it when the shuttle departs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years of loneliness have taken their toll on the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two of Hubble's scientific instruments are fully functional: the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2, which was installed 16 years ago, and the fine guidance sensors, which measure star positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble's main camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys, lost two of its three channels to mechanical failure in 2006; a spectrograph, known as STIS, failed in 2005; an infrared camera known as Nicmos has not worked since last fall when it was shut down as part of the preparations for the coming servicing mission and then failed to restart, probably because it is clogged with ice crystals. Engineers think they will be able to restart it after the astronauts leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to replacing Hubble's batteries and gyroscopes and the data router, the astronauts will install two new instruments on the telescope. They will replace the old wide-field camera with the Wide-Field Camera 3. And they will install the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph in place of a set of corrective lenses called Costar that astronauts installed in 1993 to correct Hubble's original flawed vision. All the instruments added since that first servicing mission include corrective optics, so Costar is no longer needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that is routine, as far as spacewalk tasks go. A more daunting job will be to repair the STIS spectrograph and the Advanced Camera, neither of which was designed to be worked on in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any problem?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hubble needs a hug,'' said Dr. Grunsfeld, ''and we're ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: A Final Visit: Astronauts aboard the shuttle Atlantis are scheduled to begin a fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope next week. They will make repairs and install new science instruments, extending the19-year-old telescope's useful life and enhancing its scientific capabilities.(Sources: NASA; Space Telescope Science Institute)(DRAWING BY FRANK O'CONNELL/THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is perhaps fitting that a NASA satellite to carry yeast into orbit has roughly the shape and dimensions of a bread box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tiny 10-pound satellite known as PharmaSat will be hitching a ride aboard an Air Force Minotaur 1 rocket next to the main payload, a military reconnaissance satellite. Liftoff is scheduled for Thursday from a launching pad at Wallops Island in Virginia, after being postponed by weather Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the yeast cells will be comfortable space tourists inside PharmaSat's microlaboratory, orbiting the Earth at a speed of 17,000 miles per hour and a height of 285 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then an antifungal drug will be injected into some of the yeast compartments, and instruments will measure how the yeast respond. Previous experiments on the space shuttle and the International Space Station indicate that some organisms become hardier and more virulent in outer space and more resistant to drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing if we can quantify the effect,'' said Elwood Agasid, the mission's project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., which developed the satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weightlessness might be changing how the drug reacts within the cells, or it might be switching on and off certain genes, resulting in greater resistance. Such effects will become of more concern to astronauts on longer-duration space flights like a mission to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeast is used often for studying fundamental biological questions. On PharmaSat, the experiment will end after four days, and all of the yeast cells will die, probably within a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called nanosatellites like PharmaSat allow NASA to perform simple space experiments more quickly and cheaply than would be possible on the space station or a larger satellite. The entire cost of PharmaSat, including design, construction and operation of the satellite, is $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA first launched a nanosatellite, GeneSat-1, in 2006. Experiments on that satellite showed that keeping E. coli bacteria alive in a space microlaboratory was feasible. A future Ames-built nanosatellite, scheduled for launching next year, will look at how well biological building blocks and microbes survive when directly exposed to the radiation, vacuum and other rigors of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will help test the idea that precursors of biological molecules rained down from the sky onto early Earth. By looking at how well microbes can survive in space, scientists can better evaluate a hypothesis that life may have first arisen on Mars and then was carried to Earth on a meteorite.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration announced Thursday that an independent panel would take a ''fresh look'' at NASA's human spaceflight program, a step that could lead to the scuttling of next-generation rockets or an affirmation of the agency's direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review will be led by Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin who led a major review of the space program in 1990. The panel will consist of about 10 members appointed by Christopher Scolese, the acting NASA administrator, after consultation with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They will represent experienced leaders in spaceflight and related fields,'' said Michael Cabbage, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel is to report its findings by the end of August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a presentation Thursday unveiling details of President Obama's budget on science research and development, the president's science adviser, John P. Holdren, said the panel would look at ''the options that we have going forward to confront the mix of challenges and opportunities we face in that very important program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges, Dr. Holdren said, included extending the life of the International Space Station beyond 2015, reviewing NASA's strategy for returning to the Moon by 2020 and managing the upheaval to the work force in the space industry as the shuttle program winds down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's proposed $18.7 billion budget for NASA affirms plans to retire the three space shuttles by September 2010. Nine missions are left: one next week to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, and eight to complete the International Space Station. Officials said they could accomplish all of the flights on the current schedule but indicated that if necessary the flights could be allowed to slip into 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The commitment is to complete those nine flights,'' Mr. Scolese said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, NASA has worked on two rockets, Ares I and Ares V, to replace the space shuttles. But the development of the Ares I has encountered technical challenges and budget constraints, and critics have said other approaches, including adapting existing Atlas V and Delta IV rockets, would be cheaper and quicker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I is to carry astronauts to the space station beginning in March 2015, but NASA faces much skepticism over whether the target can be met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, if we're on the wrong path, we should change,'' Mr. Scolese said. ''If you're asking me do I think we're on the wrong path, no, I don't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has spent $6.9 billion to develop the new rockets. During the review, work on the Ares I will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's spending plans would provide $630 million more for development work in 2010 and 2011 than what President George W. Bush requested last year. After the retirement of the shuttles, spending under Mr. Obama's plan for the Ares rockets, and an Orion crew capsule, from 2011 to 2013 would sharply rise but would be $3.75 billion less than what Mr. Bush had proposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget sets a more Earthward focus for NASA, with large increases for aeronautics and earth sciences like climate change.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Seven astronauts blasted off for one last dance with the Hubble Space Telescope on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Atlantis, commanded by Scott D. Altman, bolted through the sky on a pillar of smoke and fire just after 2 p.m. Monday. Atlantis is carrying 22,000 pounds of custom-designed tools, replacement parts and new instruments to slice and dice starlight as well as the hearts of scientists and stargazers everywhere. It is rushing toward a Wednesday rendezvous with the telescope, which happened to be floating about 350 miles directly above Cape Canaveral at launching time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well, in five spacewalks starting Thursday morning, the crew members will revamp and refresh the telescope, which has dazzled the public and the science community with its iconic cosmic postcards. Then they will say goodbye on behalf of humanity forever. Sometime in the middle of the next decade, the Hubble will run out of juice, and it will eventually be crashed into the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Commander Altman, the crew includes Gregory C. Johnson, as pilot, and John M. Grunsfeld, Michael J. Massimino, Michael T. Good, Andrew J. Fuestel and K. Megan McArthur, as mission specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis astronauts will spend Tuesday examining the shuttle with cameras looking for any dings or nicks or holes caused by flying debris during the launching. The shuttle Columbia was doomed in 2003 because a hunk of insulating foam broke off the external fuel tank and damaged the tiles that protected the spacecraft from the searing heat of re-entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts carry a tool kit for fixing small holes or cracks in the fragile tiles. If there is something they cannot fix, they will hunker down and await the shuttle Endeavour, which is sitting on another launching pad, ready to blast off with a four-man crew and retrieve the Atlantis astronauts from danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sad thing is if we get to orbit and see something bad and get waved off and don't get to fix Hubble,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''That would be the saddest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, Endeavour would have to bring a spacesuit for Commander Altman, who takes an extra-large that is not stocked on Atlantis. The two most experienced spacewalkers on Atlantis, Dr. Grunsfeld and Dr. Massimino, would then escort their shipmates along a rope to the Endeavour in a two-day dance of swapping spacesuits that would include a sleepover for Dr. Grunsfeld on the Endeavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of changes to the design of the fuel tank that make it less likely to sustain major damage during launching, the bigger risk this time around comes from micrometeoroids and space junk, which is more prevalent at Hubble's altitude and orbit than at the lower space station. There is about a 1 in 229 chance of a catastrophic collision, so the astronauts will take another close look at their craft at the end of the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight comes as NASA is once again at a crossroads. The agency lacks a permanent administrator; Christopher Scolese has been acting administrator since Michael D. Griffin stepped down in January, and the White House is said to have been having trouble finding a candidate who can pass various forms of muster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has begun laying off workers as part of the decision to retire the shuttles next year. Last week, President Obama ordered a review of the agency's long-heralded plan to return humans to the Moon and of the Constellation spacecraft that are to succeed the shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if it is the beginning of the last act for the Hubble, the flight Monday also marks the beginning of the end for the space shuttle, whose greatest legacy might very well be the role it played in the repair and maintenance of the Hubble, what Commander Altman recently called ''an incredible example of how humans and machines can work together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld, who has earned the sobriquet of ''Hubble repairman'' for his previous exploits in space with the telescope, said: ''The only reason Hubble works is because we have a space shuttle. And of all things we do, I think Hubble is probably the best thing we use it for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mario Livio, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute, put it, ''It's not just a telescope, it's the people's telescope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis is scheduled to rendezvous with the Hubble on Wednesday, latch it down in the shuttle cargo bay and take a good look at it with the robot arm and cameras. The engineers say they will not be surprised to find flapping insulation blankets or micrometeorite hits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it's been seven years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Periodic maintenance visits by astronauts have been the lifeblood of the Hubble telescope ever since it was launched in 1990 from the shuttle. Floating above the murky atmosphere, the telescope was designed to see the stars with peerless precision. It was hailed as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, until astronomers discovered shortly after its launching that it couldn't be focused because its mirror had been exquisitely polished to the wrong shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a dramatic series of spacewalks in 1993, astronauts fitted Hubble with corrective lenses, restoring its vision and NASA's pride. In the years since, astronauts have visited three more times, improving the telescope's capability and cosmic reach by yanking old instruments, putting in new ones and performing other tasks -- many of which were not originally meant to be performed by astronauts wearing the equivalent of boxing gloves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Atlantis mission that began Monday, astronauts for the first time will be opening instruments and replacing circuit boards in space. The last maintenance mission was in March 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually every important part of the telescope, except the warped mirror itself, has been replaced over the last 19 years. The result, astronomers say, is that the telescope today is 100 times as powerful as the one they thought they were putting in orbit back in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, astronomers used Hubble to record the deepest optical and infrared images ever made, showing galaxies forming in the primordial mist only 800 million years after the Big Bang. Before it conked out due to electrical problems in 2007, Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys took one of the first ever images of a planet around another star, a dot orbiting Fomalhaut, and it had become the foremost instrument on or near the Earth for investigating dark energy, the strange effect that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another instrument, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, or STIS, made the first identification of ingredients in the atmosphere of a planet around another star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has not come cheaply. NASA estimates that the Hubble telescope has cost about $10 billion over the last 30 years, including the cost of five shuttle servicing missions. For this expense, however, the public has gotten a lot more than just a bunch of cosmic postcards and cosmic inspiration, astronomers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pictures, pretty as they are, are also precise, said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, ticking off a number of issues, like the size of the universe or the prevalence of monster black holes in the centers of galaxies. Phenomena that astronomers used to almost come to blows arguing about have now been settled by Hubble measurements, often in conjunction with other telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the numbers not the pictures that are Hubble's real legacy value,'' Dr. Mountain said. ''Hubble is taken as a gold standard, and we make sure it is a gold standard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Weiler, head of space science for NASA who has been involved with Hubble his entire career, called it ''the most successful scientific instrument ever built,'' one that people would remember for 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle Columbia broke up during re-entry in 2003, killing all seven astronauts on board, then NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that the Hubble missions were too risky because they offered no haven if the shuttle arrived in orbit too damaged to get back to Earth. That would have left the iconic telescope to the mercy of the solar winds, resulting in an early death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Keefe's edict was reversed by Michael Griffin, who succeeded him as administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle commander, Scott D. Altman, and his crew were 17 days from blasting off last fall, when a router that controls all the telescope's instruments and data failed, shutting Hubble down. Engineers on the ground resuscitated the router by activating a backup electrical channel on the telescope, but rather than send astronauts all the way to space in order to leave the telescope with no further backup should the other side of the router fail, NASA postponed the already long-delayed mission until a replacement router could be readied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Grunsfeld, who will be one of four spacewalkers on the mission, said he and the rest of the crew had used the extra time wisely, practicing removing tiny screws ''over and over again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, as the morning before launching wore on, old Hubble veterans could hardly believe that their long-delayed reunion was finally going to happen. ''Maybe our time has come,'' Mike Weiss, a Goddard engineer, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Livio said, ''I'll feel better once they are up,'' referring to the astronauts, ''and even better once they have finished.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Keefe, the former administrator who cancelled this mission on the grounds that it was too risky back in 2004, was here in a black STS-125 polo shirt and said he had no regrets about doing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Time,'' he said, ''is the best analyst I ever met,'' explaining that at the time, the shuttles had not started flying again and no diagnostic or repair capabilities had been devised. He said that he found it very satisfying to be here ''to observe an event that I never thought would be possible,'' calling it a testimony to ''the incredible persistence of the NASA community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problematic router is scheduled to be replaced during the first spacewalk along with the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2, which has been on the telescope since 1993 and is currently the only operating instrument on Hubble. In its place will be the new Wide-Field Camera 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the second day the astronauts will install the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph in place of Hubble's original corrective lenses, which are no longer needed. The spectrograph is designed to investigate an invisible ''cosmic web'' of dark matter and primordial gas that is thought to stretch like tendrils through space connecting galaxies and in which most of the atoms in the universe are thought to reside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More dicey and uncertain are the plans on the third and fourth days to attempt to repair the advanced camera and the imaging spectrograph, partly because these instruments were not designed to be opened in space and partly because the engineers, especially in the case of the camera, have had to do instrument forensics from 350 miles away and don't know for sure what went wrong inside of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't hold us to too high a standard,'' Dr. Weiler, the Hubble old-timer, said.. ''That's a heck of a challenge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it all works, said Preston Burch, Hubble program manager at Goddard, the reborn Hubble would return as much data in the next six months as it did in the first eight years of its life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even without the advanced camera and the spectrograph, said Jon Morse, head of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, if the other more routine things get done, Hubble will be ''an outstanding observatory doing world-class science.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1:14 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, as the space shuttle Atlantis and the space telescope sailed over western Australia, the shuttle's robot arm, with mission specialist Megan McArthur at the controls, reached out, oh so slowly, and grabbed the telescope.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a gadget that has not been tended for more than seven years, Hubble did not look bad at all, at least on first examination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just looking out the window here, and it's an unbelievably beautiful sight. Amazingly, the exterior of Hubble, an old man of 19 years in space, still looks in fantastic shape,'' said John Grunsfeld, the veteran astronaut and Hubble repairman who was the last to see Hubble in March 2002 and who arguably knows the telescope better than anyone on or above the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the fifth and last of the servicing missions that have kept the Hubble Space Telescope alive and getting better.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just looking out the window here, and it's an unbelievably beautiful sight,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, a veteran astronaut. ''Amazingly, the exterior of Hubble, an old man of 19 years in space, still looks in fantastic shape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld, who is on his third Hubble repair trip, was one of the last humans to see the telescope in March 2002 and arguably knows it better than anyone on or above Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, director of astrophysics for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, working his first Hubble mission at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said, ''I was really blown away seeing the telescope up close on the screen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was about an hour later, as the shuttle approached the coast of Africa, that Dr. McArthur wrestled the telescope into its berth on a kind of lazy susan in the back of the shuttle cargo bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation was slowed by a communication glitch between the shuttle and the telescope; astronauts could send commands to the telescope to shut off its gyros, among other things, to ease its capture, but they could not tell if the commands had been received and obeyed. That information instead had to be relayed through the telescope's control room at the Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the fifth and last of the servicing missions that have repaired, refurbished and reinvented the venerable telescope over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center exactly on time and almost completely cleanly Monday afternoon, suffering a few nicks along a 21-inch stretch of tiles where the shuttle's starboard wing meets its body. After a crew of experts studied photos of the area Tuesday night, mission managers announced that the damage was minor and would not require further study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, a little after 8 a.m., Dr. Grunsfeld and the mission specialist Andrew J. Feustel plan to embark on the first of five spacewalks scheduled over the next five days. They will be giving the Hubble telescope a new set of eyes, the Wide-Field Camera 3, and a new data router to replace one that failed last fall, postponing the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have also been asked to photograph some fine particulate matter on the cover of the container holding the new camera, perhaps shaken loose during launching. Mission managers want to make sure that no contamination of the camera itself happens when the cover is opened.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the space shuttle Atlantis, which grabbed hold of the Hubble Space Telescope on Wednesday, wind up parked on a pier in the Hudson River five blocks from Times Square? That is the pie in the sky for the operators of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Museum officials have taken the first small step toward acquiring one of the three space shuttles that NASA plans to hand off when the shuttle program ends next year. They are enlisting support from elected officials and former astronauts for their idea of adding a decommissioned shuttle to the Intrepid's eclectic collection of military aircraft, a Mercury space capsule, a submarine and a Concorde passenger jet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They dream of housing the shuttle in a glass enclosure on the end of Pier 86 at 46th Street on the West Side of Manhattan, home to the Intrepid since 1982. But they have plenty of competition from museums around the country, including the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have never shied away from competition or a challenge,'' said Bill White, president of the foundation that operates the Intrepid museum. ''This is very important to us, and it would just be an extraordinary, priceless treasure for New York City to receive. You're going to see a very public campaign for this in the next few months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid museum was one of 20 institutions that responded by a March 17 deadline to ask NASA about its plan to give away the last of the shuttles: Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis. The space agency estimates the cost of preparing and delivering them at $42 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Smithsonian has already notified NASA of its interest in the oldest of the shuttles, Discovery, but considers the cost prohibitive, said Michael J. Neufeld, chairman of the Smithsonian's space history division. ''Our official position is we don't have the money to pay for the costs at all,'' Dr. Neufeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Intrepid officials told NASA that they were confident of their ability to raise the money from public and private sources by the time NASA is ready to deliver a shuttle. Mr. White pointed out that the estimated cost -- which he said he believed could be brought down significantly -- was less than half of the $115 million the Intrepid raised for the recent overhaul of its pier. The Intrepid Foundation has also raised $120 million to build facilities for injured war veterans and their families, Mr. White added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some officials of other museums said they considered the Intrepid a long shot for landing a shuttle over institutions devoted to aviation, like the Museum of Flight in Seattle and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio. But Mr. White said the Intrepid would be an appropriate home because of its role in recovering returning astronauts during the Mercury rocket program and because of its location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White said he believed the shuttle could draw as many as a million visitors to the Intrepid and contribute to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's goal of attracting 50 million visitors to the city annually by 2015. George A. Fertitta, the chief executive of NYC &amp; Company, the city's tourism promotion agency, agreed. ''Any time you can add something new and as exciting as having the shuttle here, that will be an additional draw,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it expected to have the shuttles ready for display by early 2012, after they are cleared of all toxic chemicals and hazardous materials. NASA plans to ferry them on the back of a <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 747 airliner to airports near the museums chosen to receive them, said Mike Curie, a spokesman for the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Curie said the agency had not developed a procedure for deciding where the shuttles will go. After analyzing the responses from the 20 institutions, he said, NASA officials will decide whether to issue a formal request for proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis, which took off on Monday to repair the Hubble telescope, and the two other active shuttles are scheduled to fly missions through September 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White said the Intrepid museum was interested in obtaining any of them. ''We are singularly focused on getting a shuttle here to the Intrepid,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A newly launched NASA telescope has begun scanning the cosmos for Earth-like planets. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said that the Kepler spacecraft would spend the next three and a half years staring nonstop at 100,000 stars in a remote patch of the Milky Way for potentially habitable planets. The start of Kepler's science mission comes two months after it rocketed from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Engineers have been busy calibrating the craft for its job. The mission costs $600 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble Space Telescope got new eyes and a new nervous system on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took all of the astronaut Andrew J. Feustel's experience as a mechanic and an old Jaguar restorer, however, to accomplish the eyeball part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task on a five-day set of repair and maintenance spacewalks from the space shuttleAtlantis was to install a new camera, the Wide-Field Camera 3, on the Hubble. But to get it in, astronauts first had to remove the old camera by unscrewing a seven-foot bolt known as the ''A'' latch, which was last moved in 1993 when astronauts on the first Hubble servicing mission installed the camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first , the latch did not want to move. For about an hour, Dr. Feustel, working on the end of the robot arm, tried a variety of computer-controlled wrenches and settings, while John M. Grunsfeld, mission specialist, floated about fetching tools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, mission controllers gave Dr. Feustel permission to apply as much muscle as he wanted, even if the balky bolt broke. If that happened, the old camera, which has performed flawlessly for almost 16 years, would have to stay in the telescope and the new $126 million camera would have to go home -- not a great start to the servicing mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bolt finally budged and then turned freely. ''Woo hoo, it's moving out,'' Dr. Feustel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's been there for 16 years,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Feustel replied, ''And it didn't want to come out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour later, as the Atlantis was sailing over the southwest Pacific, Dr. Feustel was sliding the new camera into the telescope and latching it down. Controllers from the ground reported that the camera had passed electrical tests and was ''alive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new camera's features is the ability to record images in the normally invisible ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelength bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as visible light. The infrared capability extends the Hubble's reach into the past because the expansion of the universe stretches the wavelengths of light from distant galaxies to longer, redder wavelengths, and thus a little further back in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's adventure began about 9 a.m. when Dr. Grunsfeld slithered out of the airlock into the cargo bay of the Atlantis in front of an audience watching on NASA TV. He was followed about seven minutes later by Dr. Feustel, who was making his first spacewalk and pronounced the experience ''fantastic.'' Dr. Grunsfeld was embarking on his sixth spacewalk, all of them devoted to working on the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having installed new eyes, the spacewalkers turned to replacing a data router that died last September, leaving the telescope in essence unable to hear or speak. It has been running on a backup channel since the fall. Dr. Feustel tried to install a set of three latches on the telescope's doors to make it easier to get in on the next spacewalks, but that did not go so well (only two of the three latches were installed) and Dr. Grunsfeld had to fetch a repair kit for one balky bolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a day of surprises,'' Michael J. Massimino, mission specialist, said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was sayonara on Thursday for Hubble's only working instrument, the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2, which has been on the telescope since 1993, the longest of any of Hubble's instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day before Monday's shuttle launching, astronomers and mission engineers held a sort of retirement party for the camera, calling it ''the camera that saved Hubble twice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time was when it was installed, on the dramatic first servicing mission in 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena were already at work on a backup for Hubble's original camera, the Wide-Field Planetary camera, or ''wiff pick,'' when it was discovered soon after Hubble's launching in 1990 that the telescope's main mirror had blurred vision because of a warp known as spherical aberration. Hubble went overnight from being the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo to literally a cosmic joke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the experts at J.P.L. realized that they could correct for Hubble's aberration by modifying four nickel-size mirrors in their camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, engineers at the Space Telescope Science Institute figured out a way to install a package of corrective lenses, called Costar, that would unfold in the telescope and unblur the light destined for the rest of Hubble's original instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When these devices were installed on orbit in December 1993, the cosmos snapped into razor focus. In 1995, the new camera took what is probably the most famous of Hubble's cosmic postcards, ''Pillars of Creation,'' of star-birthing clouds in the Eagle nebula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second time the wide-field camera saved Hubble was in 2007 when the Advanced Camera for Surveys, which had become the telescope's workhorse, suffered an electrical failure. The wide-field camera stepped back into the gap. For the last six months it has been the only fully working instrument on the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the camera has made 135,000 observations, which have been the fodder for 3,500 scientific papers, according to Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the wide-field camera and Costar, which is be removed Saturday, are destined for the Smithsonian. Costar is no longer needed because everything that has been installed on Hubble over the last 16 years includes its own corrective optics; it will be replaced by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, with which astronomers hope to trace a ''cosmic web'' of gas and dark matter that stretches through the universe connecting galaxies like knots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the retirement party, the story was told of how Dan Goldin, then NASA's administrator, paid a visit to the camera team. When he asked what was going on, he was told that they were getting ready to fix the Hubble telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldin's response, so the story goes, was, ''No, you are here to save the agency.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles F. Bolden Jr., a former space shuttle astronaut and retired Marine major general, is the leading candidate for nomination as the next administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether an announcement of a nominee would be coming on Monday, the White House secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Friday, ''I think you know that the president will meet with somebody that he hopes will -- wants to meet with somebody about filling the important role of future NASA administrator.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gibbs then confirmed that General Bolden was the person Mr. Obama would be interviewing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He will meet with him on Monday, and we'll see how that goes,'' Mr. Gibbs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NBC News first reported the likely nomination of General Bolden on Thursday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nominated and confirmed by the Senate, General Bolden would become the first African-American to head NASA. He would begin work as the agency undergoes a major transition, finishing construction of the International Space Station in the next year and a half and then retiring its three space shuttles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But General Bolden's past connections with the space industry could conflict with ethics policies that would appear to prohibit him from taking part in the central decisions regarding NASA's manned space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I -- the first of the next-generation rockets on the drawing board, part of what NASA calls its Constellation program -- has come under criticism as underpowered and too expensive. The Obama administration announced a week ago that an independent panel that would consider other approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After retiring from the military in August 2004, General Bolden, 62, worked as a lobbyist for ATK, which manufactures the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle and what is to be the first stage of the Ares I. More recently, he was on the board of directors of <span class="companylink">Gencorp Inc</span>., which owns <span class="companylink">Aerojet</span>, a company that has a contract to build engines for the Orion capsule that is to ride on top of the Ares I rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden stepped down from the Gencorp board in March last year, but an executive order on ethics by Mr. Obama states that appointees cannot take part in matters ''directly and substantially related'' to their former employers for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berin Szoka, a fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a Washington research organization, said that if the ethics policy were consistently applied, General Bolden would recuse himself from issues that could affect Gencorp, and those would essentially include the entire Constellation program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Aerojet</span> also makes the strap-on solid rocket boosters for the Atlas V rocket, which has been promoted as a potential alternative to the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, has been pushing for General Bolden for the top NASA position. Mr. Nelson said last month that NASA needed an administrator familiar with all facets of the agency and who had experience in management. ''I think that is uniquely found in the person of General Bolden,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selected by NASA as an astronaut in 1980, General Bolden flew on four space shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s, the first two as pilot, the second two as commander, including a flight in which Mr. Nelson was a member of his crew. General Bolden left NASA in 1994 and returned to the Marines, where he rose to the rank of major general.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts aboard the space shuttleAtlantis on Friday accomplished the most important task of their 11-day mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, replacing the gyroscopes that keep the telescope pointed in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission specialists Col. Michael T. Good and Michael J. Massimino also replaced three of the observatory's batteries in the second of five planned spacewalks before humans leave the Hubble forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the day's work was not easy. Hampered by a balky gyro unit that would not fit into its receptacle and had to be replaced by a spare, Dr. Massimino and Colonel Good, running low on oxygen and spacesuit power, fell two hours behind schedule. The extra work lengthened the spacewalk by an hour and a half, to eight hours, making it the 10th longest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino emerged from the airlock to begin the day around 9 a.m. Eastern time as Atlantis crossed over North Africa. Colonel Good, a former Air Force test pilot, followed him. Dr. Massimino offered a greeting, saying, ''Welcome to the wonderful world of working in a vacuum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino, formerly a mechanical and robotics engineer, was making his third spacewalk, all devoted to the Hubble. Colonel Good was making his first trip to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their agenda involved some of the infrastructure that keeps the Hubble running: replacing all six of the gyroscopes that keep it pointed in the right direction and three of the telescope's six batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes only three gyros -- one for each direction in space -- to keep the Hubble on target, but the gyros, which come in units of two, have had a habit of failing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The batteries, which charge from solar panels in the daylight and discharge when the Hubble is in the dark, were working well, but they had been in space for 19 years, and engineers decided it was prudent to change them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work on Friday was delicate. To replace the gyros, Dr. Massimino and Colonel Good had to go inside the telescope and avoid banging into anything as they disconnected and unscrewed the old gyros and put in the new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By around 10:30 a.m., the first of the new units had been installed, and ground controllers announced that it was ''alive.'' But the second unit would not go into place on its receptor. ''It feels like there is a bump underneath,'' Dr. Massimino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts gave up on that unit and fetched the third one, which fit nicely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next they tried the balky unit on the third and last receptacle, but it would not fit there either. So they fetched a spare. At first it did not fit either, but after some fiddling, Colonel Good got it into place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congratulating his men, the shuttle's commander, Scott D. Altman, jokingly quoted King Leonidas of Sparta, who held off the Persians at Thermopylae 2,500 years ago. ''Remember this day, men,'' Commander Altman said, ''for it will be yours for all time.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by The Associated Press in the World Briefing column last Saturday about the European Space Agency's launch of the Herschel space telescope erroneously attributed a distinction to the telescope.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what was all the fuss about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two days of tense spacewalks drawn out by balky bolts and badly fitting equipment, the astronauts aboard the space shuttleAtlantis on Saturday breezed through the trickiest and most delicate job of their 11-day mission to the Hubble Space Telescope: fixing a camera that had not been designed to be repaired in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working as calmly as if they were in shirt sleeves in the basement rather than wearing the equivalent of boxing gloves and sailing through space at five miles per second, John M. Grunsfeld and Andrew J. Feustel conducted ''brain surgery'' on the Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. They unscrewed screws not meant to be unscrewed and yanked circuit boards, finishing in less than three hours a job that had been allotted nearly five hours and two spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most optimistic members of the team had warned that repairing the camera was a long shot. Dr. Grunsfeld, already respected for his Hubble fix-it endeavors on two earlier missions, said before the flight that this would be a nail-biter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he began to remove screws almost an hour ahead of schedule, gasps and cheers broke out in the cabin of Atlantis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think real brain surgeons say '<span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>' every time they pull something out,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe they should,'' replied Col. Michael T. Good of the Air Force, who was orchestrating events from inside Atlantis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day's success raised the repair team's confidence that it would succeed on Sunday, when similar surgery will be tried on another ailing instrument, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was, as Scott D. Altman, the shuttle's commander, said Saturday morning as the astronauts set out, ''a great day for a spacewalk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld was on his second spacewalk of this mission and his seventh over all, every one in the name of the Hubble. Dr. Feustel was making his second spacewalk. On Thursday, the pair overcame a stuck bolt to replace the most ancient of the Hubble's cameras, the wide-field camera No. 2, with a new version.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld and Dr. Feustel warmed up for the main event by installing on the Hubble a new spectrograph, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spectrographs break down light into its constituent wavelengths, allowing astronomers to discern the composition, temperature and motions of celestial objects. The Hubble's astronomers hope to use the instrument to trace tendrils of gas that stretch through the universe like a spider web, connecting galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new spectrograph went into a slot occupied for the last 16 years by a box of corrective lenses known as the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement system. When it was installed in the space telescope in 1993, it provided special lenses that folded like a shower rod and took the blur out of the Hubble's flawed vision. But all of the Hubble's instruments now have their own correction optics, and Costar is headed for the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advanced camera was a workhorse until its demise in 2007, with some of the Hubble's most famous pictures to its credit, including the one in 2004 called Ultra Deep Field, which showed galaxies forming only 800 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers were planning three hours' worth of tests overnight to make sure the camera was repaired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it conked out in 2007, engineers said it was unlikely that the camera could be fixed. Not only was it not designed to be taken apart by astronauts wearing boxing gloves, and some parts of it were inaccessible, but the astronauts already had their hands full training to repair a spectrograph that had also not been designed to be tinkered with in space. That work will be the highlight of the spacewalk on Sunday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just give it a whack. Sometimes, it seems, even in the highest of high-tech circles, there is no substitute for good old brute force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question aboard the space shuttleAtlantis on Sunday was whether Michael J. Massimino would rock a handrail on the Hubble Space Telescope back and forth to fatigue a stripped bolt that was stubbornly holding it, or just give the rail a big yank to break it and the bolt off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the rail were 111 screws. Beyond the screws were the internal electronics of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, the intended object of ''brain surgery'' on the fourth of five days of spacewalks meant to repair and upgrade the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectrograph, which has been used to measure the masses of giant black holes in galactic centers and identify the constituents in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another star, shut down in 2004 because of a short circuit in its power supply. It was not designed to be opened up and worked on in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, for the last three years, engineers and astronauts had been preparing a procedure to break into the instrument, capture all the screws and fix the power supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first the spacewalkers, Dr. Massimino and Col. Michael T. Good of the Air Force, had to get the handrail off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the third of four spacewalks in this mission, the last to the 19-year-old telescope, to be stymied by low-tech problems like bad bolts. Meanwhile, trickier jobs, like the repair on Saturday of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, have gone smoothly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of the handrail bolts came off easily, but Dr. Massimino could not get traction with his drill on the fourth bolt head. After fussing with the bolt and then retrieving a sharper drill bit from the airlock, he asked, ''What's Plan C?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a review of the yanking procedures led by Scott D. Altman, the shuttle's commander, Dr. Massimino said he would probably rock the rail back and forth once and then go for broke. As it happened, the shuttle passed out of television range of mission control and an interplanetary audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's off,'' Dr. Massimino reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Riess, a heavy Hubble user at the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University who was watching on NASA TV, wrote in an e-mail message: ''We always joke that they wait until they are out of TV view to use the hammers and crowbars.'' He added, ''I guess they really do!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts struggled to get back to their script, and they finally completed the repair about two hours behind schedule. Informed that the spectrograph had passed an initial ''aliveness test,'' whoops and cheers could be heard from the Atlantis crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was slightly different news from the ground about the camera repair done on Saturday; engineers reported after overnight tests that it was not quite as successful as they had hoped. The on-orbit work restored the camera's ability to take wide-field images but so far has failed to restore its ability to take high-resolution pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the wide-field channel of the advanced camera is overwhelmingly the favorite of astronomers, the mission engineers still consider the operation a huge success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Riess, who has used the advanced camera to study the so-called dark energy that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe, said, ''I would consider it an unmitigated success if we do get only the wide-field channel back online.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no crying in space, but Monday was perhaps as close as it gets to a blubberfest in space helmets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he headed into the airlock of the space shuttleAtlantis after the fifth and final spacewalk to tune up the Hubble Space Telescope, the astronaut and astronomer John M. Grunsfeld paused to pay tribute to the telescope and the human spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hubble is not just a satellite,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''It's a symbol of humanity's quest for knowledge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quoting Arthur C. Clarke, the author and space visionary, he continued, ''The only way to find the limits of the possible is by going past them into the impossible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld's crewmates chimed in with praise for one another and the engineers, astronomers and trainers back on Earth who had made it all possible. ''Drew, you're an incredible spacewalking partner,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said at one point, referring to Andrew J. Feustel, a mission specialist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Grunsfeld, it was not just the end of a mission, but the end of a career. Through 10 years and eight spacewalks that total 58 hours, placing him fourth on history's spacewalking list, he has been the telescope's repairman, the only astronomer who has both observed with the Hubble and touched it in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not a role he took to easily. Once upon a time, before he became an astronaut, Dr. Grunsfeld admitted, he was not so keen on the Hubble telescope. As a high-energy astrophysicist not involved in classical optical astronomy, he said, ''I kind of resented Hubble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said in a recent interview, ''That was a pretty ignorant position I was in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, he told a distinguished panel of scientists pondering the future of the space telescope that it was worth risking his life for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hubble is arguably the most important scientific instrument ever created,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''And, you know, those are pretty strong words, and I think they're probably true.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But astronauts will not be back to the telescope, and Dr. Grunsfeld has said this was his last spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of his last day as a spacewalker was about as free from drama as anything can be while floating 350 miles above Earth. Dr. Grunsfeld and Dr. Feustel got an early start and sped through their first tasks, finishing the replacement of the telescope's batteries and installing a refurbished star tracker an hour early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their reward was to replace several of the telescope's old insulating blankets, which were falling apart, with sturdier cookie-sheets. So Dr. Grunsfeld spent some of the last moments of his Hubble career up on the end of the robot arm peeling old disintegrating insulation off the side of the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was done, he spent some time taking pictures. ''This is a beautiful spaceship,'' he said at one point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Feustel, a geophysicist, threw his head back once at the end of the day to marvel at the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as it turned out, they were not quite done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the sort of low comedic twist that you would not dare make up, Dr. Grunsfeld brushed an antenna on the telescope with his foot while he was chasing a piece of debris and knocked a cap off the end. Upon verifying that it was the end of the antenna, he said, ''I'm sick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope controllers on the ground quickly determined that the antenna was still working fine. Dan Burbank in mission control told the disconsolate-sounding Dr. Grunsfeld: ''Just to let you know, we're feeling real good about this. We think that antenna's going to be just fine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after his goodbye speech, Dr. Grunsfeld was directed back out to the telescope to put a cover on it to provide some insulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gave him one last moment to hug the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sorry, Mr. Hubble,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Have a good voyage.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three crew members of the International Space Station raised plastic pouches in a toast of their first taste of urine that had been recycled into drinkable water. ''The taste is great,'' said Michael R. Barratt, a flight engineer. A recycling system, installed last fall, purifies the urine. Recycling is crucial, especially with the station crew expanding to six people this month, because of the cost of transporting water from Earth. At the station's mission control room in Houston, people cheered and drank similarly recycled water. A distillation unit in the system initially proved balky, and a replacement was brought up and installed in March. After the system passed tests, the station's two astronauts and one cosmonaut finally took a sip.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with another day of bad weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida but hopeful of better weather on Sunday, NASA for the second day in a row called off all attempts to land the space shuttleAtlantis and its seven astronauts on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis will land at either Kennedy or Edwards Air Force Base in California on Sunday, the space agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landing conditions are fine at the backup landing site at Edwards, but NASA prefers to land at the shuttle's home port in Florida to save time and money in getting the shuttle ready for its next flight in August. Since Atlantis has plenty of provisions to last until Monday, the agency said it would give the Florida landing another try Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first chance to land at Kennedy will be 10:11 a.m. Eastern time. The second chance will be 11:49 a.m. Landing opportunities at Edwards happen about 10 minutes earlier on each orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts, commanded by Scott D. Altman, are trying to get home from what has now been a 12-day mission, on which they overhauled the Hubble Space Telescope one last time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House announced on Saturday the nomination of Charles F. Bolden Jr., a former space shuttle astronaut and Marine general, to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the decision, said the announcement was timed to take advantage of the attention paid to the current mission of the space shuttle Atlantis; its astronauts made repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope in recent days. The shuttle had been scheduled to return to Earth first on Friday and then on Saturday. With bad weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA delayed the landing to Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori B. Garver, a former NASA official and adviser on space policy to President Obama during the campaign and the transition, was nominated as NASA's deputy administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed by the Senate, General Bolden would be the first black NASA administrator to serve on a permanent basis; Frederick D. Gregory, another black shuttle astronaut, served as acting administrator in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who stepped down in January, said in an e-mail message: ''General Bolden is not only a longtime friend and colleague, he is someone who has devoted most of his life to the service of his country. NASA will be in good hands.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden, 62, graduated from the United States Naval Academy and as a Marine aviator flew more than 100 combat missions in the Vietnam War. He became an astronaut in 1981 and traveled into orbit four times, including commanding a mission in 1986 that included Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, among the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nelson has since January pushed General Bolden for the NASA administrator position even as the administration initially considered other candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After leaving NASA in 1994, General Bolden returned to the Marines, rising to the rank of major general. He retired from the military in 2004. He briefly worked as a lobbyist for ATK, which manufactures the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle. More recently, he was on the board of <span class="companylink">Gencorp Inc</span>., whose <span class="companylink">Aerojet</span> subsidiary has a contract to build engines for the new planned astronaut capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of his space industry ties, the White House official said General Bolden would be issued a limited waiver to the administration's ethics policy that states appointees cannot take part in matters ''directly and substantially related'' to their former employers for two years. The waiver ''will permit him to participate in policy decisions that focus on major program objectives and capabilities,'' the official said, but General Bolden would not participate in contractual decisions involving ATK or Gencorp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden would take over NASA as disagreements about its future are erupting into wider view. NASA will retire its three remaining space shuttles by the end of 2010 and is developing a new generation of rockets that will not carry astronauts until at least 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's choice of a former astronaut and retired Marine general, Charles F. Bolden Jr., to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was warmly received by many space enthusiasts and lawmakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, General Bolden lacks deep expertise in space science and engineering and his past ties with the aerospace industry will raise conflict of interest problems. Before the Senate confirms him, it should probe how well fitted he is to guide the agency through a difficult transition from the space shuttle to follow-on vehicles designed to reach the Moon and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's choice for deputy administrator, Lori B. Garver, is a policy specialist who has served at NASA, in private space organizations, and as a consultant. She advised John Kerry in 2004 and Hillary Clinton in 2008 before switching to the winning Obama team and helping to lead its transition review for the space program. She has no technical background or major managerial experience but knows the agency and its issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden has some impressive credentials. As a Marine aviator, he flew more than 100 combat missions in the Vietnam War, and as an astronaut, he flew into orbit four times, twice as a shuttle commander. After the Challenger disaster in 1986, he was appointed to a critical safety job at Johnson Space Center to oversee efforts to resume safe shuttle flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has worked in a mid-level job at NASA headquarters and would be the first African-American to serve as administrator on a permanent basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he has an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and a master's in systems management, his skills are primarily operational. He lacks the deep technical expertise that enabled the previous administrator, Michael Griffin, to second-guess NASA's own experts and those from industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also concern that General Bolden may feel indebted to Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, one of his most outspoken backers, who tends to favor space activities that generate jobs and revenues in his home state. Moreover, his military background could blur the distinction between civil and military ventures in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration is already starting a review of the human space flight programs, so the appointees may mostly be implementers of decisions made at higher levels. Still, General Bolden's past ties to aerospace companies merit close examination. He consulted briefly for a company that makes engines for the first stage of a new space rocket under development. And he was a board member of a company that has a contract to build engines for a new astronaut capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he will apparently be told to steer clear of any contract discussions involving the two companies, the White House plans to grant him a ''limited waiver'' from its ethics rules to allow him to participate in decisions that affect major programs. Given that the new rockets and capsule are the heart of NASA's future plans, it would seem almost impossible for any broad decision not to affect them in some way. The Senate needs to assure itself that General Bolden will be fiercely independent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now there are six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew of the International Space Station doubled on Friday, with the arrival of the latest Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, the three crew members on board would immediately head home on the Soyuz. But now, with a full complement of solar panels, ample room and a working water-recycling system, the station is finally ready to be a full-time home for six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz, carrying Roman Romanenko of Russia, Frank De Winne of Belgium and Robert Thirsk of Canada, was launched Wednesday from Kazakhstan. It docked at 8:34 a.m. Eastern time Friday, and after checks for leaks, the hatches between the Soyuz and the station opened at 10:14 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current crew -- Gennady Padalka of Russia, the station commander, Michael Barratt of NASA and Koichi Wakata of JAXA, the Japanese space agency -- greeted the newcomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives from the five agencies taking part in the station project -- NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and JAXA -- radioed up congratulations. Partly by design, partly by circumstance, each agency is represented among the new expanded crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is wonderful to see all six of you up there, all five partners working together,'' said Steve MacLean, president of the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a crew of six, the amount of time spent on scientific experiments will grow to more than 70 hours a week from 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although fully staffed, the space station is not yet complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station will turn into a Grand Central of space when the space shuttleEndeavour arrives with seven astronauts on its next mission, currently scheduled for next month, for another burst of construction and renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During five spacewalks, astronauts are to complete the Japanese laboratory section, replace old batteries on one of the solar wings and unload spares for some important space station systems.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station crew doubled in size with the arrival of a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three people. The station, with a full complement of solar panels, ample room and a working water-recycling system, is ready to be a full-time home to six people after a decade of construction. The Soyuz was launched Wednesday from Kazakhstan. With a crew of six, the amount of time spent on scientific experiments will grow to more than 70 hours a week from 20.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first American woman in space, a co-founder of a small aerospace company and a retired United States Air Force general are among the members of an independent panel that will review the course of the nation's human space flight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration announced last month the creation of the panel that would take a ''fresh look'' at NASA's efforts to return to the moon by 2020. The panel will be led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin Corporation</span> who also led a major review of NASA in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, NASA announced the other nine members of the panel:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda M. Austin, president and chief executive of the Aerospace Corporation, which provides engineering analysis on the space program for the government. The Aerospace Corporation recently conducted a study looking at whether the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets used to launch military satellites could be adapted to carry NASA astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bohdan Bejmuk, chairman of a review board overseeing NASA's development of next-generation rockets, known as the Constellation program. Mr. Bejmuk previously managed <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s involvement in Sea Launch, an ocean platform for launching rockets, and the space shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut who spent six and a half months in orbit as commander of the International Space Station in 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher F. Chyba, a professor of astrophysical sciences and international affairs at Princeton University and a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Dr. Chyba's space-related research focuses on the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward F. Crawley, a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was co-chairman of a committee that reviewed NASA's progress in developing technologies needed for future human space flight missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Greason, co-founder and chief executive of <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>. XCOR is developing a two-seat suborbital space plane intended to take tourists for brief visits to the edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Kennel, chairman of the National Academies Space Studies Board and former director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lester L. Lyles, a retired Air Force general who reportedly was one of the people being considered for NASA administrator before President Obama selected Charles F. Bolden, a former astronaut and Marine Corps general. General Lyles is chairman of a National Academies-sponsored committee that will also provide advice on United States space policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sally Ride, a former astronaut who was first American woman in space when she flew aboard the space shuttle in 1983.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel's first meeting is scheduled for June 17 in Washington, and it will make its recommendations by the end of August.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before NASA sends astronauts back to the Moon, it wants to scope out the territory it has largely ignored since the last time it sent astronauts there nearly 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter -- scheduled to launch Thursday, although its liftoff may be bumped back a day by the space shuttleEndeavour -- will carry out the first in a series of robotic missions to map and measure the Moon in far greater detail than before. Of particular interest is whether frozen water might lurk in the shadows of craters near the Moon's poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those areas of the Moon, we actually have very sparse information of,'' said Craig Tooley, the project manager of the mission. ''We have much better maps of Mars than we have of our Moon's polar regions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the occupants of a future lunar settlement, ice would be a source not only of drinking water, but also air and energy. Water molecules can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter's payload includes a camera that can make out objects as small as a yard wide, a heat-mapping instrument to find where it might be cold enough for ice to persist near the surface, a laser altimeter for generating topographic maps, and a cosmic ray telescope for measuring the radiation raining down on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission's primary purpose is to help NASA locate landing places for the astronauts and plan how to build a Moon base. The data will also be a boon to scientists. The ice, if it exists, could provide a unique record of the past two billion years of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portions of the polar craters lie in permanent shadow with temperatures below minus-300 degrees Fahrenheit. Planetary scientists hypothesize that when comets struck the Moon, water vapor from the impacts could have collected on the cold spots in the craters. If true, ''the Moon becomes a repository for ancient records of impacts,'' said James B. Garvin, NASA's chief scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1990s, the Clementine spacecraft, a collaboration between NASA and the Defense Department, found bright radar reflections that suggested something shiny at the bottom of craters near the south pole. In 1998, NASA's Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected the presence of hydrogen, and perhaps the simplest explanation is that the hydrogen is within water molecules, although the hydrogen could also come from solar wind particles slammed into the lunar soil over billions of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instruments aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter are much more sensitive and precise and may provide a definitive answer. If that is not sufficient, a second space probe hitching a ride into space with the orbiter could provide even more direct evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Atlas V rocket carrying the orbiter is capable of lifting a heavier payload, NASA used the extra space and weight for a second mission known as the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After liftoff, the orbiter and LCROSS will detach. LCROSS will hang on to the rocket's depleted second stage and swing past the Moon onto a polar orbit around the Earth. In October, that orbit will intersect with the Moon's path. LCROSS will jettison the upper stage toward one of the polar craters and photograph the impact. If the plume of debris contains water ice, LCROSS should be able to detect it. It will then quickly send the data back to Earth before it too slams into the Moon four minutes later.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>789 words</div><div>18 June 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>26</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- NASA's goal is to return to space after the retirement of the shuttles next year, but a panel reviewing the agency's human spaceflight program heard very different ideas Wednesday on how to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In dueling PowerPoint presentations before the 10-member panel, appointed by the Obama administration in April, NASA officials defended their progress in developing the next generation of rockets, while challengers said that they could do the job more quickly and less expensively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the Ares I, the first rocket being developed in the agency's Constellation program, was on course for launching astronauts to the International Space Station in March 2015, despite technical hurdles and lower-than-expected budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Steve Cook, manager of the Ares Project at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said that the cost estimate for developing the Ares I and seeing it through its first manned flight was $35 billion. Contrary to the claims of critics, he said, costs have not spiraled out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a stable plan to get us to 2015,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Michael C. Gass, president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of the <span class="companylink">Boeing Company</span> and Lockheed Martin, asked the panel to consider ''potential credible alternatives'' to Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Delta IV Heavy rocket, which carries satellites into orbit for the military and other customers, could be upgraded for astronauts and perform the tasks of Ares I. The Delta IV would be safer and cheaper and could be ready in 2014, Mr. Gass said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA-commissioned study by the Aerospace Corporation concluded that the Delta IV could replace the Ares I, possibly at lower cost, but raised questions of how to move beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aerospace study also concluded that upgrading the Delta IV to carry astronauts would take five and a half to seven years, although on Wednesday several members of the panel appeared skeptical that it would take that long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In NASA's plan, the Ares I would use solid rocket motors and a second-stage engine that would be reused in the design of the Ares V, a much larger rocket to carry the heavy cargo needed to get to the Moon or Mars. Mr. Gass, however, said that more powerful versions of Delta and Atlas rockets could be developed to serve the role envisioned for the Ares V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of another alternative to the Ares rockets, known as Direct and devised by unidentified engineers ostensibly within NASA, also presented their idea to the panel: to shift components of the space shuttle into a new series of rockets. They, too, asserted that their option would be cheaper and faster than the NASA plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review panel, led by Norman R. Augustine, former chief executive of Lockheed Martin, was appointed by the Obama administration to re-evaluate NASA's human spaceflight program and make recommendations by the end of August. The daylong meeting on Wednesday, at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, was the first of four planned public sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who is a leading lawmaker on NASA issues, told the panel that its recommendations would probably shape the United States' space program for years to come and that supporters of any competing vision would be hard pressed to gain support in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You come to the table with extraordinary influence,'' Mr. Nelson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the panel held its meeting to explore NASA's future, the agency's present remained firmly on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Endeavour had been scheduled to lift off at 5:40 a.m. Wednesday on a 16-day mission to the space station, but a leak in a vent line that relieves hydrogen gas pressure in the external tank scuttled the launching. A similar leak foiled the first launching attempt, on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High levels of hydrogen near the tank pose a danger of fire or explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to step back and figure out what the problem is and go fix it,'' said LeRoy E. Cain, the deputy shuttle program manager, in a news conference after the launching was canceled. ''And then we'll fly as soon as we're ready to safely resume.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next chance to launch is July 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have the sense this is something we'll fix pretty quick,'' said John Shannon, the shuttle program manager, who was in Washington for the hearing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty summers ago, the world was transfixed by the sight of you walking on the moon. Have we made any progress since the Apollo 11 flight?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not a whole lot. We shifted our attention to low-earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meaning the shuttle program, which is about to end?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've been concentrating on the shuttle, the space station and laying the groundwork for returning to the moon. The disturbing part is that, all this time, Russia has been concentrating on Phobos, a moon of Mars, and a number of us have recently realized just how significant that would be as a stepping stone to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think Mars has more to offer than the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, much more. It's much more terrestrial. It has a thin atmosphere and a day/night cycle that is very similar to ours. It has seasons. Russia perhaps is still entertaining the possibility that the moons of Mars might have access to ice or water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you saying the moon has become passe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not promising for commercial activities. It's got science, it may have strategic values but I don't believe it's a requirement for Americans to be present to take advantage of the resources. Their viability can be determined by robots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are the days of American pre-eminence in space over?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it true that Buzz Lightyear, the cartoon astronaut, was named after you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently, but there's no evidence in my bank account to substantiate that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you know Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who has been nominated by President Obama to head NASA?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know him quite well. I was a little puzzled when I realized that his major champion is Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who flew with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right, Nelson was a congressman when he flew on the shuttle. But isn't that a good thing, making it easier for Bolden to muster Congressional support for NASA? Why were you puzzled?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm in favor of changing the destination of humans. There are a lot of manned missions that can be done, but not in the direction of the moon. I am not sure about Bill Nelson. I haven't heard him say, ''Let's junk the NASA plan to send humans to the moon.'' He's not about to say that. That would not be very popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You were the second person to walk on the moon, after Neil Armstrong. Was it annoying to go second?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. At that time I wasn't looking for more laurels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You gave yourself communion on the surface of the moon. Are you still a churchgoer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. My Sunday mornings are spent in a recovery meeting in Pacific Palisades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In your new memoir, ''Magnificent Desolation,'' which comes out this week, you recount a period of ruinous drinking and clinical depression following your time in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I inherited depression from my mother's side of the family. Her father committed suicide. She committed suicide the year before I went to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was your mother's maiden name really Marion Moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes. I didn't feel NASA needed to know that. Somebody would think I was trying to get favored treatment because my ancestors had the name Moon. And that's a joke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you find it odd that we're observing the 40th anniversary of both the moonwalk and Woodstock?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think I'm going to journey to Woodstock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sort of music do you like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I just did a rap session with Snoop Dogg and a rap composition called ''Rocket Experience.'' It's going to be an online video. The Web site is funnyordie.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you actually sing on the video?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I relate. It's not singing, it's rapping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How old are you now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 20, the anniversary of landing on the moon, I will be precisely 79 and a half. It's nice to be on this side of troubled waters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9 P.M. (Science) BUILD IT BIGGER Houston, he's good to go! In this special ''Space Week'' episode, Danny Forster ventures behind the scenes of Mission Control and Cape Canaveral as he examines the Constellation Program, NASA's latest bold foray into the final frontier. The mission: to return to the moon, establish a permanent lunar base and then hop a spacecraft next door to Mars. Mr. Forster looks at the prototype for the new lunar rover; engineering strategies for launching rockets faster and more safely; underwater astronaut training; and preparations for the space shuttle Endeavor's final flights before it is retired after 30 years and more than 100 successful missions. And in what he called ''the coolest boyhood dream to come true thus far in my career,'' Mr. Forster, above right, with the Endeavor, gets to try his hand at piloting the space shuttle inside the official flight simulator.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paving the way for a July 11 launching, NASA successfully filled the fuel tank of the space shuttleEndeavour without recurrence of a hydrogen leak. Such leaks, which occurred in a vent line that relieves pressure of hydrogen gas from the tank, scuttled two attempted launchings last month. NASA engineers found the problem was caused by a misalignment in the connection between the tank and the vent line and replaced the seals with a different design that they believed would hold more tightly. In the test, the level of hydrogen gas was only 12 parts per million compared with more than 60,000 parts per million during the attempted launchings. The launching attempt will be at 7:39 p.m. on July 11.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars are the meat and potatoes of astronomy and cosmology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything we know about the universe depends on a remarkably intimate and hard-won knowledge of how they shine, age and die. They have defined the night for generations, and provided our ancestors with the first hints of a regularity in nature that has haunted scientists and thinkers for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet stars rarely occupy the main ring in popular expositions of the cosmos these days. Black holes, the infinitely dense corpses of some stars, drowning all light and matter, are more dramatic. Planets, especially those around distant stars, are more alluring to the imagination. Cosmologists seem to spend more time worrying about the origins of galaxies, the galumphing clouds in which stars live. Now, however, to rebalance the cosmos, so to speak, comes ''Journey to the Stars,'' a new show in the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History. Narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, it is dedicated to elucidating the nature of those pinpricks in the heavenly vault and what they mean to us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Journey'' is easily the most beautiful planetarium show I have ever seen and the most vertiginous. The filmmakers have an entire 3-D universe in their supercomputer, and they aren't afraid to use it to swoop us outward through the stars falling past us faster and faster like snowflakes past the windshield in a storm, flipping us over and diving back and forth through the Milky Way past gnarled ribbons of nebulae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half an hour after the show ended, my head was still spinning, and it wasn't from the Secrets of the Cosmos cosmopolitans with dry-ice cubes the museum was serving to its supporters on the terrace that night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What those pinpricks mean to us, of course, is everything -- from the big blob in the sky, known as the Sun, that warms our planet and makes life possible, to the explosions that end some stars' lives and seed the galaxy with the elements necessary for life. With the exception of hydrogen and some helium and lithium, all the atoms in the universe (and thus in our bodies) have been manufactured by stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Goldberg wisely refrains from repeating the old Joni Mitchell chestnut (literally true as it may be) ''We are stardust,'' but she does say emphatically, ''The journey to the stars is truly a journey to the heart of what we are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This show, three years in the making, was written by Louise A. Gikow, a former writer for ''Sesame Street,'' among many other things, as well as a co-writer of the Hayden's previous space production, ''Cosmic Collisions.'' It was directed by the planetarium's director of astrovisualization, Carter Emmart, who studied geophysics before going into star shows. Robert Miller, a veteran composer for films and commercials, wrote the score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Journey'' was overseen by Mordecai-Mark Mac Low and Ben Oppenheimer, both astronomers at the museum, who say their goal was to get people to look at the stars in a new way. To that end they had a lot of resources to draw on, including the California Academy of Sciences; the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas, Austin; and NASA's heliophysics division, which maintains a fleet of spacecraft watching the Sun and nearby space for nasty space weather that could affect the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So forget the erudite tours of a placid sky and constellations virtually unchanged since humans started gazing upward in that wonder. Speeding up the cosmic clock with the help of all that computer power, the show shows us a sky as changeable and dynamic as any Broadway musical or summer blockbuster, with stars booming, blazing, swirling, dying and sprouting again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The filmmakers are not afraid to get in our faces. Showing us the Sun's corona, the feathery hot gases that extend invisibly except during total solar eclipses far out into space, they pull the Sun down over our heads until it takes up half the planetarium dome squatting over us like a spider with rays fanning out around it, sort of like Doctor Octopus in ''Spider-Man 2.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later on, a red giant star, boiling with planet-roasting energy, leers down at us like an angry red eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium masters like to rock the seats a lot too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tour begins at the beginning, some 300 million years after the Big Bang, when, astronomers think, the very first star condensed out of murky clouds of hydrogen and helium, lit up the darkness and promptly went boom. The chairs shake. A few seconds later the whole dome is illuminated with more stars flaring up and exploding, spraying clouds and colors across the sky. These first stars were monsters, 100 times as massive as the Sun, cosmologists concluded. As a result, Ms. Goldberg says, ''They burned hot, they lived fast, and they died young.'' Boom. Shake. Boom. Shake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their deaths from supernova explosions sprayed new elements -- gold, oxygen, iron, carbon and so forth -- across space. Each of our bodies contains a teaspoonful of elements from those first stars 13 billion years ago, Ms. Goldberg reports in what was a genuine ''gee-whiz'' moment for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starmaking reached a crescendo about 10 billion years ago, about the same time the Milky Way galaxy was formed, we are told. The Sun came along still later, about 4.6 billion years ago when a cloud of gas and dust, perhaps jarred by a nearby supernova explosion collapsed. Stripping away the layers of the Sun, we come finally to the center and a blizzard of dots flashing around not unlike the earlier scenes of flying past stars in space. But now the dots are atoms, atomic nuclei fusing to unleash the energy that makes the Sun shine and the corn grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backing out of the Sun past a spotted stormy face blasting particles into space at a million miles an hour, we see threads of magnetism snaking and weaving far out into space tickling the planets like Earth and Saturn with auroras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will all end eventually. In a few billion years the Sun will swell to a so-called red giant, roasting the Earth before collapsing and puffing its outer layers into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is already beginning all over again. A tour of nearby space reveals myriad new stars, enriched by previous stellar generations, hatching out of little teardrop cocoons of dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end we're back in New York, and Ms. Goldberg asks us to pick a star on the dome and imagine it: What color is it? Does it have planets? Is it young or old?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So before the Sun comes up,'' she continues, ''since you've already picked a star, why not make a wish?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I did. Naturally, I can't tell you what it was. You'll have to go choose your own star and make your own wish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Journey to the Stars'' begins on Saturday at the Hayden Planetarium, in the Rose Center for Earth and Space, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 81st Street. It will be shown every 30 minutes daily from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., except Wednesdays, when the first show is at 11 a.m. Tickets, which include museum, Rose Center and planetarium admission, are $24; students and 60+, $18; 2 to 12, $14; (212) 769-5200; amnh.org.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes, dead stars and other objects so dense that not even light can escape them might seem like the most inwardly focused denizens of the universe. Space and time have effectively closed around them, leaving no exit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But astronomers have found growing evidence that black holes can be extroverts, reaching out across millions of light-years and controlling the destinies of galaxies and even clusters of galaxies. The ultimate control freaks, the black holes seem to be able to regulate other objects' cosmic growth by a fiery feedback of light and other radiation from material on its way to oblivion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now, researchers have found evidence that black holes may also be the key to mysterious glowing clouds of gas lurking in the early universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 10 years, astronomers patrolling the distant reaches of space have discovered dozens of these clouds, which are technically called blobs. One, named Himiko after a mythical Japanese queen by the Japanese astronomers who found it, dates to only 840 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blobs inhabit places and times in which galaxies and stars were being built like gangbusters, but astronomers have been divided about what these blobs have to say about how galaxies are born, and what makes them glow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of astronomers, brandishing results from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, are now pointing a finger at black holes. The blobs, they reported at a recent news conference and in a paper to be published on Friday in The Astrophysical Journal, are being blasted and lighted up from inside by the radiation spilling from the lips of supermassive black holes, weighing in at perhaps a billion times the mass of the Sun, at the centers of newly forming galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blobs themselves were probably ''leftovers,'' as one scientist put it, from the initial growth spurts of these galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The blobs,'' said James Geach of Durham University in England, might be ''the signatures of galaxies coming of age.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mario Livio, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore who was not involved in the research, said ''it is a bit like understanding the teenage years in the life of humans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Training the Chandra satellite on a field of 29 blobs in the constellation of Aquarius that lived about two billion years after the Big Bang, Dr. Geach and his colleagues from Durham found the telltale signature of X-rays from a supermassive black hole in five of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Geach and his colleagues said that the X-rays from other blobs might have just been too weak to be seen by Chandra, which was operating at its observational limits during a five-day exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galaxies grow, and grow and grow, so the accepted story goes, from small lumps left in the primordial gravy after the Big Bang that attract gas and the so-called dark matter permeating space. At some point -- and theorists still debate this -- a black hole forms in the middle of this growing lump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, black holes are thought to live in the centers of most galaxies, gulping the occasional unlucky star or gas cloud that falls too close, spilling X-rays and other fireworks in a fit of sloppy digestion. The more the galaxy grows, the more its central black hole feeds and spits fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point radiation from the black hole and new stars forming in waves in the galaxy will be so strong that it will push back on the falling material. The galaxy will stop growing. That is what Dr. Geach and his colleagues claim to have seen. The infant galaxies Chandra observed, the astronomers said, are today probably among the most massive in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The blobs look to be leftovers from the formation of giant galaxies,'' said Bret Lehmer, also of Durham. Too hot to fall any farther into the new galaxy, they are destined to wind up as intergalactic gas, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time that black holes have been seen to reach back out and influence the cosmos around them. In 2003, astronomers also using the Chandra observatory discovered that a supermassive black hole in the constellation Perseus was blowing bubbles 30,000 light-years in diameter across the Perseus cluster of galaxies, with periodic outbursts every 10 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect in the case of Perseus is to keep intergalactic gas in the cluster too hot to fall into the center of the cluster and condense into stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Rees, a cosmologist at the University of Cambridge, in England, said there seemed to be a spooky correlation between the masses of black holes and the galaxies in which they are embedded, leading astronomers to suspect some feedback mechanism. Speaking of the new Chandra results, Dr. Rees said, ''I think in these observations we are seeing when that is actually happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that conclusion was not unanimous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, at the same time that Dr. Geach and his colleagues first posted their results on the Internet, Abraham Loeb and Mark Dijkstra of Harvard submitted their own paper to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, with a different explanation of the blobs. They pointed out that cold gas streaming into a massive protogalaxy would heat up from the gravitational energy gained by falling in and would glow of its own accord as a way of cooling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about Dr. Geach's results by e-mail, Dr. Loeb said that it was too soon to conclude that all the blobs were powered by black holes, noting that ''the hard evidence is only 17 percent of all blobs, and the rest is speculations.'' The inflow of cold gas necessary to build up a black hole and all those stars, he said, would glow even in the absence of any black-hole fireworks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Livio said Dr. Geach had made a strong case that black holes can heat blobs. There could be different answers for other objects, he said by e-mail, ''but physics rarely works this way.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has another short window Saturday to get the space shuttleEndeavour off the ground and resume construction of the International Space Station. Two launching efforts last month were scuttled by a hydrogen gas leak in a vent line next to the external fuel tank. Engineers appear to have solved that problem by installing seals of a different design. No significant leaks were detected in testing last week. The countdown started with no technical issues, but now thunderstorms in the area may force postponement of the launching, scheduled for 7:39 p.m. Forecasts improve on Sunday and Monday. If the shuttle is not launched by Tuesday, the launching will be pushed back to July 27 to allow an unmanned Russian supply ship to head to the space station.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early space race was really a chase, with the United States trailing its superpower rival -- the So-viet Union -- badly. The Soviets took a strong lead by tossing Sputnik 1 into Earth orbit in 1957 and smacking the moon in the face with the Luna 2 probe in 1959. Although the United States launched its first Earth satellite in 1958, its less powerful rockets had a tendency to detonate on the launch pad like short-fused bombs or break up after takeoff and sizzle like Fourth of July fireworks, or veer off course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T-Minus: The Race to the Moon,'' a graphic novel written by Jim Ottaviani, tells the story of America's come-from-behind victory in the space race's main event -- a manned moon landing. Ottaviani takes minimal liberties with the actual events to compress the great race into 124 pages: he deftly reimagines and expands the roles played by a few real-life aerospace engineers and contractors and imagines plausible dialogue for places where the historical record is incomplete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The illustrations by Kevin Cannon and Zander Cannon (no relation) capture both the inky vastness of space and the glory of the big flying machines, but the book's primary subject is human emotions, not rockets or the heavens. Again and again, ''T-Minus'' -- rocketeer lingo for time until takeoff -- relies on close-ups to dramatize the life work of rocket visionaries from both nations' space programs, like Robert Goddard, Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev. It's about time the people who designed and built the spacecraft got top billing over the flyboys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soviet Union's first firsts were followed by still more: first to put a live animal into orbit (Laika the space dog in 1958); first to put a man into orbit (1961); first to put a woman into orbit (1963); first to conduct a space walk (1965). By the mid-1960s the Soviets owned all of the space endurance flight records, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between the two programs seemed to widen in 1967 after Gus Grissom and his two crew mates died in a fire during a launch-pad practice session of their Apollo 1 capsule. NASA, which ran the space program, suspended Apollo flights while it made the craft safer, and President John F. Kennedy's goal of landing on the moon by the end of the 1960s appeared unreachable. But then the Soviets stumbled. Korolev, a top rocket designer, died unexpectedly during surgery in 1966, and the Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed during the emergency landing of the Soyuz 1. These events helped to sidetrack the Soviet program and create an opening for the Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of successful Apollo missions in the late 1960s restored confidence at NASA and provided the steppingstones for an American moon landing. Just before Christmas 1968, in a preview of what was to come, the re-engineered Apollo 8 left Earth's gravity and orbited the moon. ''T-Minus'' treats this flight to as many pages as the moon landing mission itself. In March 1969, Apollo 9 practiced docking with the lunar landing vehicle in Earth orbit; two months later Apollo 10 did the same in moon orbit; and on July 20, 1969 -- 40 years ago -- Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon at Tranquillity Base while Michael Collins orbited above in the mother ship that would ferry them back home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T-Minus'' captures the optimism and courage of both countries' space pioneers, making it an ideal entry point for new readers intrigued by the topic. Space know-it-alls will learn something, too. Who knew that the Apollo's Saturn V launcher was delivered from Huntsville, Ala., to its Florida launch pad by barge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a well-researched book. In its constellation of useful facts, dates and figures, I found just one error: it wrongly states that John Glenn's Friendship 7 orbited the Earth in 1961. As the authors know, Glenn's flight came in 1962.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slickly produced ''One Small Step: Celebrating the First Men on the Moon'' purports to be a space-race scrapbook assembled by a young boy named Mike, who is pictured on its opening page and whose mother is a NASA scientist. Any reader inquisitive enough to enjoy ''One Small Step'' will quickly figure out that the annotated photos, insignias, lists, engineering diagrams and artwork taped and paper-clipped into place were assembled by the professionals listed on the book's copyright page, none of them named Mike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Awkward as this approach is, don't let it keep you from appreciating ''One Small Step.'' The book's scrapbook format invites readers to explore the concepts, technologies and personal stories behind manned space flight. Flaps open to chart the space race's timeline or to explain the functioning of a piece of space hardware. A postcard with Laika the space dog begs to be peeled off the page and mailed. There's even a detachable ''First Man on the Moon'' mini-pennant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mission to the Moon,'' by Alan Dyer, celebrating the Apollo 11 anniversary, covers much of the same area but does so with a straight documentary approach supplemented by a bonus DVD of Apollo footage (which works on a computer disk drive but not on a TV). If ''One Small Step'' is big fun, ''Mission to the Moon'' is serious fun, trusting the material instead of flaps and human drama to sustain reader interest. It should go without saying which book I'd pick to spend an evening with and which book I'd choose to add to my library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These three books remind us of the time when the moon was a place people actually visited, a time of science fact that eclipses every volume of science fiction ever written. As any 12-year-old can tell you, the long-ago years of the space race still feel more like the future than anything on the horizon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching of the space shuttleEndeavour was postponed on Saturday for at least a day so engineers could make sure that the spacecraft's electrical systems had not been damaged by lightning strikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fierce thunderstorm passed through the Cape Canaveral area on Friday afternoon, and there were reports of at least 11 lightning strikes near the launching pad. NASA officials said there had been no direct strikes to the Endeavour, but they wanted an extra day to inspect the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new launching time is 7:14 p.m. Sunday. The Endeavour is set to spend 16 days in space to continue construction of the International Space Station.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Craig Nelson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 404 pp. Viking. $27.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VOICES FROM THE MOON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo Astronauts Describe Their Lunar Experiences</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Andrew Chaikin with Victoria Kohl</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 201 pp. Viking Studio. $29.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the moon landings is an oft-told tale, but one that feels stranger with each new telling. Walter Cronkite's prediction, that after Apollo 11 ''everything else that has happened in our time is going to be an asterisk,'' wound up playing out backward. In our pop-historical memory of the 1960s, Project Apollo is the footnote, an oddball offshoot from assassinations, Vietnam and Charles Manson. Since 1972, no human has traveled beyond low-Earth orbit, a situation that makes one imagine what things might be like if, after Lindbergh's flight, the species had contentedly gone back to making do with boats and trains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Nelson's ''Rocket Men'' lacks the shapeliness and authority of some earlier lunar histories, but it ends up making an engaging contribution. He sensibly sets the Apollo period against ''the interminable shuttle/space station era'' that followed, and before that tracks the space race against the missile race that proceeded alongside it. Soviet-American competition in space may have looked like a peaceful alternative to war -- a ''celestial olympics'' in Nelson's nice phrasing -- but the civilian-controlled NASA retained its ''military DNA.'' Lyndon Johnson, who earmarked the most money for the agency, confidentially pronounced it a bargain because of the yield from spy photography made possible in part by Project Gemini: ''We know how many missiles the enemy has and, it turned out, our guesses were way off. We were building things we didn't need to build.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnson's predecessor had reached the White House by denouncing a missile gap that didn't really exist. Once he was there, John F. Kennedy embraced the goal of a moon landing after the one-two punch of Yuri Gagarin's orbital flight and the Bay of Pigs debacle, but not from any personal enthusiasm for exploration. (''I'm not that interested in space,'' he told NASA officials in 1962.) Addressing the United Nations after the successful completion of Project Mercury and only two months before his death, the president expressed his willingness to see the United States go to the moon with the Soviets instead of alone. Whether, during a second term, he might have ended the space race is a matter debated among historians of NASA just as the president's ultimate intentions about Vietnam excite those in other fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the event, the speed with which the Apollo program was realized is unimaginable to anyone young enough only to have seen the manned space program shuttle only through its later elephantine circles. Kennedy's ''before this decade is out'' deadline for a lunar landing wasn't pushed back, even after the Apollo 1 ground fire of 1967, which killed three astronauts and created an 18-month gap between manned missions. During that period, Nelson writes, ''the entire agency would be re-engineered.'' The tightly wound Frank Borman, commander of Apollo 8, recalls the atmosphere after the fire: ''People got to drinking too much, taking uppers and downers, and the damn doctors were handing out stuff so that people could go to sleep and so they could wake up.'' No space history -- not Nelson's, not even Charles Murray and Catherine Bly Cox's 1989 volume, ''Apollo,'' which was oriented toward operations on the ground -- has yet done this time and milieu full justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson does make good use of NASA oral histories to amplify and adjust what one remembers of the early Apollo missions. However heavenly the voyage of Apollo 8 may have seemed -- on Christmas Eve 1968, the astronauts read aloud from Genesis during their ninth orbit of the moon -- Bill Anders, who flew the mission with Borman and Jim Lovell, reminds us that the cramped and vomit-stained command module felt like ''an outhouse'' by the time it splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. The success of quiet, opaque Neil Armstrong has come to seem inevitable, but he was hardly a good-luck charm: before Apollo 11, he was nearly killed flying Gemini 8 and testing the lunar lander, and he had seen his own house in Houston burn to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin overshot their planned landing point and nearly ran out of fuel as they dodged boulders and false alarms from their computerized dashboard, looking for a place to come down. They made it with 17 seconds to spare. That night the Soviets' unmanned Luna 15 spacecraft, which they hoped would scoop up rock samples and beat Apollo 11 home, crash-landed into another part of the moon, while the two Americans, having completed their walk around Tranquility Base, slept in the lunar module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson's account of Apollo 11 fills about a quarter of the odd, modular structure he chooses for his book. He never goes for long without executing some nice writerly flourish -- astronauts carrying their briefcase-shaped ventilators to the launch pad resemble ''businessmen on their way to the future'' -- but a reader's ears are sometimes irritated by the sound of boilerplate clanging into place (''greatest tragedies . . . astonishing triumphs''). Among Nelson's achievements is the restoration of a certain grandeur to the moon itself, whose near-planetary status is arguable from the fact that ''of 150 moons in the solar system, ours is the largest in relation to its host.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their ''general lack of verbal firepower,'' the moon's astronaut explorers did their best to convey the look of the dusty world they suddenly saw in such sharp relief. (''Be descriptive!'' Jan Armstrong called out to her husband's televised form.) Some of their strongest efforts at recalling the lunar landscape can be found in ''Voices From the Moon,'' a new book of mission photographs and astronaut quotations compiled by Andrew Chaikin (author of ''A Man on the Moon'') and Victoria Kohl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few of the recollections may stop you cold. Apollo 12's Alan Bean, who later became a painter, recalls looking with wonder at Earth before having to upbraid himself: ''I would say, I've got to quit doing this . . . because when I'm doing this, I'm not looking for rocks.'' If any real scandal attaches to Project Apollo, it's the extent to which hard science was allowed to dominate the astronauts' hours on the moon. With less geology and more ontology, they might have kept the public fired up for further space exploration. Even Frank Borman, who became a no-nonsense C.E.O. back on Earth, realizes what the missions should really have been about: ''We took the human intellect and the human vision, the human mind, 240,000 miles away from its home base. . . . Whether we found a rock there or not was of no importance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson properly shakes his head over the long epilogue: ''A mere 25 years from guided missile to man on the moon, and then . . . nothing.'' Spectacular unmanned probes on the order of Galileo and Cassini, yes; but where manned spaceflight is concerned, NASA currently continues on the same irresolute and unimaginative road it has traveled since Richard Nixon's last years in the White House. The Eagle, Armstrong and Aldrin's delicate landing craft, returned the two astronauts to Apollo 11's command module on July 21, 1969. The springy little machine, having done its job, was then cut loose. It fell back into lunar orbit and eventually to the moon's surface. To this day, no one knows exactly where it is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The space shuttleEndeavour was ready on Sunday, but the weather was not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle was to take off at 7:14 p.m. But, as the launching time approached, lightning and showers encroached within 20 miles of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, too close if the shuttle needed to make an emergency landing. NASA will try again at 6:51 p.m. Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, two launching attempts were called off because of a hydrogen leak. Then lightning struck the launching pad Friday, postponing a Saturday attempt. On Sunday, no technical problems arose, but the clouds moved in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interest in space exploration wasn't anything new in my life. My mother was a space enthusiast and I grew up interested in the conquest of space. So I was tracking all that stuff for years. In 1966, I went on a campaign to get high-quality photographs of the Earth taken from space. Despite the space race, there had still been no strong photographs of the Earth from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Apollo 8 went up on Dec. 29, 1968 -- the same year we first published the ''Whole Earth Catalog'' -- they finally took the first Earthrise photograph, the famous one that everyone now knows. And that helped spawn the environmental movement. That became the planetary icon. It replaced the mushroom cloud as the dominant image of the age, replacing an image of fear with an image of hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1960s didn't die quietly. In the final summer of a world-shaking decade, there were antiwar demonstrations, a new women's rights movement on the streets, the Stonewall riot and a giant mud bath with music -- the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. But on July 20, 1969, the clamor stilled as people across the country and around the world gathered to see two astronauts walk on the Moon. For all the divisions of the era, this was a moment of unity and pride, and sometimes even lifechanging inspiration. Here are 14 recollections of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA had a total of 11 flights in its Apollo program, only 6 actually landed on the Moon. Along with Neil A. Armstrong, who took the first step on the surface, 11 other men left the relative safety of their lunar landers to collect rock and dust samples and complete the goals of each mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On each trip, one of the three astronauts remained in the command module and orbited the Moon until the others returned. After the Apollo program ended, the astronauts went on to varied endeavors. Profiles of all 18 are at nytimes.com/space; below, an update on the astronauts who traveled to the Moon on Apollo 11, in July 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil A. Armstrong</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's program to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2020 is often called ''Apollo on steroids.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To detractors, this is a description of disparagement -- treading the same path as 40 years ago, only with bigger, costlier rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say the new missions will be much grander -- astronauts living on the Moon for months at a time, driving hundreds of miles across the lunar surface and, for the first time, building an outpost on ground that is not Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just flags and footsteps,'' said John Olson, director of the office within NASA's exploration systems mission directorate that integrates the disparate parts of a lunar program. ''It's substantially important work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technologies and skills, the NASA officials say, are essential before pushing on to Mars, the next major destination. Scientists see several exciting research possibilities on the Moon, like building a radio telescope on the far side, shielded from the noise from Earth, and looking for layers of frost in shadowed craters near the poles, which may preserve hints of the solar system's past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with trillion-dollar federal budget deficits and a blue ribbon panel now re-evaluating the United States' human space flight program, there is some question whether the lunar designs that NASA has drawn up over the past five years will be built. The agency could be told to focus on robotic missions, to undertake cheaper alternatives for getting to the Moon or to shift its target to something else, like an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If NASA does not go to the Moon, it is not clear anyone else would go, either. Some Chinese and Russian officials have talked about establishing a Moon base sometime around 2025, but neither China nor Russia has made any official pronouncements, and their current rockets are too small for the task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nascent private space industry, which has yet to send anyone into orbit, does not seem likely to head to the Moon, either, with no obvious profit windfall to offset the billions of dollars in cost. ''The idea that a private investor can put together the funds to develop rockets capable of a lunar mission is extremely speculative, verging on fantasy,'' said John Logsdon, chairman of space history at the National Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is perhaps more likely is that the Moon program will, like the International Space Station, become a combined effort of multiple nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the first public meeting of the panel reviewing NASA's human spaceflight program, Gen. Anatoly N. Perminov, the head of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said by telephone, ''Roscosmos supports the necessity of involving technical and scientific potential of other countries for such large-scale projects,'' including sending astronauts to the Moon and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has named its next-generation space transportation system the Constellation program. The first two pieces of Constellation -- the Ares I rocket with an Orion crew capsule -- are to take astronauts to the International Space Station beginning in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two additional pieces are needed for the trip to the Moon: the Ares V, a behemoth ''heavy lifter'' rocket, and the Altair lunar lander, for getting the astronauts down to the Moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, the Ares V looks more or less like the Saturn V from the Apollo era, and the Altair looks like a fashion update -- with a rounder, more modern aesthetic -- of the lander that carried Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the Sea of Tranquillity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Physics and engineering drive a lot of the designs,'' Dr. Olson said, explaining the similarities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the differences. The Ares V is to be just a tad taller than the Saturn V -- 381 feet versus 363 feet. But the Ares V will be able to send about 140,000 pounds on a journey to the Moon, or 40 percent more than the Saturn V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares V, unlike the Saturn V, will not carry astronauts as it lifts off. Following the recommendations of panel that investigated the loss of the space shuttle Columbia, the Constellation program puts crew and cargo on separate rockets to improve astronaut safety. While most of the spacecraft hardware -- the Altair lander and the Earth departure stage -- goes up on the Ares V, a crew of four astronauts will launch in an Orion capsule on top of an Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Earth orbit, the Orion capsule will dock with the components sent up by the Ares V, and the combined spacecraft will then head to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Apollo 11, Michael Collins had to sit by himself circling the Moon in the command module while his two companions went to the surface in the lander. For the next Moon missions, all four astronauts are to head to the surface, while the Orion capsule, empty, takes care of itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the Altair lander must be much larger than the Apollo-era lander, both to carry the additional astronauts and supplies and to be able to reach more parts of the Moon. The advances in technology could also enable cargo versions of the Altair -- without astronauts -- to bring modular components of an outpost as well as R.V.-size rovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover concept calls for a fully pressurized cabin in which the astronauts can work in short sleeves. For sorties lasting a week or so, the astronauts would be essentially living out of their car. ''Call it a 'Luna-bago' of sorts!'' Dr. Olson said.The spacesuits would actually be stored outside the rover, and the astronauts would be able to jump into them via openings in the back, enabling them to go from inside to outside in 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a total game changer,'' Dr. Olson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the federal budget proposed by President Obama would not pay for that, certainly not before 2020. After increases in the current year and for fiscal year 2010, Mr. Obama's proposed spending on human exploration in years 2011 through 2013 was several billion dollars less than what President Bush proposed last year. That essentially cut the money to turn the Altair and the Ares V from paper concepts to detailed designs and real spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No bucks, no Buck Rogers,'' Dr. Olson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the hope of many inside and outside NASA is that the Obama administration's budget levels are just placeholders pending the recommendations of the panel reviewing the agency's human space program. Its report is expected by the end of August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel is looking at alternatives to Ares I and Ares V, like adapting existing rockets like the Delta IV for NASA's astronaut needs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another day, another delay for the space shuttleEndeavour. As on Sunday, thunderstorms moved in around the launching pad. NASA has strict rules requiring good weather around both the launching pad and the space center runway in case the shuttle needs to make an emergency landing. ''The weather has just bitten us again,'' said Peter P. Nickolenko, the launching director.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- After months sealed in an isolation chamber, participants in a simulated mission to Mars emerged into a muggy Moscow afternoon on Tuesday, completing what international scientists hope is a small step toward a staffed mission to the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six participants -- four Russians, a German soldier and a French airline pilot -- spent 105 days locked in a series of hermetically sealed tubes as part of the Mars-500 project at the Institute of Biomedical Problems here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An actual staffed mission, if one occurs, could be decades off, but Russian scientists and officials said the Mars-500 project, which will culminate in a 520-day isolation experiment scheduled to start next year, was an indication of Russia's revitalized role in space exploration after years of struggling to keep a foothold in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this time we are moving from the era of preserving Russia's place in space to its advancement,'' Vitaly A. Davydov, the deputy chief of the Russian Federal Space Agency, said at a news conference. ''This is a promising project that will guarantee the orbital deployment of equipment that will fly to the moon and Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars-500 crew conducted about 70 experiments, testing psychological and physical reactions to long-term isolation similar to that expected during interplanetary space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real mission to Mars would last more than 500 cramped, lonely days, most of which would be spent in transit. Adding to the isolation are communication delays with Earth that last up to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international team of scientists drawn from Europe and the United States involved with Mars-500 is seeking ways to avoid the mental breakdowns or worse that could result from such prolonged monotony in part simply by locking people into the Soviet-era isolation chamber and observing what happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From day to day, the work did not stop for a second,'' Aleksei V. Baranov, the mission physician, said after the crew was let out. ''In those minutes when you could relax, you remembered that you were not at home, that you were far from your loved ones, that every day you were supposed to wake up early and work, work, work,'' he said. ''This is difficult to be psychologically prepared for: unceasing, monotonous work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crew members said that tensions were at times unavoidable, though no major conflicts occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project organizers, meanwhile, declared the mission an overall success, but said detailed results from the experiment would be available only after several weeks of analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The results of this experiment show that the basic principles on which we based this experiment were proven correct,'' said Boris V. Morukov, the experiment's director and a former crew member on the International Space Station.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- As the space shuttleEndeavour lifted off into orbit Wednesday evening, several pieces of debris fell off the external fuel tank, and at least one hit the orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts in space and engineers on the ground will spend the next few days examining and analyzing the damage to see if it might pose a danger to the shuttle on re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Columbia disintegrated in 2003, killing the seven astronauts on board, because of damage to its wing caused by falling foam during liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countdown Wednesday proceeded without major glitches, and the weather finally cooperated, with the skies clear after showers early in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching had been delayed five times by hydrogen leaks, schedule conflicts, lightning strikes and rain. That was one short of NASA's record for the number of delays. Two previous missions, in 1986 and 1995, were delayed six times before launching on the seventh try.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Persistence pays off,'' Peter Nickolenko, the launching director, said to crew members a few minutes before launching. ''Good luck and Godspeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A camera on the external tank captured about a dozen pieces of debris falling off the external tank. At least one, coming off about 1 minute 46 seconds after liftoff, hit the orbiter, leaving three marks on the heat-resistant tiles on the underside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't consider those an issue for us,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for space operations, said at a news conference after the launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The white marks were probably just damage to the coating, not deep gouges, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, adding, ''The issues will be in the back of the vehicle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle crew will use a laser scanner at the end of the robotic arm to examine the leading edges of the wings, and then as the orbiter approaches the International Space Station, it will do a flip to allow the station's astronauts to get a good look at the underside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, scheduled to last 16 days, includes five spacewalks dedicated to the construction of the space station. Engineers were also monitoring one of the Endeavour's three fuel cells, which generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen. Water is a byproduct, and one cell did not seem to be removing the water efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tests ''showed we're plenty fine on margin,'' said Michael P. Moses, the launching integration manager. ''I don't expect the fuel cell problem to be any kind of problem at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commander of the Endeavour mission is Mark L. Polansky, a retired Air Force pilot, and the pilot is Lt. Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the Marines. Also aboard are Cmdr. Christopher J. Cassidy of the Navy, Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army, Dr. Thomas H. Marshburn and Dr. David A. Wolf, all of NASA, and Julie Payette of the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Kopra will remain on the space station as a flight engineer while Koichi Wakata of the Japanese Space Agency, who has been in orbit since March, will return to Earth on the Endeavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During liftoff, this crew recorded a space exploration milestone. Before this flight, 498 people had been in space, beginning with Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Colonel Hurley, in the pilot's seat, became No. 499, as the Endeavour passed through the 100-kilometer altitude, the arbitrary boundary of outer space. Because of his seating position, Commander Cassidy was the 500th. Dr. Marshburn and Colonel Kopra, both also first-time fliers, brought the total to 502.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour brought up the final pieces to complete the Japanese laboratory on the space station. The ''front porch'' of the laboratory is to hold experimental samples exposed to the extremes of outer space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Debris that fell from the space shuttleEndeavour's external fuel tank during liftoff on Wednesday probably caused no major damage to the orbiter, NASA officials said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't expect any issues,'' John Shannon, the shuttle program manager, said at a news conference. ''We're not worried about this flight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, because of damage caused by a piece of insulating foam that struck the left wing, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has taken painstaking care to analyze instances of foam falling off during liftoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A camera on the Endeavour's external tank captured at least a dozen instances of falling debris. One large piece, about six inches square, came off 6 minutes 17 seconds into flight, but by that time the shuttle had largely risen out of the atmosphere, and the foam, even if it hit the orbiter, would not have hit with much velocity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But two showers of debris flew off much earlier, one at 1 minute 47 seconds after launching and another eight seconds later. A couple of pieces could be seen hitting the orbiter near the nose, leaving small white spots. Mr. Shannon said the damage there appeared slight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those pieces originated near the camera, perhaps making them look bigger. ''It was dramatic footage looking at it,'' Mr. Shannon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is not yet clear is whether any pieces hit farther to the back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour astronauts spent their first full day in orbit using a camera and laser scanner attached to the end of the shuttle's robotic arm to scan the shuttle's nose cone and the leading edges of the wings. On Friday, as the shuttle approaches the International Space Station for docking, it will perform a backflip to allow the astronauts on the station to photograph its underside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As shown in photographs taken of the external tank after it was jettisoned, most of the missing foam peeled off in strips from the intertank section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was a little bit of a surprise to us,'' Mr. Shannon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fuel tank actually consists of two tanks, one at the top for liquid oxygen and one at the bottom for liquid hydrogen. The intertank is the cylindrical structure connecting the two tanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the intertank is not in contact with either the ultracold liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen, the foam there is thinner -- about half an inch. That also means that it does not experience the same temperature fluctuations; this type of shedding had not been seen before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foam somehow did not adhere properly to the metal structure, and in at least seven or eight places, it came completely off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said that while it did not appear that the Endeavour suffered significant damage, the problem would need to be understood and, if necessary, fixed before the next shuttle flight, of the shuttle Discovery, currently scheduled for Aug. 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, NASA has a new leader. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., a former astronaut, as the new administrator, and Lori B. Garver, a former associate administrator at the agency, as deputy administrator.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>657 words</div><div>18 July 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttleEndeavour docked with the International Space Station on Friday, marking the first time that 13 people have been floating around in one place in outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Endeavour approached, it did a slow back flip to reveal a clean belly, undamaged by the flurry of foam that fell off the external tank on Wednesday during liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm really not surprised,'' the shuttle program manager, John Shannon, said in a news conference Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the foam debris came from the central intertank region between the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks where the foam is only half an inch thick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In reality, they're very low mass, very lightweight,'' Mr. Shannon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers will continue to examine the images, but nothing worrisome has turned up so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday evening, the shuttle and station moved out of the way of a piece of space debris headed their way. The debris, which had been tracked since Thursday, was projected to pass close enough that managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided to fire the shuttle's thrusters at 8:30 p.m. to lift the station by about a mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour docked at the space station Friday at 1:47 p.m. Eastern time. Soon afterwards, Mark L. Polansky of the Air Force, who has been using the Twitter microblogging service to send out updates of the mission, wrote, ''From orbit: Docked successfully w/ISS a few minutes ago. It will take awhile before we can open the hatches, but it's great to be here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After checking for leaks, astronauts opened the final hatch two hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Endeavour's arrival and its crew of seven, a record was set for the most people in orbit on a single space station. A Soyuz spacecraft carried three people to the station in May, doubling the number of permanent crew members to six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the welcome ceremony, Col. Gennady I. Padalka of the Russian Air Force rang the station's bell, a practice transferred from naval traditions. ''It's a remarkable event, not only for us but for the whole space program because this is the next great stage of space station assembly,'' Colonel Padalka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Polansky replied, ''Thank you, Gennady. Thirteen is a pretty big number, but it's going to be an outstanding visit for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there was a lot of crowded hugging, NASA officials said there was plenty of room for everyone on the crew to get their work done. ''It's easy to forget how big the space station has gotten,'' said Paul Dye, the lead flight director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour carried up the final pieces of a Japanese laboratory. The ''front porch'' of the laboratory is to hold experimental samples exposed to the extremes of outer space. The shuttle astronauts will also replace batteries on one of the solar wings. The first spacewalk is planned for Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the shuttle's three fuel cells, which behaved somewhat unusually before launching, continues to exhibit slightly abnormal performance, but ''it's still within the limits,'' Mr. Dye said. ''We're not expecting any problems with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Endeavour escaped damage from the falling foam, the next shuttle flight, of the Discovery, could be delayed as engineers check the external tank that is to be used. If they find the same problems with adhesion of the foam to the tank, shuttle managers could decide to repair the faulty sections or to swap the tank for another one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery flight was scheduled for Aug. 18, but it is likely to slip to at least Aug. 21 because a schedule conflict with a Delta IV rocket, Mr. Shannon said. With the delays in the Endeavour's getting to orbit, a delay of a few days ''makes a lot of sense,'' Mr. Shannon said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans alive today are too young to remember when Apollo 11 landed on the moon 40 years ago on Monday. But for the next several days a remarkable replay of the audio is allowing Internet users to experience the momentous 1969 space mission as it happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original audio feed between mission control and the Apollo 11 spacecraft is being streamed on Wechoosethemoon.org, a presentation of AOL and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA Web site, Nasa.gov, is also streaming a simulcast of the mission. On both sites, the 109 hours of audio started on Thursday and will continue until Monday night. Officials say it is the first such audio stream of a previous space mission, enabled in part by the continuing digitization of NASA's audio records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virtual museum exhibition is a wrinkle of the Web; now we can live (if we weren't alive) or relive (if we were) moments in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a modern way to experience some of the greatest moments in history,'' said Bill Wilson, the president of AOL's content division. He said he expected that the service would try to simulcast similar events in the future, although he did not name specific ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Kennedy library, the Web site started as a project by the <span class="companylink">Martin Agency</span>, which provides pro bono advertising services for the library, to spotlight the 40th anniversary of the moon landing, a goal that Kennedy championed while in office. The resulting Web site showcases photos and animations of the mission, but its defining feature may be the simulcast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faint hum from space is occasionally punctuated by the voices of the crew and the command center. Listeners hear about spacecraft maneuvers, sightings of Earth and even coffee and lunch breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three times during the day on Thursday I found myself shushing people because I wanted to hear how the astronauts were doing,'' Tom McNaught, the deputy director of the library's foundation, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, Mr. McNaught noted, radio listeners and television viewers generally were not able to follow the mission in real time. ''All we saw back then,'' he said, was the spacecraft launch and ''the fuzzy footage that Walter Cronkite showed that night of the walk on the moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Williams, the senior art director at the <span class="companylink">Martin Agency</span>, added, ''It's all the in-between that fills in the gaps that is the most compelling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversations between the astronauts and the ground commanders were transferred from tape to digital form just last March. ''There are thousands and thousands of hours of historical audio that we have on tape that we are digitizing,'' said James Hartsfield, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The audio conversations are now part of an exhibit at the Kennedy library. But they are likely to reach more listeners online; some Web users said they played the audio in the background on Thursday and Friday as they worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The long periods of silence, the static, the times when the crew and Houston can't actually hear each other, brings home how just how much of a step into the unknown this all was,'' Max Brockbank, a resident of London, wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AOL said Wechoosethemoon.org had nearly half a million visits on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-time audio may resonate most with listeners who weren't old enough to remember the actual mission. Mr. Hartsfield, who was 8 at the time of the moon landing, said the simulcast was ''bringing it alive for me.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historians in the distant future are likely to classify humanity's first steps on a world beyond our own as one of the most memorable achievements of the 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's race to the Moon began with the fear that the Soviets had already bested us in space. By the time Neil Armstrong set foot on the Sea of Tranquility -- a broad desolate lunar basin, on July 20, 1969 -- the feat brought a surge of pride and optimism to a nation mired in Vietnam and torn by urban riots and assassinations at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never again would the human space flight program stir such excitement or seem so central to the nation's endeavors. After a few more visits, the Apollo moon program shut down and the manned space program was relegated to shuttle flights in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the question frustrating space enthusiasts is how to rekindle the old days of glory. The answer is not readily apparent. At a confirmation hearing for President Obama's choices to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Senator John Rockefeller IV described the agency as ''a splendid story of the past'' that has been adrift and lost its fascination for Americans. The nominees -- Charles Bolden to be the NASA administrator and Lori Garver to be deputy -- accepted the diagnosis but had trouble explaining how they would reinvigorate the agency beyond pushing harder on safety, research, aeronautics and communicating with the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, it may not be possible to bring more drama to human space flight any time soon. Putting a base on the Moon by 2020, as is currently planned, feels like going back to the scene of the earlier triumph even if the stay this time would be longer. Second acts seldom captivate. And a wholly new conquest, say a landing on Mars, is decades away, if it ever proves feasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Hale, a NASA veteran, blames the old ''Star Trek'' television series, of which he was a fan, for setting expectations too high with visits to interesting planets and challenging interactions with alien species. That's more glamour and excitement than real space travel can provide -- unless, as Mr. Hale observes, we learn to travel at ''warp speed'' as the Trekkers did.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WELL, let's see now ... That was a small step for Neil Armstrong, a giant leap for mankind and a real knee in the groin for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American space program, the greatest, grandest, most Promethean -- O.K. if I add ''godlike''? -- quest in the history of the world, died in infancy at 10:56 p.m. New York time on July 20, 1969, the moment the foot of Apollo 11's Commander Armstrong touched the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was no ordinary dead-and-be-done-with-it death. It was full-blown purgatory, purgatory being the holding pen for recently deceased but still restless souls awaiting judgment by a Higher Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many another youngster at that time, or maybe retro-youngster in my case, I was fascinated by the astronauts after Apollo 11. I even dared to dream of writing a book about them someday. If anyone had told me in July 1969 that the sound of Neil Armstrong's small step plus mankind's big one was the shuffle of pallbearers at graveside, I would have averted my eyes and shaken my head in pity. Poor guy's bucket's got a hole in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why, putting a man on the Moon was just the beginning, the prelude, the prologue! The Moon was nothing but a little satellite of Earth. The great adventure was going to be the exploration of the planets ... Mars first, then Venus, then Pluto. Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus? NASA would figure out their slots in the schedule in due course. In any case, we Americans wouldn't stop until we had explored the entire solar system. And after that ... the galaxies beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had long since been all set to send men to Mars, starting with manned fly-bys of the planet in 1975. Wernher von Braun, the German rocket scientist who had come over to our side in 1945, had been designing a manned Mars project from the moment he arrived. In 1952 he published his Mars Project as a series of graphic articles called ''Man Will Conquer Space Soon'' in Collier's magazine. It created a sensation. He was front and center in 1961 when NASA undertook Project Empire, which resulted in working plans for a manned Mars mission. Given the epic, the saga, the triumph of Project Apollo, Mars would naturally come next. All NASA and von Braun needed was the president's and Congress's blessings and the great adventure was a Go. Why would they so much as blink before saying the word?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months after the landing, however, in October 1969, I began to wonder ... I was in Florida, at Cape Kennedy, the space program's launching facility, aboard a NASA tour bus. The bus's Spielmeister was a tall-fair-and-handsome man in his late 30s ... and a real piece of lumber when it came to telling tourists on a tour bus what they were looking at. He was so bad, I couldn't resist striking up a conversation at the end of the tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, it turned out he had not been put on Earth for this job. He was an engineer who until recently had been a NASA heat-shield specialist. A baffling wave of layoffs had begun, and his job was eliminated. It was so bad he was lucky to have gotten this stand-up Spielmeister gig on a tour bus. Neil Armstrong and his two crew mates, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, were still on their triumphal world tour ... while back home, NASA's irreplaceable team of highly motivated space scientists -- irreplaceable! -- there were no others! ...anywhere! ... You couldn't just run an ad saying, ''Help Wanted: Experienced heat-shield expert'' ... the irreplaceable team was breaking up, scattering in nobody knows how many hopeless directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could such a thing happen? In hindsight, the answer is obvious. NASA had neglected to recruit a corps of philosophers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the moment the Soviets launched Sputnik I into orbit around the Earth in 1957, everybody from Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson on down looked upon the so-called space race as just one thing: a military contest. At first there was alarm over the Soviets' seizure of the ''strategic high ground'' of space. They were already up there -- right above us! They could now hurl thunderbolts down whenever and wherever they wanted. And what could we do about it? Nothing. Ka-boom! There goes Bangor ... Ka-boom! There goes Boston ... Ka-boom! There goes New York ... Baltimore ... Washington ... St. Louis ... Denver ... San Jose -- blown away! -- just like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists were quick to point out that nobody would choose space as a place from which to attack Earth. The spacecraft, the missile, the Earth itself, plus the Earth's own rotation, would be traveling at wildly different speeds upon wildly different geometric planes. You would run into the notorious ''three body problem'' and then some. You'd have to be crazy. The target would be untouched and you would wind up on the floor in a fetal ball, twitching and gibbering. On the other hand, the rockets that had lifted the Soviets' five-ton manned ships into orbit were worth thinking about. They were clearly powerful enough to reach any place on Earth with nuclear warheads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that wasn't what was on President Kennedy's mind when he summoned NASA's administrator, James Webb, and Webb's deputy, Hugh Dryden, to the White House in April 1961. The president was in a terrible funk. He kept muttering: ''If somebody can just tell me how to catch up. Let's find somebody -- anybody ... There's nothing more important.'' He kept saying, ''We've got to catch up.'' Catching up had become his obsession. He never so much as mentioned the rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dryden said that, frankly, there was no way we could catch up with the Soviets when it came to orbital flights. A better idea would be to announce a crash program on the scale of the Manhattan Project, which had produced the atomic bomb. Only the aim this time would be to put a man on the Moon within the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barely a month later Kennedy made his famous oration before Congress: ''I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth.'' He neglected to mention Dryden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INTUITIVELY, not consciously, Kennedy had chosen another form of military contest, an oddly ancient and archaic one. It was called ''single combat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best known of all single combats was David versus Goliath. Before opposing armies clashed in all-out combat, each would send forth its ''champion,'' and the two would fight to the death, usually with swords. The victor would cut off the head of the loser and brandish it aloft by its hair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadly duel didn't take the place of the all-out battle. It was regarded as a sign of which way the gods were leaning. The two armies then had it out on the battlefield ... unless one army fled in terror upon seeing its champion slaughtered. There you have the Philistines when Little David killed their giant, Goliath ... and cut his head off and brandished it aloft by its hair (1 Samuel 17:1-58). They were overcome by a mad desire to be somewhere else. (The Israelites pursued and destroyed them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two millenniums later, the mental atmosphere of the space race was precisely that. The details of single combat were different. Cosmonauts and astronauts didn't fight hand to hand and behead one another. Instead, each side's brave champions, including one woman (Valentina Tereshkova), risked their lives by sitting on top of rockets and having their comrades on the ground light the fuse and fire them into space like the human cannonballs of yore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soviets rocketed off to an early lead. They were the first to put an object into orbit around the Earth (Sputnik), the first to put an animal into orbit (a dog), the first to put a man in orbit (Yuri Gagarin). No sooner had NASA put two astronauts (Gus Grissom and Alan Shepard) into 15-minute suborbital flights to the Bahamas -- the Bahamas! -- 15 minutes! -- two miserable little mortar lobs! -- then the Soviets put a second cosmonaut (Gherman Titov) into orbit. He stayed up there for 25 hours and went around the globe 17 times. Three times he flew directly over the United States. The gods had shown which way they were leaning, all right!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, the mental atmospheres of the rocket-powered space race of the 1960s and the sword-clanking single combat of ancient days became so similar you had to ask: Does the human beast ever really change -- or merely his artifacts? The Soviet cosmo-champions beat our astro-champions so handily, gloom spread like a gas. Every time you picked up a newspaper you saw headlines with the phrase, SPACE GAP ... SPACE GAP ... SPACE GAP ... The Soviets had produced a generation of scientific geniuses -- while we slept, fat and self-satisfied! Educators began tearing curriculums apart as soon as Sputnik went up, introducing the New Math and stressing another latest thing, the Theory of Self-Esteem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last, in February 1962, NASA managed to get a man into Earth orbit, John Glenn. You had to have been alive at that time to comprehend the reaction of the nation, practically all of it. He was up for only five hours, compared to Titov's 25, but he was our ... Protector! Against all odds he had risked his very hide for ... us! -- protected us from our mortal enemy! -- struck back in the duel in the heavens! -- showed the world that we Americans were born fighting and would never give up! John Glenn made us whole again!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his ticker-tape parade up Broadway, you have never heard such cheers or seen so many thousands of people crying. Big Irish cops, the classic New York breed, were out in the intersections in front of the world, sobbing, blubbering, boo-hoo-ing, with tears streaming down their faces. John Glenn had protected all of us, cops, too. All tears have to do with protection ... but I promise not to lay that theory on you now. John Glenn, in 1962, was the last true national hero America has ever had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were three more Mercury flights, and then the Gemini series of two-man flights began. With Gemini, we dared to wonder if perhaps we weren't actually pulling closer to the Soviets in this greatest of all single combats. But we held our breath, fearful that the Soviets' anonymous Chief Designer would trump us again with some unimaginably spectacular feat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, the C.I.A. brought in sketchy reports that the Soviets were on the verge of a Moon shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA entered into the greatest crash program of all time, Apollo. It launched five lunar missions in one year, December 1968 to November 1969. With Apollo 11, we finally won the great race, landing a man on the Moon before the end of this decade and returning him safely to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody, including Congress, was caught up in the adrenal rush of it all. But then, on the morning after, congressmen began to wonder about something that hadn't dawned on them since Kennedy's oration. What was this single combat stuff -- they didn't use the actual term -- really all about? It had been a battle for morale at home and image abroad. Fine, O.K., we won, but it had no tactical military meaning whatsoever. And it had cost a fortune, $150 billion or so. And this business of sending a man to Mars and whatnot? Just more of the same, when you got right down to it. How laudable ... how far-seeing ... but why don't we just do a Scarlett O'Hara and think about it tomorrow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that NASA budget! Now there was some prime pork you could really sink your teeth into! And they don't need it anymore! Game's over, NASA won, congratulations. Who couldn't use some of that juicy meat to make the people happy? It had an ambrosial aroma ... made you think of re-election ....</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's annual budget sank like a stone from $5 billion in the mid-1960s to $3 billion in the mid-1970s. It was at this point that NASA's lack of a philosopher corps became a real problem. The fact was, NASA had only one philosopher, Wernher von Braun. Toward the end of his life, von Braun knew he was dying of cancer and became very contemplative. I happened to hear him speak at a dinner in his honor in San Francisco. He raised the question of what the space program was really all about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a long time, but I remember him saying something like this: Here on Earth we live on a planet that is in orbit around the Sun. The Sun itself is a star that is on fire and will someday burn up, leaving our solar system uninhabitable. Therefore we must build a bridge to the stars, because as far as we know, we are the only sentient creatures in the entire universe. When do we start building that bridge to the stars? We begin as soon as we are able, and this is that time. We must not fail in this obligation we have to keep alive the only meaningful life we know of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, NASA couldn't present as its spokesman and great philosopher a former high-ranking member of the Nazi Wehrmacht with a heavy German accent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the space program has been killing time for 40 years with a series of orbital projects ... Skylab, the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, the International Space Station and the space shuttle. These programs have required a courage and engineering brilliance comparable to the manned programs that preceded them. But their purpose has been mainly to keep the lights on at the Kennedy Space Center and Houston's Johnson Space Center -- by removing manned flight from the heavens and bringing it very much down to earth. The shuttle program, for example, was actually supposed to appeal to the public by offering orbital tourist rides, only to end in the Challenger disaster, in which the first such passenger, Christa McAuliffe, a schoolteacher, perished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years! For 40 years, everybody at NASA has known that the only logical next step is a manned Mars mission, and every overture has been entertained only briefly by presidents and the Congress. They have so many more luscious and appealing projects that could make better use of the close to $10 billion annually the Mars program would require. There is another overture even at this moment, and it does not stand a chance in the teeth of Depression II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why not send robots?'' is a common refrain. And once more it is the late Wernher von Braun who comes up with the rejoinder. One of the things he most enjoyed saying was that there is no computerized explorer in the world with more than a tiny fraction of the power of a chemical analog computer known as the human brain, which is easily reproduced by unskilled labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What NASA needs now is the power of the Word. On Darwin's tongue, the Word created a revolutionary and now well-nigh universal conception of the nature of human beings, or, rather, human beasts. On Freud's tongue, the Word means that at this very moment there are probably several million orgasms occurring that would not have occurred had Freud never lived. Even the fact that he is proved to be a quack has not diminished the power of his Word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July 20, 1969, was the moment NASA needed, more than anything else in this world, the Word. But that was something NASA's engineers had no specifications for. At this moment, that remains the only solution to recovering NASA's true destiny, which is, of course, to build that bridge to the stars.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his day job, Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington studies how stars and planets are born. In recent years, he has consulted with scientists for NASA's Kepler space telescope on their mission of finding planets outside our solar system that might be hospitable to life. Mr. Boss, a 58-year-old astronomer and theoretical astrophysicist, was in New York City recently to promote his new book, ''The Crowded Universe: the Search for Living Planets,'' about the scientific hunt for extraterrestrial life. An edited version of a two-hour conversation follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. ON MARCH 6, A DELTA 2 ROCKET CARRYING THE KEPLER SPACE TELESCOPE WAS LAUNCHED FROM CAPE CANAVERAL. WHAT DID YOU THINK AS YOU WATCHED THE LIFTOFF?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Now we're ready to do some science! The big payoff is coming!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler's mission is to detect planets outside our solar system that roughly have the same size, conditions and distance from their stars as Earth. We think the probability of finding extraterrestrial life would be best on Earth-like planets. From previous observations, we know of about 330 ''extra-solar'' planets. Kepler is likely to send us evidence of hundreds of Earth-like planets revolving around hundreds of Sun-like stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. YOU ARE A BIG BELIEVER IN ''WE ARE NOT ALONE.'' WHY?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. From ground-based observations, we know that Earth-like planets are going to be quite common. Estimates are that ''earths'' probably occur in 10 to 20 percent of the stars. My feeling is that if you have that many earths and you have some prebiotic soup, comets that bring in the organic chemicals that you need to have life, something is going to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might not always end up with dinosaurs and cavemen, but there are going to be planets out there that will have primitive life. Life on Earth is so vigorous and so able to thrive and fill every niche, how could it not be elsewhere? Give life a few billion years and, under the right conditions, something is going to happen, at the very least some sort of primitive bacteria like what we find in the geysers at Yellowstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. WHAT'S YOUR RECIPE FOR ''PREBIOTIC SOUP''?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Proteins, sugars, amino acids, the same sort of things that can be made on the surface of a comet by hitting it with ultraviolet light. Also: water, energy and time. You may want a clay-like surface on the planet, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. SO YOU ARE NOT AN EARTH CHAUVINIST?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Few astronomers are. We understand that we're just a speck of dust in our galaxy in the midst of an incredible universe. As far as we know, the laws of physics work the same everywhere and produce the same conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't have any favorite candidates for where we should look for life, though it makes sense to look at nearby stars. There's a good chance that a large fraction will have habitable planets. If you throw the dart, you're sure to hit something. It's not like you have to go to a hundred stars to hit one. If we even hit five good candidates, I think, we'll probably hit two or three places that could support life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT OTHER LIFE FORMS FROM ELSEWHERE COULD DETECT EARTH'S CIVILIZATION?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The military radar leaving our planet is probably the strongest signal from our planet. If others are looking for us, they could pick up the radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, most of the big ground-based radio telescopes are trying to detect life rather than beam out our presence. In fact, there's an active argument within the extraterrestrial intelligence community as to whether we should be announcing that we're here, instead of just listening quietly. That's associated with worrying about aliens coming to enslave us and kill us. Some people think we should stay quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. WHAT DO YOU THINK?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. That's kind of silly. The speed of light is so fast and distances are so immense between stars that there's zero probability that anybody could come here to invade. Traveling between stars is pretty much the territory of science fiction. With our current best rockets, it would take us 100,000 years to reach the closest star. I wouldn't worry about the interstellar air-raid sirens going off tonight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. ABOUT KEPLER, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY DOUBTS IT WOULD GET OFF THE GROUND?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Oh, sure. One of the themes of my book is about the circuitous route to a launching. NASA has these mission competitions where 30 or 40 ideas compete against one another for one or two launching slots. The thing is like a horse race where people are throwing rocks and the jockeys are elbowing each other. Scientists can be very competitive. They are not afraid to point out flaws in other people's projects. Kepler got shot down two or three times that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central idea for Kepler was to find Earth-like planets by measuring the decrease in brightness of a star when a planet passes in front of it. The competing scientists kept saying you couldn't measure such a tiny change. But a planetary scientist, Bill Borucki, the main figure behind Kepler, showed that the same device that we use in digital cameras could do the job. In fact, Kepler is just a gigantic digital camera hurtling through space. It's also a much more capable camera than a similar one that the French launched two years earlier, which is designed to do other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Always the dark horse in the race, Kepler got its boost when some of the front-running projects were eliminated with Bush administration cuts to NASA. Kepler moved up because it was cheaper and had different sources of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, it's up there and before the year is out, we're going to be finding other worlds. This is a great time to be an astronomer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE AN ASTEROID NAMED FOR YOU. WHAT'S THAT LIKE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's not as splendid as one might think. There are something like 400,000 known asteroids, including, Alanboss, Minor Planet, No. 29137. I believe that Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker found it, and for some reason named it after me. I guess because I was known for work on planet and star formation and they ran out of people to name things after. I've never even seen a picture of my asteroid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As their colleagues on the ground signified the 40th anniversary of a man's stepping onto the Moon's surface, astronauts on the International Space Station tended to a more mundane task: fixing a toilet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pump on the recently installed toilet in the American laboratory, Destiny, broke Sunday, contaminating part of the system. The pump's function was to inject chemicals that helped separate liquids from solid waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Gennady I. Padalka, the station commander, and Frank De Winne, a flight engineer, replaced some of the parts, and the toilet was operational on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interim, the seven astronauts from the space shuttleEndeavour, which docked Friday, had to use the toilet on the shuttle while the six station crew members already aboard the station used a second toilet in the Russian module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other than the plumbing problem, activities aboard the crowded space station continued without major glitches. Dr. David A. Wolf and Dr. Thomas H. Marshburn, both mission specialists, performed the second of five spacewalks planned during the Endeavour's mission, moving spare parts including an antenna and a coolant pump to a storage platform on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the spacewalk, commentary by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration noted the exact moment, 40 years earlier, that the module Eagle with Neil A. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin inside landed on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts ran behind schedule during the spacewalk, and a second task, to install a camera on the Japanese laboratory module, was postponed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anybody get the number of that truck?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers were scrambling to get big telescopes turned to Jupiter on Tuesday to observe the remains of what looks like the biggest smashup in the solar system since fragments of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashed into the planet in July 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something -- probably a small comet -- smacked into Jupiter on Sunday, leaving a bruise the size of the Pacific Ocean near its south pole. Just after midnight, Australian time, on Sunday, Jupiter came into view in the eyepiece of Anthony Wesley, an amateur astronomer in Murrumbateman. The planet was bearing a black eye spookily similar to the ones left in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was a big event,'' said Leigh Fletcher of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ''In the inner solar system it would have been a disaster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as we can see it looks very much like what happened 15 years ago,'' said Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who is director emeritus of the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. The bureau issues bulletins about breaking astronomical news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But astronomers admit they might never know for sure what hit Jupiter. ''It's like throwing a stone on the pond,'' explained Dr. Fletcher. ''You see the splash, but lose the stone. It's the splash we can study.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fletcher said that he and his colleagues were frantically writing proposals for telescope time. Among the telescopes they have recruited is the Hubble Space Telescope, making its early return to the fray after a successful repair mission by astronauts this summer. Mario Livio, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said the group was planning to look at Jupiter's bruise on Thursday and release a picture as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wesley had thought about quitting for the night to watch sports on television, according to the account on his Web site, when he went back outside for another look and found the spot. He e-mailed other astronomers, among them Dr. Fletcher and his colleague Glenn Orton, who had scheduled observing time that night at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility on top of Hawaii's Mauna Kea. Jupiter's ''scar'' showed up in infrared light as a bright spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Franck Marchis, an astronomer at the SETI Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, heard about Mr. Wesley's discovery through the Minor Planet Mailing List and blogged about it on his Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Kalas, another Berkeley astronomer, and Michael Fitzgerald of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, who were then using the Keck II telescope on Mauna Kea next door to the NASA infrared telescope to look for a recently discovered exoplanet, saw the blog and with Dr. Marchis's help, also turned their big eye on Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marchis said the shape of the debris splash as revealed in the Keck images suggested that whatever hit Jupiter might have been pulled apart by tidal forces from the planet's huge gravity before it hit. In an e-mail message, he said humans should be thankful for Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The solar system would have been a very dangerous place if we did not have Jupiter,'' he wrote. ''We should thank our giant planet for suffering for us. Its strong gravitational field is acting like a shield protecting us from comets coming from the outer part of the solar system.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about the recent decline in the frequency of sunspots incorrectly described the research of David Hathaway, a scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. His forecasts for the strength of the solar cycle are based on the magnitude of sunspot-caused disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, not in the Sun's polar magnetic fields.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Two astronauts cut short their spacewalk and hurried back to the International Space Station on Wednesday after a suit problem resulted in rising carbon dioxide levels for one of the men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission Control notified the crew five hours into the spacewalk that the canister for removing carbon dioxide from the suit of one astronaut, Cmdr. Christopher J. Cassidy of the Navy, did not seem to be working properly. Commander Cassidy's fellow spacewalker, Dr. David A. Wolf, returned early to the space station, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two were working on replacing batteries on the solar wings of the space station. The batteries store power collected by the solar wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts' work was left unfinished. Only two of four new batteries were installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work site was more than 150 feet from the hatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, the crew's third in five days, lasted six hours, a half-hour shorter than planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two more are planned, on Friday and Monday. Mission Control said the unfinished battery work from Wednesday would be squeezed into one of the next spacewalks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of astronomers used the newly refurbished Hubble Space Telescope to snap a picture of Jupiter's new black eye on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spot, roughly 5,000 miles long, according to the Hubble team, led by Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., was formed when a small comet or other object crashed into the giant planet on Sunday. It was discovered Sunday night by an amateur astronomer in Australia, Anthony Wesley, who sounded an alert that has had all telescope eyes turning to Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble photo marks a triumphant return to the scientific arena for the fabled telescope, which shut down last September when a computer router failed. It underwent its last orbital overhaul in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble astronomers, who were still in the process of bringing the telescope back on line when Jupiter was smacked, interrupted their methodical procedures to get a snapshot with the new Wide Field Camera 3, which was installed during the May mission and is still not completely calibrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble scientists said they were planning to unveil the rejuvenated telescope with a barrage of new pictures and data in September. But for now the word is out. Hubble is back.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter took a bullet for us last weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An object, probably a comet that nobody saw coming, plowed into the giant planet's colorful cloud tops sometime Sunday, splashing up debris and leaving a black eye the size of the Pacific Ocean. This was the second time in 15 years that this had happened. The whole world was watching when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 fell apart and its pieces crashed into Jupiter in 1994, leaving Earth-size marks that persisted up to a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's Jupiter doing its cosmic job, astronomers like to say. Better it than us. Part of what makes the Earth such a nice place to live, the story goes, is that Jupiter's overbearing gravity acts as a gravitational shield deflecting incoming space junk, mainly comets, away from the inner solar system where it could do for us what an asteroid apparently did for the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Indeed, astronomers look for similar configurations -- a giant outer planet with room for smaller planets in closer to the home stars -- in other planetary systems as an indication of their hospitableness to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Wesley, the Australian amateur astronomer who first noticed the mark on Jupiter and sounded the alarm on Sunday, paid homage to that notion when he told The Sydney Morning Herald, ''If anything like that had hit the Earth it would have been curtains for us, so we can feel very happy that Jupiter is doing its vacuum-cleaner job and hoovering up all these large pieces before they come for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is this warm and fuzzy image of the King of Planets as father-protector really true?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really question this idea,'' said Brian G. Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, referring to Jupiter as our guardian planet. As the former director of the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, he has spent his career keeping track of wayward objects, particularly comets, in the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter is just as much a menace as a savior, he said. The big planet throws a lot of comets out of the solar system, but it also throws them in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for example, Comet Lexell, named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Lexell. In 1770 it whizzed only a million miles from the Earth, missing us by a cosmic whisker, Dr. Marsden said. That comet had come streaking in from the outer solar system three years earlier and passed close to Jupiter, which diverted it into a new orbit and straight toward Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comet made two passes around the Sun and in 1779 again passed very close to Jupiter, which then threw it back out of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was as if Jupiter aimed at us and missed,'' said Dr. Marsden, who complained that the comet would never have come anywhere near the Earth if Jupiter hadn't thrown it at us in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hal Levison, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>, in Boulder, Colo., who studies the evolution of the solar system, said that whether Jupiter was menace or protector depended on where the comets came from. Lexell, like Shoemaker Levy 9 and probably the truck that just hit Jupiter, most likely came from an icy zone of debris known as the Kuiper Belt, which lies just outside the orbit of Neptune, he explained. Jupiter probably does increase our exposure to those comets, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jupiter helps protect us, he said, from an even more dangerous band of comets coming from the so-called Oort Cloud, a vast spherical deep-freeze surrounding the solar system as far as a light-year from the Sun. Every once in a while, in response to gravitational nudges from a passing star or gas cloud, a comet is unleashed from storage and comes crashing inward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter's benign influence here comes in two forms. The cloud was initially populated in the early days of the solar system by the gravity of Uranus and Neptune sweeping up debris and flinging it outward, but Jupiter and Saturn are so strong, Dr. Levison said, that, first of all, they threw a lot of the junk out of the solar system altogether, lessening the size of this cosmic arsenal. Second, Jupiter deflects some of the comets that get dislodged and fall back in, Dr. Levison said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a double anti-whammy,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroids pose the greatest danger of all to Earth, however, astronomers say, and here Jupiter's influence is hardly assuring. Mostly asteroids live peacefully in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, whose gravity, so the standard story goes, keeps them too stirred to coalesce into a planet but can cause them to collide and rebound in the direction of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened, Greg Laughlin of the University of California at Santa Cruz, said, to a chunk of iron and nickel about 50 yards across roughly 10 million to 100 million years ago. The result is a hole in the desert almost a mile wide and 500 feet deep in northern Arizona, called Barringer Crater. A gift, perhaps, from our friend and lord, Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS (PHOTOGRAPHS BY NASA)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRAPHIC: JUPITER TAKES ONE FOR THE TEAM: Last Thursday the Hubble telescope produced these images of a dark, 5,000-mile-wide gash on the gaseous surface of Jupiter. The hole appears to be the result of an object, possibly a comet, smashing into the planet. Jupiter is roughly 11 times the diameter of the Earth, shown approximately to scale with both Hubble images. Comet paths are largely governed by the Sun, which is about 1,000 times more massive than Jupiter. Yet Jupiter can also exert a strong pull on passing objects, so much so that comets colliding with it are probably a common occurrance -- but rarely seen.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the government panel reviewing NASA's human spaceflight program said Tuesday that the life of the International Space Station should be extended past its planned demise in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle Endeavour, which undocked from the space station Tuesday afternoon, returns to Earth, NASA has seven flights left on its schedule before the shuttle fleet is to be retired in September 2010. At that point the space station, under construction since 1998, would finally be complete, but current plans call for operating it only through 2015 before it is deliberately disposed of in the ocean the following year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the Obama administration's charge to the 10-member review panel, which made its recommendation Tuesday at a public hearing in Houston, was to look at extending the station's life. But the panel is also to consider how NASA is to push beyond low-Earth orbit in the coming years and fit the entire program within tight financial constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting was the second held by the panel, which is led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin. At the first meeting, last month in Washington, the members listened to an array of information and opinions from others. On Tuesday, they began debating among themselves what options they will offer to the administration at the end of next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think all the options going forward should continue I.S.S. extension in some form,'' said Sally K. Ride, a former NASA astronaut who was the first American woman in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ride, who led a subcommittee looking at the space station, said the schedule for the remaining seven shuttle flights had little cushion left and was likely to slip into 2011, at an additional cost of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles can carry a far greater load into orbit than any other rockets now in use, and can also bring heavy items back to the ground. ''We're putting I.S.S. in a very fragile situation the moment we retire shuttle,'' Dr. Ride said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With one extra external fuel tank available, one more shuttle flight could be flown in 2012, at a cost of $2.7 billion, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility would be to fly one or two shuttle missions through 2014, Dr. Ride said, but reviving the manufacturing lines used for the shuttle would make sense only if NASA canceled its plans for its next-generation rockets and switched to a shuttle-derived design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another member of the panel, Edward F. Crawley, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cautioned that continuing present programs would delay plans for returning to the Moon or aiming for Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is NASA's conundrum at the highest level,'' Dr. Crawley said, ''which is that the agency really doesn't in its current budgetary structure have the resources to continue a world-class, world-leading space program and also simultaneously develop the next step.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel members will continue their discussions at two more public meetings this week, in Huntsville, Ala., on Wednesday in Cocoa Beach, Fla., on Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel examining the future of the United States' human spaceflight program will suggest that the Obama administration may want to skip the part about landing on other worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could, panel members said Thursday, enable the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to send astronauts to more corners of the solar system more quickly while keeping within a limited budget. But it would also eliminate the possibility of astronauts leaving new iconic footprints on the Moon or Mars for a couple of decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a public meeting in Cocoa Beach, Fla., the 10-member panel discussed at length the possibilities of where NASA might go next and how it might get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the panel discussed NASA's future, NASA's present -- the space shuttleEndeavour and its seven astronauts -- prepared to return on Friday to complete a successful 16-day mission. During five spacewalks, astronauts installed the final pieces of a Japanese laboratory and replaced batteries on a solar wing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the end of the Apollo Moon landings more than three decades ago, NASA, with the space shuttles and now the International Space Station, has toiled in Earth orbit a few hundred miles off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A subcommittee of the panel studied several possibilities, including NASA's current program to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2020, a more ambitious plan to skip the Moon and aim directly for Mars and what the members called the ''flexible path,'' which would avoid the ''deep gravity wells'' of the Moon and Mars, saving the time and cost of developing landers to carry astronauts to the surfaces of those bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward F. Crawley, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who headed the subcommittee, said, ''The flexible path essentially goes across stepping stones'' of progressively longer, more challenging missions by which NASA would learn how to operate long missions in deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flyby of the moon might be followed by more distant trips to so-called Lagrange points, first to the location where the gravity of the Moon and the Earth gravity cancel each other out, then to where the gravity of the Earth and Sun cancel out. There could also be visits to asteroids or flybys of Mars leading to landings on one or both of the low-gravity moons of Deimos and Phobos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach, Dr. Crawley said, would provide ''the most steady cadence of steady improvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach could also improve the capability of robotic explorers on Mars. Instructions from controllers on Earth now take several minutes to reach craft on Mars. But astronauts on a Martian moon could operate robots on the planet in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subcommittee also recommended that NASA establish fueling depots in space. ''You can now do much larger missions with the same size booster'' by launching an empty spacecraft and fueling it in orbit, said Jeff Greason, chief executive of <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> and a panel member. ''It really is a game changer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may even make unnecessary the powerful Ares V rocket now in the planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President George W. Bush proposed his ''vision for space exploration'' in 2004, the program was to receive $108 billion for 2006 to 2020. But Mr. Bush never asked for such financing, and Congress never added money. The financing is now projected at $81.5 billion. If widespread sentiment for extending the life of the International Space Station by five years to 2020 is heeded, the station would consume $10 billion to $14 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In fact, it is unclear whether NASA has the financing for any scenarios that do anything important beyond low-Earth orbit prior to 2020,'' said Christopher F. Chyba, a Princeton professor of astrophysics and a panel member. ''If we really want to do this, we have to provide a realistic budget for it. Otherwise, let's be clear about the limits placed on us by the actual budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel, headed by Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin, will hold two public meetings in Washington next month and will present its final options to the White House by the end of August.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The shuttle Endeavour closed out a grueling 16-day space station assembly mission with a smooth landing here Friday, bringing back to Earth, after four and a half months, the first Japanese astronaut to have engaged in long-duration orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the shuttle approaching from the south after a computer-orchestrated descent, the mission commander, Mark L. Polansky, took over manual control 50,000 feet above the Florida spaceport, banked to line up on Runway 15 and guided the 110-ton craft to a picture-perfect touchdown at 10:48 a.m., Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Polansky and his crew mates left Timothy L. Kopra, an Army colonel, behind on the space station and brought Koichi Wakata back to Earth in his place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wakata, representing the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, flew to the station aboard the shuttle Discovery in March. His stay there was lengthened by a month when the Endeavour's launching was delayed from June 13 to July 15 by technical problems and bad weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As do all astronauts returning from the space station after an extended period, he made the trip back to Earth resting on his back, in a recumbent seat on the Endeavour's lower deck, to ease the transition back to gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at a news conference four hours after landing, on the eve of his 46th birthday, he said, ''I feel great,'' and added that he looked forward to sushi and birthday cake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among his scientific duties and routine maintenance chores, Dr. Wakata also tested bacteria-killing, water-absorbing Japanese underwear designed to be worn in space for weeks at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wore them for about a month, and my station crew members never complained,'' he said Thursday. ''So I think the experiment went fine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swapping station crew members was just one of the goals of the Endeavour's mission. Three members of the shuttle's crew -- Dr. David A. Wolf, Dr. Thomas H. Marshburn and Cmdr. Christopher J. Cassidy of the Navy -- engaged in five spacewalks, attaching an experiment platform to Japan's Kibo lab module, replacing aging solar array batteries and storing critical spare parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts also rewired two of the station's stabilizing gyroscopes, installed television cameras needed for the docking of a Japanese cargo ship in September and deployed a jammed spare-parts mounting mechanism on the station's main truss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only seven shuttle flights remain before the fleet is retired next year, and NASA is launching as many spare parts to the station as possible to protect against failures in the future, when smaller cargo ships may not be able to accommodate large components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Endeavour safely home, NASA will turn its attention to readying the shuttle Discovery for launching around Aug. 25 on a mission to deliver more supplies to the space station, along with Colonel Kopra's replacement, Nicole Stott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers are still assessing what caused an unusual amount of foam insulation to fall from the central section of the Endeavour's external tank during launching more than two weeks ago. Testing has indicated that the Discovery's tank is in good shape, but additional checks were ordered on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If no problems are found, the Discovery will be hauled to its launching pad on Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, the satellite launched by NASA in March to hunt for planets around other stars, found a planet in its first 10 days of operation, astronomers said. Astronomers already knew about the planet from other kinds of observations that swing around a yellow star in Cygnus known as HAT-P-7. This planet is too hot and massive for life, but the ease and precision with which Kepler was able to discern its presence bodes well for the satellite's ability to find more hospitable Earth-like planets, the Kepler astronomers said in a news release and in a paper to be published in the journal Science on Friday. Kepler looks for tiny variations in stars' light caused by the passage of planets in front of them. Astronomers estimate it could take two or three years to find Earth-like planets that are far enough from their stars to keep liquid water on their surface and thus be ''habitable.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logan, Utah -- THE Perseid meteor shower is summer's closing act, arriving in mid-August like clockwork. For centuries, many Christians associated it with the martyred St. Lawrence, whose feast day falls on Aug. 10, so they called the display ''the tears of St. Lawrence.'' By the mid-1800s, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli came to understand that meteor showers are really comet dust -- the ''very minute particles that they have abandoned along their orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteor showers occur when Earth intersects with these so-called debris trains at particular times of the year. In the case of the Perseids, the meteor shower that peaks Wednesday and continues this week, the dust comes from Comet Swift-Tuttle, whose remains appear to shower down from the constellation Perseus as it moves across the northern sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dust may seem less poetic than a saint's tears, but dust has stories to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the solar system begins with dust: Stars died. They exploded. Their remains gathered from far distances to start again. Gravity took hold, and eventually dust, gas, ice and rocks congealed into planets and other objects like comets, which sometimes sprinkle Earth with their debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dust of the Perseids flares up enough to get our attention each August, because it moves through the atmosphere so quickly. Other cosmic dust takes a more gentle stroll. Because their mass is so little relative to their surface area, the smallest particles can actually find their way down to the ground. As Donald Brownlee, an astronomer at the University of Washington who studies cosmic dust particles, has noted, ''If you had lettuce for lunch, you probably ate a few.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, as much as 40,000 tons of dust from space reaches the ground every year. Some of it contains material from stars as well as organic matter -- carbon, amino acids and other building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indo-European base for the word ''dust'' is ''dhus-no,'' which is related to the base for ''fury.'' That seems right. After all, it was a dizzying dust storm some five billion years ago that gave rise to the solar system and, ultimately, to us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, a building block of proteins -- and hence of life as we know it -- has been found in a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That adds to the prevailing notion that many of the ingredients for the origin of life showered down on the early Earth when asteroids (interplanetary rocks orbiting the inner solar system) and comets (dirty ice balls that generally congregate in the outer solar system beyond Neptune) made impact with the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new research, scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md., detected the amino acid glycine in comet bits brought back in 2006 by the NASA space probe Stardust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It tells us more about the inventory of organics in the early solar system,'' said Jamie Elsila, an astrochemist at Goddard who led the research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amino acids are small molecules that, when strung together into chains, form a diversity of proteins. For four decades, scientists have found a multitude of amino acids in some meteorites, the bits of asteroids that land on Earth. More recently, astronomers reported that amino acids might float throughout the cosmos, a belief resulting from their detection of the color signatures of glycine, the simplest of the amino acids, in distant interstellar gas clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some doubts remain about that claim, but if it is true, it would then not be surprising that when the clouds condense into stars and planets, the building blocks of life might be readily available there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for our solar system, meteorite data show that amino acids are present in its inner neighborhood, where asteroids orbit, but until now nothing has been known for certain about what might have formed farther out, where comets gather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Jan. 2, 2004, the Stardust spacecraft flew through the tail of dust and gas of the comet Wild 2 (pronounced vilt two). Two years later, the probe returned to Earth, sending collected samples to the ground by parachute for scientists to analyze. Comets are thought to preserve material of the early solar system, largely unchanged for the last 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few months, the Goddard scientists found glycine embedded in aluminum foil of the collecting apparatus. They had spent the time since then confirming that the glycine indeed came from the comet and not from contamination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not necessarily particularly surprising,'' Dr. Elsila said of her extraterrestrial glycine in a phone conversation Tuesday. ''I would have been surprised if it wasn't there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Elsila and her colleagues were able to show that the glycine from the comet had heavier quantities of the isotope carbon 13 than what occurs on Earth. They also detected a second amino acid, beta-alanine, but the quantities were too minuscule to confirm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings were presented Sunday at a Washington meeting of the American Chemical Society and will be published in the journal Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald E. Brownlee, a professor of astronomy at the University of Washington and principal investigator of the Stardust mission, said the discovery indicated that the chemical reactions that produce glycine, and presumably other amino acids, occurred throughout the early solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That means production of amino acids is fairly common,'' Dr. Brownlee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That had not been a foregone conclusion, he said. Some scientists had suggested that the chemical reactions might have required warm and wet conditions that existed in early asteroids but not comets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Discovery is set for launching next Tuesday at 1:36 a.m., NASA officials said, after long discussions about the state of the insulating foam on the external fuel tank. During the launching of the Endeavour last month, several bursts of foam fell off the external tank. The Endeavour did not suffer any significant damage, but NASA has been careful about since the loss of the Columbia in 2003 when a 2.2-pound chunk of foam punched a hole in its wing and led to the disintegration of the orbiter during reentry. However, tests on the Discovery tank convinced shuttle officials that the foam is adhering properly to the tank and the same problem is not likely to occur. The Discovery is scheduled for a 13-day mission to continue construction of the International Space Station. KENNETH CHANG</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years after it first landed men on the Moon, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has little chance of repeating that accomplishment by the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe not even by the 60th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years after NASA was given a goal of returning to the Moon by 2020, the agency is arriving at an uncomfortable realization -- that the American human spaceflight program might not accomplish anything new anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless the president is willing to step up and take a bold step like President Kennedy did, the manned spaceflight program is going to go in the ditch,'' said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's current plan is to retire the space shuttles by September of next year after completing construction of the International Space Station, then rely on Russian rockets until a next-generation rocket, the Ares I, is ready in March 2015. The agency would then retire and dispose of the space station in 2016 and use the freed-up money to develop the heavy-lift Ares V rocket, a lunar lander and the technology for building a Moon settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plan grew out of the ''vision for space exploration'' that President George W. Bush announced in January 2004, a year after the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its seven astronauts. But in his budget requests, President Bush never asked for as much money as the Moon vision called for, and Congress, despite bipartisan expressions of support for the program, never added the money. President Obama's budget request for the next fiscal year, which starts in October, outlined further cuts in 2011 and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last couple of months, a blue-ribbon panel convened by the Obama administration reached two points of broad consensus. One was that it made little sense to spend 10 years building the space station and then throw it away after only 5 years of operation. The second was at that at present financing levels, about $100 billion for human spaceflight in the decade from 2010 to 2020, the current program was, in the panel's words, ''not executable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, NASA might not reach the Moon's surface even by 2030, the panel concluded. Extending the life of the space station diverted even more money from the Moon efforts. Meeting the current goal of getting back to the Moon by 2020 might require an additional $50 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No alternative plan fits the budget, either, the panel said. ''Our view is that it will be difficult with the current budget to do anything that's terribly inspiring in the human spaceflight area,'' Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin and the panel's chairman, said during its last public meeting on Aug. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now almost everything about NASA's human spaceflight endeavors is again in question -- the rockets, the budget, the schedule, the destination -- and another overhaul could follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes could be radical: scuttling the Ares I rocket that NASA has spent $3 billion developing over the past four years and turning some or all of the space transportation business to private companies. Yet the review has attracted little attention beyond space enthusiasts and politicians with perhaps more parochial concerns -- thousands of jobs in the electoral tipping point of Florida, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that a lot of people care about space a little bit,'' said Bob Werb, chairman of the Space Frontier Foundation, an organization that advocates the settlement of space. ''But it's only a key issue for a small percentage of the population. It's been stated that the support for space is a mile wide and an inch deep, and there's a lot of truth to that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Web site set up for the panel received only 1,500 comments as of the end of July. The question, ''What do you find most compelling about NASA's human space flight activities and why?'' generated just 147 responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The American people have no idea what's going on,'' said Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona and chairwoman of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics. ''The average American does not know the shuttle will go away at the end of 2010.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, getting out of the human spaceflight business entirely does not appear to be under consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a presidential candidate last year, Mr. Obama said he supported the goal of returning to the Moon by 2020. Since becoming president, he has repeatedly said he wants NASA to be inspiring, but not what he thinks an inspiring mission would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the arrival of the panel's final report, now expected in mid-September, Mr. Obama will have to make some key decisions and describe his vision for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first decision is a stark one: whether to increase the money for the human space program to at least $130 billion over the next decade, the level the panel said would be needed, or to pull back the grander ambitions and keep astronauts to low-Earth orbit for the next couple of decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is not a choice the White House wanted,'' Ms. Giffords said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As requested, the panel will offer several options for the administration to consider, not one particular recommendation, and all of the options include compromises like bypassing landing on the Moon and focusing on long-duration space flights, at least initially. That would save the cost of developing a lunar lander and habitat, but Ms. Giffords, for one, said she did not find that plan exciting and doubted that her constituents would either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to deciding where to go, the administration has to decide how to get there. The simplest option would be to continue the current program, but at a slower pace to fit the available financing, reaching the Moon by about 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or Mr. Obama could decide that now is the moment to kick-start the nascent commercial space business. NASA is already counting on private companies to bring up cargo to the space station after the retirement of the shuttles, but another possibility might be canceling the Ares I and turning over all transportation to and from low-Earth orbit to private enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is also unclear whether Congress would go along with wholesale changes. Ms. Giffords said she still supported NASA's current program and was reluctant to throw away its work. A test firing of the first stage of an Ares I engine will take place this week in Utah, and a flight test of a prototype is scheduled later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will cost more money,'' she said. ''It will take more time if we decide to shift gears and use another vehicle.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA called off the launching of the space shuttle Discovery at Cape Canaveral, Fla., because of a bad fuel valve. Officials halted the countdown midway through fueling. The seven astronauts had not yet boarded the shuttle for the scheduled early Wednesday morning flight to the International Space Station. The launching was rescheduled for Friday. A NASA spokesman said engineers were trying to open and shut the fill-and-drain valve in the Discovery's engine compartment when it appeared to be broken. The valve is used for the flow of liquid hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the main engines.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a day of delays for NASA. At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, shuttle managers pushed back the planned launching of the space shuttle Discovery again as they continued to try to work around an issue concerning a fuel valve in the main engines. Instead of 12:22 a.m. Friday, the launch attempt will now be at the end of the day, at 11:59 p.m. Meanwhile, in Utah, a ground test of the first stage of NASA's next generation rocket was called off with only 20 seconds left in the countdown, because of a failure with a hydraulic system that moves the engine nozzle. That test will now occur no earlier than next Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Lighting up the midnight sky, the space shuttle Discovery finally thundered to life late Friday after three launch delays and rocketed away on a 13-day mission to deliver critical supplies and equipment to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running four days late because of bad weather and trouble with a hydrogen valve in the shuttle's engine compartment, Discovery's two solid-fuel boosters ignited with a crackling roar at 11:59 p.m., instantly pushing the spacecraft away from launch pad 39A atop twin torrents of 5,000-degree flame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wheeling about to line up on a northeasterly trajectory, Discovery arced away on a course paralleling the East Coast, putting on a spectacular late night sky show for area residents and tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two minutes after liftoff, the shuttle's boosters fell away, their 1.1 million-pound loads of solid propellant exhausted, and Discovery continued toward orbit under the power of its three main engines, looking like a brilliant star as it dropped toward the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six and a half minutes later, with the shuttle traveling faster than 17,000 m.p.h. -- more than 84 football fields a second -- the powerful engines shut down and Discovery separated from its nearly empty external tank, safely slipping into its planned preliminary orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next two days, the shuttle commander, Col. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marines, and the pilot, Kevin A. Ford, a retired Air Force colonel, plan to carry out a series of rocket firings to catch up with the space station, setting the stage for docking around 9 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Sturckow, Colonel Ford and their crewmates -- Jose M. Hernandez, John D. Olivas, retired Army Col. Patrick G. Forrester, Christer Fuglesang of the European Space Agency and Nicole P. Stott, who will join the space station crew as a flight engineer -- plan to deliver 7.5 tons of supplies, science gear and life support equipment to the laboratory complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with installing a new 1,800-pound ammonia coolant system tank, the astronauts will deliver two research racks, a freezer for experiment samples, a new carbon dioxide removal system, a crew sleep station and a new treadmill named after the comedian Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stott, a shuttle engineer who joined the astronaut corps in 2000, will replace Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army, who traveled to the station last month aboard the shuttle Endeavour. Colonel Kopra will return to Earth aboard the shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery was cleared for takeoff last week after NASA managers concluded that the foam insulation on the ship's external tank was solidly attached and up to the rigors of launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the previous shuttle flight, in July, an unusual amount of insulation fell away from the central section of Endeavour's external tank. While the orbiter's fragile heat shield suffered no major impact damage, NASA managers ordered extensive testing to make sure Discovery's tank was safe to launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In live television views from a camera mounted on the side of the huge tank, the foam appeared to perform as expected during Discovery's climb toward space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will take several days for engineers to fully assess the health of the shuttle's heat shield based on ground-based imagery, data from inspections in orbit and photos shot during final approach to the space station. The 8-inch-wide liquid hydrogen valve that delayed Discovery twice earlier this week worked normally during fueling earlier Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three spacewalks are planned during Discovery's visit before it undocks on Sept. 8 and lands back at the Kennedy Space Center two days later.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW DELHI -- India's national space agency said that communications with its first unstaffed spacecraft to orbit the moon were lost on Saturday and that its scientists were no longer controlling the orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio contact with the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was abruptly lost at 1:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, said S. Satish, a spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research</span> Organization. The agency's monitoring unit near the southern city of Bangalore was no longer receiving data from the spacecraft, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching of Chandrayaan-1 last October put India in an elite club of countries with moon missions: the United States, Russia, Japan, China and members of the European Space Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was part of India's effort to assert its power in space and claim some of the business opportunities there. One focus was to prospect the lunar surface for natural resources, including uranium for nuclear fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project aimed to increase India's capacity to build more efficient rockets and satellites, especially through miniaturization, and open research avenues for young scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, which is not intended to land on the moon, had completed more than 3,400 orbits of the moon over 312 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are studying the telemetry data and trying to figure out what is the problem,'' Mr. Satish said. The space agency had received a great deal of data from the spacecraft, and most of the scientific objectives of the mission had been met, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft had been controlled from a monitoring center southwest of Bangalore, which sent it commands to change direction and speed and to focus its cameras. Mr. Satish said it was no longer receiving commands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $80 million lunar spacecraft has had other problems. In May, it lost a critical instrument called a star sensor. Two months later, it overheated, but scientists were able to resume operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India plans to follow the Chandrayaan, which means ''moon craft'' in Sanskrit, by landing a rover on the moon in 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tempe, Ariz. -- NOW that the hype surrounding the 40th anniversary of the Moon landings has come and gone, we are faced with the grim reality that if we want to send humans back to the Moon the investment is likely to run in excess of $150 billion. The cost to get to Mars could easily be two to four times that, if it is possible at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the issue being wrestled with by a NASA panel, convened this year and led by Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin, that will in the coming weeks present President Obama with options for the near-term future of human spaceflight. It is quickly becoming clear that going to the Moon or Mars in the next decade or two will be impossible without a much bigger budget than has so far been allocated. Is it worth it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most challenging impediment to human travel to Mars does not seem to involve the complicated launching, propulsion, guidance or landing technologies but something far more mundane: the radiation emanating from the Sun's cosmic rays. The shielding necessary to ensure the astronauts do not get a lethal dose of solar radiation on a round trip to Mars may very well make the spacecraft so heavy that the amount of fuel needed becomes prohibitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, however, a way to surmount this problem while reducing the cost and technical requirements, but it demands that we ask this vexing question: Why are we so interested in bringing the Mars astronauts home again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the idea of sending astronauts aloft never to return is jarring upon first hearing, the rationale for one-way trips into space has both historical and practical roots. Colonists and pilgrims seldom set off for the New World with the expectation of a return trip, usually because the places they were leaving were pretty intolerable anyway. Give us a century or two and we may turn the whole planet into a place from which many people might be happy to depart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, one of the reasons that is sometimes given for sending humans into space is that we need to move beyond Earth if we are to improve our species' chances of survival should something terrible happen back home. This requires people to leave, and stay away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more immediate and pragmatic reasons to consider one-way human space exploration missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, money. Much of the cost of a voyage to Mars will be spent on coming home again. If the fuel for the return is carried on the ship, this greatly increases the mass of the ship, which in turn requires even more fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, has offered one possible solution: two ships, sent separately. The first would be sent unmanned and, once there, combine onboard hydrogen with carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere to generate the fuel for the return trip; the second would take the astronauts there, and then be left behind. But once arrival is decoupled from return, one should ask whether the return trip is really necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely if the point of sending astronauts is to be able to carry out scientific experiments that robots cannot do (something I am highly skeptical of and one of the reasons I don't believe we should use science to attempt to justify human space exploration), then the longer they spend on the planet the more experiments they can do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, if the radiation problems cannot be adequately resolved then the longevity of astronauts signing up for a Mars round trip would be severely compromised in any case. As cruel as it may sound, the astronauts would probably best use their remaining time living and working on Mars rather than dying at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sounds unrealistic to suggest that astronauts would be willing to leave home never to return alive, then consider the results of several informal surveys I and several colleagues have conducted recently. One of my peers in Arizona recently accompanied a group of scientists and engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on a geological field trip. During the day, he asked how many would be willing to go on a one-way mission into space. Every member of the group raised his hand. The lure of space travel remains intoxicating for a generation brought up on ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We might want to restrict the voyage to older astronauts, whose longevity is limited in any case. Here again, I have found a significant fraction of scientists older than 65 who would be willing to live out their remaining years on the red planet or elsewhere. With older scientists, there would be additional health complications, to be sure, but the necessary medical personnel and equipment would still probably be cheaper than designing a return mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delivering food and supplies to these new pioneers -- along with the tools to grow and build whatever they need, for however long they live on the red planet -- is likewise more reasonable and may be less expensive than designing a ticket home. Certainly, as in the Zubrin proposal, unmanned spacecraft could provide the crucial supply lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest stumbling block to a consideration of one-way missions is probably political. NASA and Congress are unlikely to do something that could be perceived as signing the death warrants of astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, human space travel is so expensive and so dangerous that we are going to need novel, even extreme solutions if we really want to expand the range of human civilization beyond our own planet. To boldly go where no one has gone before does not require coming home again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts aboard the orbiting shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station will soon part company. The 13 space travelers had a final job to accomplish together before the hatches between their spacecraft were closed, transferring a moving van holding a ton of trash and discarded equipment back aboard the Discovery. It was delivered by the shuttle, fully loaded with supplies, and moved onto the space station last week. The shuttle will undock on Tuesday and is due back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blue-ribbon panel said Tuesday that a lack of financing has left NASA's current space program on an ''unsustainable trajectory'' and that the Obama administration should consider using private companies to launch people into low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel, convened in May in response to a request by President Obama, delivered an executive summary of its report to the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The full report is expected later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summary contains few surprises, but neatly compacts to 12 pages the discussions of a series of public meetings in July and August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whatever space program is ultimately selected, it must be matched with the resources needed for its execution,'' the panel wrote, emphasizing the possibilities of pulling in participation and financing from other nations and turning to the commercial space industry to provide rockets at a lower cost than a program by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA will be working with the administration to determine how best to shape our human space flight efforts for the future,'' said Michael Cabbage, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With growing federal deficits and bruising battles over health care, it is unclear how much political capital Mr. Obama might spend on expanding the budget for the space agency. In addition, Congress, which supported the current program proposed by President George W. Bush in 2004, might not accede with another overhaul of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials have not publicly given any hints of what course it will probably pursue. Nicholas Shapiro, a White House spokesman, said the president was committed to human spaceflight. ''Until the options are thoroughly considered,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''it would be premature for anyone to draw conclusions from the committee's work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, under its Constellation program, is developing a new rocket called Ares I and a new astronaut capsule called Orion, and the system is to begin carrying astronauts to the International Space Station in March 2015. After that, development of a larger rocket, the Ares V, and a lunar lander was to lead to a return to the moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said that those plans were ''reasonable'' when they were announced in 2005, but that largely because NASA never received the expected financing, the first manned flight of Ares I would probably be delayed until 2017, and the International Space Station is to be discarded by 2016 under current plans. And the projected financing for NASA would not allow enough money for development of Ares V and the Altair lunar lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel in fact could find no program that ''permits human exploration to continue in any meaningful way'' within the $100 billion for human spaceflight over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $30 billion more, the current Constellation program is feasible, but would still not reach the moon until 2025, the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel asserted that it would be ''unwise'' to throw away the space station in 2015 after only five years of full operation, but that operating the space station would draw away money from the rest of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, the other four options that the panel presented call for replacing Ares I with a commercial alternative, possibly a variation of the rockets that launch military payloads or a new spacecraft from the start-up company <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elon Musk, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, said his company could complete development of a version of its Falcon 9 rocket capable of carrying astronauts into orbit within three years of signing a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the question of rockets is one of destination. The ultimate goal is Mars, but that is currently not practical, the panel said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cosmic postcards are back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers on Wednesday unveiled new pictures and observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. With the exception of a picture last month of the bruise on Jupiter caused by a comet, they were the first data obtained with the telescope since a crew spent 13 days in orbit last May replacing, refurbishing and rebuilding its vital components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is truly Hubble's new beginning,'' Edward Weiler, the associate administrator for science at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said at a news conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event, which included Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, and the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who is retired from the Marine Corps, was a mix of science and celebration of the human spirit and innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm in awe of the human ingenuity that could conceive of such a thing and then make it happen,'' said K. Megan McArthur, an astronaut who flew on the repair mission last spring</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., said, ''We're giddy with the quality of the data we're getting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the images were gas flying from a dying star that looked like a butterfly spreading its wings, and a galaxy nearly 10 billion light-years away whose image had been stretched and magnified by the gravity of a cluster of galaxies into a ''dragon'' shape. Examining such images, astronomers can study details of galaxies that existed before the Milky Way was born and chart the distribution of mysterious dark matter in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Weiler noted that the telescope was now in the best shape of its 19-year life in orbit, far surpassing the ambitions of its founders, and that it could last for at least another five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hubble gets better and better and better,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope has had almost as many reincarnations as a cat. It was born in a vision of Lyman Spitzer, a Princeton astronomer who realized in 1946 that a telescope in space above the blurring effects of the atmosphere could make more precise measurements of stars, as well as see infrared and ultraviolet radiation that cannot make it through air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched with great fanfare from the space shuttle in 1990, the telescope became a national joke when it was discovered that its primary mirror had been painstakingly polished to the wrong shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mistake was so simple, however, that it could be repaired. In 1993, an astronaut crew installed corrective optics on the telescope, and the heavens snapped into focus. Astronauts have visited the telescope four more times in a series of increasingly ambitious servicing missions, and the telescope became increasingly powerful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of the final servicing mission, only one of the telescope's three cameras was working and its spectrograph had shut down. In May, a crew from the shuttle Atlantis installed a new camera and spectrograph and repaired the other spectrograph and the telescope's prime camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys, among other tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job was almost a complete success. The exception was that the astronauts were unable to restore a high-resolution capability on the survey camera. It is mostly used in a wide-field mode, astronomers say, but one of the more exciting Hubble pictures recently was a high-resolution image of a planet orbiting the star Fomalhaut obtained by Paul G. Kalas of the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, David S. Leckrone, longtime Hubble senior scientist, announced that another of the telescope's instruments, an infrared camera known as Nicmos that had been dormant but that had not been worked on by the astronauts, was now back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Leckrone said he was proud to report that there were no problems with the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somehow,'' he said, addressing the entire NASA and astronomical community, ''you guys managed to pull it off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Weiler, the NASA associate administrator, thanked the 32 astronauts ''who have risked their lives flying up to Hubble and keeping the scientists happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked their reactions to seeing the new pictures, most of the astronauts who were on the mission in May said some version of ''wow.'' Michael J. Massimino, who performed two spacewalks then, said, ''Thank God we didn't break it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Stormy Florida weather forced the shuttle Discovery astronauts to delay re-entry Thursday, but the Japanese space agency had better luck, successfully launching a powerful new rocket carrying an unmanned cargo ship on a $680 million maiden voyage to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loaded with 7,400 pounds of experiment hardware and supplies, the Japanese H.T.V. cargo craft represents a milestone for the station program, an effort to give the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its international partners another way to deliver crucial equipment after the space shuttles are retired next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 184-foot-tall H-2B rocket roared to life on time at 1:01 p.m. Eastern time and quickly climbed away from launching pad No. 2 at the Tanegashima Space Center on the coast of southern Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powered by four solid-fuel strap-on boosters and a pair of hydrogen-fueled first-stage engines, the 1.2-million-pound rocket arced away to the southeast, trailing a churning cloud of exhaust and a brilliant plume of flame, lighting up the night sky before disappearing into a deck of low clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen minutes after liftoff, the cargo ship slipped into its planned preliminary orbit, prompting enthusiastic applause in the Japanese control center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a different story in Florida, where afternoon thunderstorms and blustery crosswinds forced flight controllers in Houston to delay the Discovery's planned re-entry and landing to close out another space station resupply mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more bad weather expected through the weekend in Florida, NASA held open the option of diverting the shuttle's crew to Edwards Air Force Base, in California, on Friday or Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts delivered nine tons of equipment and supplies to the space station. During three spacewalks, they also installed a new 1,800-pound ammonia coolant tank, deployed a cargo attachment mechanism, retrieved two external experiments and made preparations for attachment of a new module next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flight controllers with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, meanwhile, planned to spend the next week testing the H.T.V.'s systems and practicing abort procedures while carrying out a series of rendezvous rocket firings to catch up with the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the shuttle, Russian Soyuz and Progress capsules and the European Space Agency's automated transfer vehicle, the H.T.V. was not designed to dock with the space station on its own. Instead, the ship will maneuver to a point directly below it and then wait for the station crew to grab it with the station's robot arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, the spacecraft will be moved to the Harmony module's Earth-facing port and locked in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On this particular flight, we've got about two-and-a-half tons of pressurized cargo flying to orbit and almost a metric ton of payloads externally coming to I.S.S.,'' said Michael T., the space station program manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JAXA plans to build and launch one H.T.V. craft per year, although the agency could support two flights annually if necessary.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With ferocious flames and smoke in the barren Utah hills north of Salt Lake City, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Thursday successfully test fired the first stage of a new rocket that might soon be canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firing, performed at <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems, Inc</span>., the manufacturer of the motor, was the first full-scale demonstration of a major component of the Ares I rocket that NASA has been developing for the past four years to replace the space shuttles, which are scheduled to be retired next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first effort at the $75 million test, on Aug. 30, was halted with 20 seconds left in the countdown because of a faulty valve in a power unit that steers the nozzle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the countdown proceeded smoothly, and the motor, the largest and most powerful in the world today, ignited at 1 p.m., Mountain time. Securely fixed in a horizontal position, the motor did not go anywhere, shooting its 4,500-degree exhaust at a speed three times that of sound into a pile of sand and turning it to glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over two minutes later, after reaching a maximum thrust of 3.6 million pounds, the motor exhausted the fuel and fell quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary data ''is absolutely consistent with our expectations of what we thought we were going to get,'' said Alex Priskos, the manager of the first stage of Ares I development at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. ''So that was fantastic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The motor is essentially a stretched version of the solid rocket boosters used by the shuttles, and NASA chose the design in 2005 claiming that the simplicity of the design -- a single solid fuel motor in the first stage without the complicated plumbing of liquid fuel engines -- would make the Ares I safer than any other rocket for astronauts. The reusable casings of the motor tested Thursday were in fact used on shuttle launchings; one flew on the first shuttle flight, in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers will spend weeks analyzing the test data, which includes the thrust, vibrations and forces on the motor. The current schedule calls for three more test firings as the design is modified and improved and then two firings of the final design to verify its reliability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those tests may never occur. While the firing on Thursday went smoothly, it may mark the beginning of the end for Ares I. A blue-ribbon panel reviewing the human spaceflight program included the Ares I in only one of the options it is presenting to the Obama administration. Panel members expressed skepticism about the need for the Ares I as it would most likely not be ready until 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same motor could be used for the planned larger Ares V rocket, but it is also just one of several possibilities. The executive summary of the panel's report was released Tuesday, and the full report is expected later this month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery glided to a day-late Mojave Desert touchdown Friday, leaving a fresh crew member and nine tons of equipment and supplies behind aboard the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bringing another astronaut home after two months in space, the shuttle settled to a flawless landing on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base just north of Los Angeles to close out a successful two-week resupply mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts had hoped to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but showers and thunderstorms blocked two efforts on Thursday and two more Friday. With an equally poor forecast for Saturday, the entry flight director, Richard Jones, diverted the Discovery to Edwards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flying upside down and backward over the southern Indian Ocean, Col. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marines, the commander, and Kevin A. Ford, the pilot and a retired Air Force colonel, fired the shuttle's twin braking rockets at 7:47 p.m. Eastern time to begin the hourlong descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approaching from the southwest, Colonel Sturckow monitored a steep computer-controlled descent across the Los Angeles Basin before taking manual control 50,000 feet above the Mojave Desert and guiding the shuttle to a crisp landing at 8:53 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston, Discovery, wheels stopped,'' he radioed when the shuttle coasted to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Welcome home, Discovery. Congratulations on an extremely successful mission, stepping up science to a new level on the International Space Station,'' Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force replied from mission control in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Sturckow, Mr. Ford and the other astronauts -- Jose M. Hernandez; John D. Olivas; Col. Patrick G. Forrester of the Army, retired; Christer Fuglesang of Sweden; and Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army -- planned to fly back to Houston on Saturday for reunions with friends and family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Kopra made the trip back to Earth resting on his back in a recumbent seat to ease his return to gravity after 58 days in space. Flight surgeons were standing by to assist and collect medical data on his re-adaptation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This experience has completely exceeded anything that I thought it would be like, just the sights, the sounds, the experiences with a great crew,'' Colonel Kopra said last week, adding that the main thing he was looking forward to was ''seeing my family again, my wife and two kids -- and maybe have a sip of a beer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole P. Stott replaced Colonel Kopra on the space station and is to remain there until the next shuttle visit, in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Sturckow and his crewmates delivered nine tons of equipment and supplies to the station, including two experiment racks, a sample freezer, a second treadmill, a crew sleep station and a carbon dioxide removal system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During three spacewalks, they also installed a new 1,800-pound ammonia coolant tank, deployed a cargo attachment mechanism, retrieved two external experiments and made preparations for attachment of a new module next year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Members of a key House committee said Tuesday that they were reluctant to change NASA's current plans for human spaceflight after the space shuttles are retired from service, beyond giving more money to the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that good public policy argues for setting the bar pretty high against making significant changes in direction at this point,'' said Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology. ''There would need to be a compelling reason to scrap what we've invested our time and money in over these past four years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon's remarks came during the first Congressional hearing on a new report that offers options for the future of astronauts in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is developing a new series of rockets to replace the space shuttles, which are scheduled to be retired next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has not offered public support for the rockets, which are part of the agency's Constellation program, and in May convened a panel to review the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin who led the 10-member review panel, encountered a sometimes testy atmosphere in his appearance before the committee on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am pretty angry,'' said Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, who heads the committee's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giffords said she had been hoping for a detailed evaluation of Constellation and recommendations for how to improve it. Instead, she said, the panel had provided a menu of potential replacements for the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a glancing attention to Constellation, even mentioning it in past tense,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Augustine said the panel had done what had been requested -- provide a list of options, not a preferred recommendation -- and noted that the Constellation program was one of the five options offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe the existing program is a fine program,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel issued a 12-page summary last week, and Mr. Augustine said it would try to complete the report this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Committee members agreed with Mr. Augustine on a central conclusion of the panel: NASA needs about $3 billion more a year -- increasing the spending over the next decade on human spaceflight to $130 billion from $100 billion -- or it will not be able to accomplish the goals of Constellation or any alternative program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without an increase, Mr. Augustine said, NASA could continue to operate the International Space Station and develop some new technology, but it would not get out of Earth orbit for the foreseeable future. ''It will be a program that will inspire very few people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A smaller increase of $1.5 billion a year was also insufficient, the panel concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, it said that none of the options appreciably shortens the gap between the retirement of the shuttles -- when the United States will rely on Russia for transportation to and from the International Space Station -- and the development of the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares, the first of the Constellation rockets, will not be ready for use until at least 2015, and the panel predicted that the schedule would slip to 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Augustine, who spent two hours before the House committee, will be questioned by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also testifying to the House committee on Tuesday were Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who stepped down in January with the change in administrations, and Joseph W. Dyer, a retired vice admiral who is chairman of the aerospace advisory panel at NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin agreed that the fundamental issue is money, pointing out that NASA's budget was cut 20 percent in 1994. In inflation-adjusted dollars, NASA's budget is lower than it was in 1993. ''I think we're here today because we don't like how that experiment turned out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cancel Ares I and rely on commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit, a suggestion made by the review panel, would be ''risky in the extreme,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''That day is not yet and is not soon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin also said that NASA had been much more careful in preparing its cost estimates for Constellation and that the review panel had not taken that into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dyer said that the safety panel did not support extending operations of the space shuttle, another of the options offered by the review panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that NASA had not held detailed conversations with commercial companies about what would be necessary to make their rockets sufficiently safe for passengers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shadowy craters near the south pole of the Moon may be the coldest places in the solar system, colder even than Pluto, NASA scientists said as they unveiled some of the first findings from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. The orbiter, launched in June, officially began its one-year mission to map the Moon's surface this week. But it had begun returning data during three months of testing and calibration. Among the data, thermal measurements showed that daytime temperatures over much of the surface reached 220 degrees before plummeting at night. But the bottoms of the craters, which lie in permanent darkness, never warm above minus 400 degrees. Those ultracold temperatures have trapped and held deposits of ice for several billion years. The ice could prove a valuable resource to future explorers, not only drinking water but also, when the water molecules are broken apart, hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is twilight time on Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shadows lengthened to stretch thousands of miles across the planet's famous rings this summer as they slowly tilted edge-on to the Sun, which they do every 15 years, casting into sharp relief every bump and wiggle and warp in the buttery and wafer-thin bands that are the solar system's most popular scenic attraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From her metaphorical perch on the bridge of the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn for five years, Carolyn Porco, who heads the camera team, is ecstatic about the view. ''It's another one of those things that make you pinch yourself and say, 'Boy am I lucky to be around now,' '' Dr. Porco said. ''For the first time in 400 years, we're seeing Saturn's rings in three dimensions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Dr. Porco and the Cassini team released a grand view of the rings in all their shadowed glory, including clumps, spikes, undulations and waves two and a half miles high on the edge of one ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We always knew it would be good; instead, it's been extraordinary,'' Dr. Porco said of the cascade of results that have placed her in a spotlight to which she has become increasingly accustomed. ''I feel I'm on a great human adventure,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work may be carried out by robots, Dr. Porco said, ''but we are all explorers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's thrilling,'' she added, ''and I want everyone to know how thrilling it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco, 56, a senior researcher at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., may be the leader of the camera team on the $3.4 billion Cassini mission, an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado and one of Wired magazine's 15 people who should be advising the president. But she is also a proud child of the 1960s who has never let go of the exuberance of that era when President John F. Kennedy ''said that the sky isn't even the limit,'' as she puts it, and ''things were unleashed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her entries on the Cassini imaging Web site echo the spirit of the character Capt. James T. Kirk on ''Star Trek'':</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain's Log</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March 23, 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are almost there. Saturn and we, its companions, have journeyed together now for nearly five years, in a circumnavigation of the outer solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanley Kubrick's film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' is still her favorite movie, and she still loves the Beatles. On a visit to England in 2001, she and her imaging colleagues recreated the album cover picture of the Beatles crossing Abbey Road, with Dr. Porco leading, dressed in white like John Lennon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco was born and raised in a Bronx family with four brothers she partly credits for her subsequent success in astronomy. ''I'm used to fighting and arguing with males,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father, an Italian immigrant, drove a bread truck, and her mother kept house. Dr. Porco attended Cardinal Spellman High School, the same school that Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court attended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was a studious child and a spiritual seeker -- ''13 going on 80'' -- who lived a lot in her head. Later, as a student at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, she said she spent two years as a chanting Buddhist and even went on a two-week pilgrimage to Japan, where she was the majorette in a Buddhist marching band, wearing hot pants. ''Now, THOSE were the days,'' she wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, Dr. Porco was pursuing the future she had glimpsed at age 13 when she saw Saturn through a neighbor's rooftop telescope. As a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, she floundered at first but then got a job helping to analyze data from the two Voyager spacecrafts, which toured the outer planets from Jupiter to Neptune from 1978 to 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was there, said Peter Goldreich, her thesis advisor, that she demonstrated a knack for picking out important things. Among them was a discovery that mysterious dark spokes in Saturn's ring system were connected to the planet's magnetic field. She did her thesis on aspects of the rings and how they were shaped by the gravity of tiny moonlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco also did a lot of dancing, and played a guitar and sang in the Titan Equatorial Band, a pickup group of scientists and science writers named after a feature on Saturn's largest moon, and later for a group in Tucson called the Estrogens. ''Three women and one very brave guy,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Voyager passed Neptune in 1989, Dr. Porco was a research associate at the University of Arizona and leading a small team trying to make sense of the thin rings around Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She was one of the young rock stars of Voyager,'' said David Grinspoon, of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, who was a graduate student at Arizona at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it had not been an easy climb in the overwhelmingly male and competitive environment of space science. Dr. Porco once described scientists as ''schoolyard toughs.'' She recalled pumping herself up to be an ''alpha male'' before meetings of her ring team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as a graduate student, Dr. Goldreich recalled, Dr. Porco ''was making a deliberate effort to become tough, and she succeeded.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco found an ally and friend in Carl Sagan, the Cornell astronomer, author and a charter member of the Voyager team, who defended her once when her Voyager colleagues teased her about not being married.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco was subsequently hired as a consultant for the movie ''Contact,'' based on Sagan's novel about a feisty astronomer, Ellie Arroway, who discovers a signal from extraterrestrials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although plans fell through for Dr. Porco to meet Jodie Foster, the actress who played Arroway, she did attend a workshop on the script, where she took strong exception to an idea that the character would sleep with her adviser. ''She's a let-it-ripper, isn't she?'' recalled the movie's producer, Lynda Obst. ''She let it rip.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager, Dr. Porco said, was the time of her life. ''It had all the elements of Homeric legend,'' she said. ''It was a long 12-year odyssey, punctuated by brief episodes of great discovery and conquest. And then it was back in the boat, oars in the water, until years later we reached our next port of call. It was a defining experience for many of us, and certainly for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance to channel Dr. Porco's inner Captain Kirk continued with the $3.4 billion Cassini mission, which was launched on a roundabout course toward Saturn in 1997 and arrived in 2004. Being on the imaging team is like standing on the bridge of the spaceship, she said. ''We have the windows,'' she said. ''That's what we're responsible for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco was chosen over more senior astronomers to head the Cassini camera team in 1990, one of 12 team leaders for the spacecraft. The job swallowed her life, she said, and required her hard-won toughness. ''Our experiment has been spectacularly successful,'' she said, ''and that would never have happened if I let people roll over me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Porco said it had all been worthwhile. ''Between my participation in Voyager and my role in Cassini,'' she said, ''when comes the time, I will die a happy and gratified woman.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most thrilling Cassini moments was in 2004 when the Huygens probe detached from Cassini and landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, a strange, frigid world where rocks are made of ice, and rivers and oceans are formed of what Dr. Porco has described as ''paint thinner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, astronomers announced that they had detected methane storms on Titan, a cloudy moonthat has an atmosphere denser than that of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also discovered plumes erupting from the south pole of another Saturn moon, Enceladus, suggesting the presence of underground water and prompting talk about a future mission to cruise through the plumes. ''Should we ever discover that life has arisen twice,'' Dr. Porco said, ''that would be a game-changer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Titan landing, Dr. Porco said in a talk in 2007, should have been celebrated with parades in every major city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That talk led to another movie adventure. J. J. Abrams, the producer of the television series ''Lost,'' was listening and asked Dr. Porco to consult on his ''Star Trek'' movie. On a visit to the set, she suggested that a scene in which the Starship Enterprise materialized inside clouds be set on Titan. The scene made it onto the cover of Cinefex, a magazine about special effects in films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Abrams said: ''She helped us feel connected to what Gene Roddenberry had been trying to do. This is our future,'' referring the creator of ''Star Trek.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini endures, and Dr. Porco is a member of the team for the New Horizons spacecraft, which is scheduled to arrive at Pluto in 2015. But she said she hoped to spend more of her time popularizing science and hopes to write a book about Cassini.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To my mind,'' Dr. Porco said, ''most people go through life recoiling from its best parts. They miss the enrichment that just a basic knowledge of the physical world can bring to the most ordinary experiences. It's like there's a pulsating, hidden world, governed by ancient laws and principles, underlying everything around us -- from the movements of electrical charges to the motions of the planets -- and most people are completely unaware of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, that's a shame.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There appears to be, to the surprise of planetary scientists, water, water everywhere on the Moon, although how many drops future astronauts might be able to drink is not clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from three spacecraft indicate the widespread presence of water or hydroxyl, a molecule consisting of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom as opposed to the two hydrogen and one oxygen atoms that make up a water molecule. The discoveries are being published Thursday on the Web site of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so startling because it's so pervasive,'' said Lawrence A. Taylor of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, a co-author of one of the papers that analyzed data from a National Aeronautics and Space Administration instrument aboard India's Chandrayyan-1 satellite. ''It's like somebody painted the globe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the Moon has been regarded as a completely dry place. The dark side is more than ice cold, but when it passes into sunlight, any ice should have long ago been baked away. The possible exceptions are permanently shadowed craters near the Moon's poles, and data announced this month by NASA verified the presence of hydrogen in those areas, which would most likely be in the form of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If water is somehow more widespread, that could make future settlement of the Moon easier, especially if significant water could be extracted just by heating the soil. Oxygen would also be a key component for breathable air for astronauts, and hydrogen and oxygen can also be used for rocket fuel or power generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samples of lunar soil brought back from NASA's Apollo missions about four decades ago actually did show signs of water, but most scientists working with the samples, including Dr. Taylor, dismissed the readings as contamination from humid Houston air that seeped in before the rocks were analyzed at NASA's Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was one of the ones back in the Apollo days that was firmly against lunar water,'' Dr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he is convinced he was wrong. ''I've eaten my shorts,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chandrayyan-1 data looked at sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface and found a dip at a wavelength where water and hydroxyl absorb infrared light. Dr. Taylor estimated the concentration at about one quart of water per cubic yard of lunar soil and rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Roger N. Clark of the United States Geological Survey analyzed decade-old data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft when it passed the Moon en route to Saturn. He, too, found signs of water or hydroxyl, mostly at the poles, but also at lower latitudes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists working with the Deep Impact spacecraft, which later studied the Comet Tempel 1, also found infrared absorption at the water and hydroxyl wavelengths. More interesting, the amount of absorption -- and thus the quantity of water -- varied with temperature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests the water is being created when protons from the solar wind slam into the lunar surface. The collisions may free oxygen atoms in the minerals and allow them to recombine with protons and electrons to form water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori M. Feaga, a research scientist at the University of Maryland who is a member of the team that analyzed the Deep Impact data, said this process would work only to about one millimeter into the lunar surface. If correct, that would not give future astronauts much to drink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You would have to scrape the area of a baseball field or a football field to get one quart of water,'' she said.</p>
