<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 -- NASA is still aiming for a space shuttle launching in May, but there is so little extra time left in the schedule that the plan could be derailed if a major technical problem arose that needed fixing, NASA managers said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Hale, the space shuttle program manager, said NASA engineers and technicians were facing a ''somewhat aggressive schedule'' in trying to finish preparations to launch the shuttle Discovery during the May 10 to May 23 target window.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Mr. Hale and other managers emphasized that they would not rush the flight just to stay on schedule. But they noted that crucial testing and flight preparations remained to be done with little ''contingency time'' left to absorb unexpected delays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Discovery does fly successfully in May, or during the next available launching period, July 1 to July 19, Mr. Hale said, it remains possible to get three flights off this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has plans to fly the shuttle 17 times before the end of the program in 2010, which requires returning to the steady launching rate disrupted by the loss of the Columbia in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest factors affecting when the Discovery flies is its large external fuel tank, which is to arrive on Wednesday from its manufacturing plant in New Orleans. Michael Leinbach, launching director for the mission, said the modified aluminum tank covered with foam insulation was arriving just in time to complete preparations for a May flight, instead of the normal procedure of arriving months before a launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No part of a tank's normal processing and testing will be cut short, Mr. Leinbach said, but there is no contingency time left in its preparation schedule to prevent a launching delay if a major problem arises.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said a major factor determining when the Discovery could fly is completion of wind tunnel tests to confirm if it is safe to fly the fuel tank with sections of insulating foam removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia was doomed by foam tank debris damaging its heat shield.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most highly promoted missions on NASA's scientific agenda would be postponed indefinitely or perhaps even canceled under the agency's new budget, despite its administrator's vow to Congress six months ago that not ''one thin dime'' would be taken from space science to pay for President Bush's plan to send astronauts to the Moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cuts come to $3 billion over the next five years, even as NASA's overall spending grows by 3.2 percent this year, to $16.8 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the casualties in the budget, released last month, are efforts to look for habitable planets and perhaps life elsewhere in the galaxy, an investigation of the dark energy that seems to be ripping the universe apart, bringing a sample of Mars back to Earth and exploring for life under the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa -- as well as numerous smaller programs and individual research projects that astronomers say are the wellsprings of new science and new scientists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, says NASA needs the money to keep the space shuttle fleet aloft, complete the International Space Station and build a new crew exploration vehicle to replace the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That transition has produced an unexpected shortfall of money, but, Mr. Griffin told the House Science Committee last month, to postpone it would be more damaging than to put off some space science projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're delaying some missions,'' he told the committee, ''but we're not abandoning them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, Mary Cleave, NASA's associate administrator for science, said she took Dr. Griffin at his word that the cuts were a one-time event. ''There was no money available anyplace else,'' Dr. Cleave said. ''We took a hit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programs could still be saved if Congress voted to increase the NASA budget. The agency has powerful allies in both parties, and some have expressed alarm at the proposed cuts, which will be discussed today at a hearing of the House Science Committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at a time when fiscal conservatives are placing intense pressure on the Republican Congressional leadership to rein in government spending, programs that were previously considered sacrosanct are now vulnerable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cuts have alarmed and outraged many scientists, who have long feared that NASA will have to cannibalize its science program to carry out the president's vision of human spaceflight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new cuts, they say, will drive young people from the field, ending American domination of space science and perhaps ceding future discoveries to Europe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line: science at NASA is disappearing -- fast,'' said Donald Lamb, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and chairman of a committee on space science for the Association of American Universities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Science Committee, called the new budget ''bad for space science, worse for earth science,'' adding, ''It basically cuts or de-emphasizes every forward-looking, truly futuristic program of the agency to fund operational and development programs to enable us to do what we are already doing or have done before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the new cuts, NASA's expenditures for space and earth science will grow about 1 percent a year from now to 2011, far less than inflation, even as the Bush administration promotes its effort to bolster American competitiveness by doubling the research budgets at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology over the next 10 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and 56 other senators have introduced a bill that would mandate a 10 percent increase per year in NASA's science budget from now through 2013, among other things.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers and planetary researchers say space science has provided NASA's brightest and most inspirational moments in recent years: the landing on Saturn's moon Titan, the exploits of the Mars rovers and the stream of cosmic postcards from the Hubble Space Telescope.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Dr. Griffin's assurances, they say that delaying space missions can be a death sentence if there is not money to continue developing technology and to keep teams together until the mission is ready to fly again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the case, said Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with the Terrestrial Planet Finder missions, which are intended to produce images of Earth-like planets around other stars. They are the culmination of a line of missions devoted to hunting for planets around other stars and investigating if they are habitable or already harbor life, a goal, planetary scientists point out, that is explicitly endorsed in Mr. Bush's space vision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting ready to fire all the people we've built up,'' said Dr. Beichman, who is the project scientist for the second of the two spacecraft missions, once scheduled for about 2020. Once those scientists have found other jobs, he said, they are not likely to come back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I feel bad about is turning away a generation,'' Dr. Beichman said, explaining that planet-finding has been one of the hottest fields in science lately, attracting, in particular, young scientists into astronomy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were the new kid on the block,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the concern among scientists is for the fate of smaller projects like the low-budget spacecraft called Explorers. Designed to provide relatively cheap and fast access to space, they are usually developed and managed by university groups. Dr. Lamb referred to them as ''the crown jewels in NASA's science program.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, one such mission, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, produced exquisite baby pictures of the Big Bang, while another, the Swift satellite, has helped solve a 30-year-old mystery, linking distant explosions called gamma-ray bursts to the formation of black holes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explorers, Dr. Lamb said, are where graduate students and young professors get their first taste of space science. Until recently, about one mission was launched a year, but under the new plan, there will be none from 2009 to 2012. In a letter to Dr. Cleave last fall, 16 present and former Explorer scientists said, ''Such a lengthy suspension would be a devastating blow to the program and the science community.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One author of the letter, Fiona Harrison, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, said she first learned from a news conference that her own Explorer project, an X-ray satellite observatory called NuStar, was being cancelled after several years of development. Dr. Harrison said that she had been invited to reapply in 2008, but that in the meantime she had to tell her graduate student to find another thesis project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Harrison said she was thinking of leaving the country or perhaps even the field of astrophysics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another move last month, NASA reduced this year's budget for individual research projects by 15 percent, retroactive to last fall, taking money from researchers and their institutions that had already begun work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Cleave, the NASA associate administrator for science, acknowledged that she had been deluged with faxes and e-mail messages from scientists alarmed about these developments. She said the agency would be willing to adjust ''the mix'' in favor of more research and analysis, but added that something would have to give.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have my budget. I don't expect relief,'' she said. ''There's no free lunch here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists said the roots of their plight lay in the Bush administration's refusal to ask Congress for enough money to carry out the Moon-Mars program, announced with fanfare two years ago. But others said they were partly to blame as well for pursuing an overly ambitious agenda in the face of cold realities like the Columbia shuttle disaster and concern about the mounting federal deficit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the James Webb Space Telescope -- the designated successor to the Hubble telescope, designed to see back in time and space within a whisper of the Big Bang -- was ranked first on the astronomers' wish list in an influential National Academy of Sciences survey in 2000. But delays and technical problems have almost doubled its cost, to more than $4.5 billion, and postponed its launching by two years, to 2013. Meanwhile, planned repairs to the Hubble telescope will cost some $300 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Webb and Hubble telescopes, the two highest priorities, are included, said John Mather, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and project scientist for the Webb telescope, ''almost everything else that isn't started had to be stopped.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People assume that when Congress votes for something they send extra money,'' Mr. Mather said. ''They don't.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin and his colleagues, the scientists agree, have tough choices to make, but so far, the space scientists say, the choices have been made in a vacuum, without input from the community most affected, namely them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year NASA dismantled a longstanding network of scientific advisory committees, and while a new network is in the works, it is not yet in place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, ''scientists feel very much left out of this process,'' Dr. Beichman said. ''You could have involved the community and said, 'Here's what we have to do.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''In the end, even scientists can be responsible.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 2 -- Partners in the International Space Station agreed Thursday to launch European and Japanese components earlier than originally planned to ensure they were functioning by 2010, when the orbiting space laboratory is to be fully assembled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heads of the space agencies representing the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada met at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to work on a new plan for completing the $100 billion space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the meeting, Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said the agency planned 16 more flights of the space shuttle to finish the station by the end of the decade. NASA's three shuttles -- Atlantis, Discovery and Endeavour -- are the only spacecraft large enough to carry major station components.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partner nations also agreed to increase to six the number of space station crew members in 2009. The station has been operating with a two-member crew since the Columbia disaster three years ago grounded the shuttle fleet. The number is to return to three with the next flight of the shuttle, as early as May 10.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space shuttle has flown once since the Columbia accident; the fleet was grounded again after the Discovery's mission in July. In its launching, more foam insulation fell from its external fuel tank than expected. The debris was blamed for fatally damaging the Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said the adjusted sequence for building the station shifted priorities, moving up the completion of the station's platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't like that,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''But confronted with a choice between having high confidence to complete the assembly of the station or utilizing it heavily as we built it and possibly not finishing, we chose the former course.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One component dropped from the shuttle manifest is a Russian solar power platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anatolii Perminov, head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, said his country agreed to draw power from the American-built power system through 2015 in place of its own, and proposed plans to stockpile Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to maintain the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said station construction flights could resume as early as August, if it is determined that the shuttle could be used safely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA now plans to launch Europe's Columbus research segment on the seventh construction flight, said Jean-Jacques Dordain, director general of the European Space Agency, moving it up by one flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keiji Tachikawa, president of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, said the first of three components for the large Japanese Experiment Module is now scheduled one flight earlier in 2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though some components will be dropped and a new assembly schedule has been introduced, Mr. Griffin said the completed station would do what it was originally intended to do. ''It's the same space station,'' he said. ''The end product is very much as we envisioned it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington on Thursday, the House Science Committee held a hearing on NASA's intention to hold down spending on space science for four years to pay $3 billion in added space shuttle expenses. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is the committee chairman, and other members of Congress expressed concern over the loss of research projects and the disruption of project teams.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the hearing, some scientists argued that NASA was sacrificing small space projects valuable for training graduate students and advancing science to sustain some big programs. Others said the United States was risking its leadership in space science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think these assessments are wrong,'' Mr. Griffin said when asked about the testimony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA still has a space science program and spends $5 billion a year on it, he said. The notion that the program was collapsing, he added, was an ''almost hysterical'' reaction.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just after lunch on Thursday, a team of scientists, scriptwriters, directors and producers went to work beneath the stars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here comes the asteroid,'' Carter Emmart, one of the directors, shouted as he gazed into the twinkling lights of a nighttime sky over Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's coming in a little too soft,'' Mr. Emmart said to a technical director, tracking the falling asteroid with a red laser dot as he spoke. ''Still too soft. Better. Better. I like it.'' Nearly every day for the past year and a half, Mr. Emmart and his crew have been reviewing and editing portions of a 20-minute space show, ''Cosmic Collisions,'' which opens to the public on March 18 at the Hayden Planetarium. The show uses a digital video system that projects celestial images across the 67-foot-wide hemispheric dome of the planetarium.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is a $3 million production by NASA and the American Museum of Natural History, where Mr. Emmart is the director of astrovisualization at the Rose Center for Earth and Space. Narrated by Robert Redford, the show provides a bold and colorful look at the universe -- with colliding stars, planets and even galaxies -- based on theories and data collected from 30 scientists around the world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There can't be anything wrong, factually or visually, with anything about this presentation,'' said Michael Shara, curator of astrophysics at the museum. ''It has to be consistent with what is being written in the science journals.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the show, in a star-studded view from the Adirondack Mountains -- ''Do you like the height of the horizon?'' a technical director asked Mr. Emmart -- a comet that has roamed frigid space for billions of years approaches Earth. As the comet gains speed, bits of rock from its glowing tail begin to peel off and tumble through Earth's atmosphere, creating a meteor shower above North America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Make that a 1.5,'' a producer yells, prompting technicians to sharpen the image. ''I want to see my house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next images take viewers back four and a half billion years, to the time when a young Earth collides with a Mars-sized planet. The crash creates molten debris that remains in Earth's orbit and is drawn together by gravity. In less than a month, shattered pieces pulled back together by gravity become the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't dressed the Moon yet,'' said Mr. Emmart, explaining the plainness of a yellow circle that looked more like a beach ball in a comic strip than the actual Moon. ''We still need to texturize it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another scientific theory depicted involves a more recent time: 65 million years ago. An asteroid between Mars and Jupiter is pulled out of its orbit and becomes a giant fireball that smashes into Earth at the speed of 40,000 miles an hour, wiping out nearly three-quarters of the life on the planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is called the K-T impact,'' said Anthony Braun, the executive producer of the show. The K-T reference concerns the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary geologic periods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the one that wiped out the dinosaurs,'' Mr. Braun said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planning of ''Cosmic Collisions,'' which received most of its content and financing from NASA, began in 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Braun said his staff had met at the museum with a colloquium of scientists who ''have based their theories on simulations run all over the world that are intended to track how these phenomena would behave.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those scientists was Madhulika Guhathakurta, who is involved in a NASA study of the sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium show ''offers a perspective that most ordinary people in this world have not seen before,'' Dr. Guhathakurta said by telephone from NASA headquarters in Washington. The moving images are accompanied by a soundtrack that Mr. Braun said ''underscores the emotions of each of the computer-simulated scenes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admission to the show is $22 for adults, $16.50 for college students with ID and $13 for children. The planetarium is at Central Park West and 81st Street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the presentation focuses on the past, the show includes a preview of what scientists predict will happen in two billion years: a collision between Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, and its nearest neighbor, Andromeda, that will create one vast new galaxy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The two galaxies,'' Mr. Braun said, ''are drifting toward each other right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay tuned.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's announcement that scientists have seen Yellowstone-like geysers of water vapor and ice particles erupting on a moon of Saturn is yet another stunning achievement for a NASA spacecraft that is exploring the planet and its environs. If confirmed, this discovery will be the first time any water geyser has been detected outside Earth. It immediately raised the possibility that tiny Enceladus, an enchanting snowy white satellite of Saturn, might harbor the conditions for life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cynics may be tempted to read an unstated political message behind the announcement. Perhaps NASA, under fire for cutting research to finance space shuttle repairs and the president's grandiose exploration program, wanted to show us that it was still doing good science. Or perhaps anxious space scientists, fearing that the budget ax might fall on further unmanned probes, wanted to show us how brilliantly their work was proceeding and what a shame it would be to curtail it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intentional or not, they surely did that. This latest discovery only adds to the rich lode of knowledge provided by the Cassini spacecraft and other unmanned missions to bodies in the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists were palpably thrilled, with one recently calling it ''the most exciting scientific detective story that I've ever been involved in.'' The Cassini probe dropped down within 109 miles of the tiny moon's surface last year, where its high-resolution instruments produced images of icy jets and towering plumes emerging from a ''hot spot'' (though frigid by our standards) at the moon's south pole, an area that was expected to be much colder. Their best guess, based on modeling studies, is that the jets are erupting from near-surface pockets of water that is above the freezing point, perhaps heated by underground tides or radioactivity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been much speculation over the possibility of life on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, based on surface features and magnetic readings that suggest a liquid ocean beneath the ice. On Enceladus, though no water has been spotted in liquid form, we now have direct observations of water vapor and ice particles venting from sources close to the surface, and models suggesting pressurized pockets of water just below. The notion that primitive life might be found on a tiny, icy moon in what most people would have considered a hostile environment suggests that the search for extraterrestrial life may have to be conducted more broadly.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Saturn Moon Has Geysers, Hinting Life Is a Possibility  </span>
</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG  </div><div>766 words</div><div>10 March 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With newly discovered signs of liquid water, a moon of Saturn joins the small, highly select group of places in the solar system that could plausibly support life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon, Enceladus, is only 300 miles wide, and usually something that small is nothing more than a frozen chunk of ice and rock. Instead, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has spotted eruptions of icy crystals, which hint at pockets of liquid water near the surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's startling,'' said Carolyn C. Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., leader of the imaging team for Cassini. Nine scientific papers about Enceladus (pronounced en-SELL-ah-dus), appear in today's issue of Science. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see the planetary community clamoring for a future exploratory expedition to land on the south polar terrain of Enceladus,'' said Dr. Porco, lead author of one of the papers. ''We have found an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life requires at least three ingredients -- water, heat and carbon-based molecules -- and Enceladus may possess all three. As Cassini flew through the plumes of vapor and ice crystals rising into space from the eruptions, it also detected simple carbon-based molecules like methane and carbon dioxide, which suggest more complicated carbon molecules may lie on the moon's surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of a crater suggests that the heat is not the result of a meteor's impact. Based on initial observations, some scientists think that this warm region near the south pole may have persisted for billions of years, sufficient time for life to arise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an exciting place,'' said James W. Head III, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University, who was not involved with any of the research reported in today's Science. ''That's what exploration is all about. You go out there. It isn't A. It isn't B. It isn't C. It's D, none of the above.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists pointed to the discovery as an argument for continuing NASA's space science efforts. The agency's proposed budget would cut $3 billion from space science over the next five years to help pay for the completion of the space station and plans to send astronauts back to Earth's Moon. NASA's astrobiology institute, which finances research on the possibility of life elsewhere in the solar system and universe, is to see its budget cut in half.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They must provide sufficient funds for NASA to conduct both human flight and robotic exploration missions,'' Dr. Porco said. ''Right now, the funding is inadequate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini flew by Enceladus three times last year. For the first two flybys, Cassini's observations of Enceladus' equatorial region turned up nothing odd -- except that it seemed to be deflecting Saturn's magnetic fields, implying that Enceladus had a thin atmosphere of charged atoms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA tweaked the trajectory of Cassini's July flyby to pass within about 110 miles of Enceladus' surface. For the first time, the spacecraft got a look at the south pole, which turned out to be smooth compared with the pockmarked northern hemisphere. And it was warm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expectation was that the temperature would be about minus-330 degrees Fahrenheit. It turned out more than 100 degrees warmer. ''Which is fairly dramatic and blew us away when we first saw it,'' said John R. Spencer, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder and a team member working with a Cassini instrument that measures infrared emissions. ''It's a lot of heat to come out of such a tiny object.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Images of the moon also showed towering plumes of ice crystals coming off at high speed from the surface. The jets seem to originate from fissures near the south pole.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco said calculations eliminated the possibility that the particles were produced by warm vapor rising off warm ice at the surface. The best explanation, she said, is that pockets of liquid water exist under high pressure below a few tens of yards of ice. When the ice ruptures, the water shoots out and immediately freezes into ice crystals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we've got geysers,'' Dr. Porco said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small body like Enceladus would be unlikely to hold enough radioactive elements to produce continuing warmth. A more likely explanation is that the gravitational tugging on Enceladus by Saturn and another moon, Dione, squishes Enceladus and that friction creates the heat. Another mystery is why the heat is concentrated around the south pole.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 10 -- The most sophisticated spacecraft ever sent to Mars slipped into orbit on Friday after successfully firing braking rockets and maneuvering itself into position while tense controllers monitored from Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a journey of seven months and 310 million miles, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a large robotic spacecraft crammed with six scientific instruments, performed an intricate ballet of turns and engine firings to complete the crucial step of entering Mars's orbit without careering into space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, mission controllers at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., announced that everything had gone as planned and that the craft was orbiting Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got complete control of a healthy spacecraft,'' a controller said as the room broke into applause.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter is to spend at least two years searching for signs of life on Mars and scouting possible landing spots for future spacecraft and astronauts. It is equipped to send back 10 times as much data as all previous probes combined.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first it had to enter orbit, a goal that had eluded several missions in the past two decades. Three spacecraft are orbiting Mars now: two from the United States and one from Europe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a later news conference, Charles Elachi, the laboratory director, said that with Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter joining this fleet, along with two NASA rovers on the surface, the United States had established a scientific foothold on Mars similar to that on remote Antarctica.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really do have a permanent presence around that planet,'' Dr. Elachi said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reconnaissance Orbiter's main engines ignited on schedule at 4:24 p.m., Eastern time, to begin a 27-minute firing meant to slow the craft enough to find its orbit. ''Burn, baby, burn,'' an engineer exclaimed as telemetry confirmed the start of the rocket firing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firing, 1,800 miles from Mars, reduced the orbiter's speed to about 8,800 miles per hour, from 11,000 m.p.h. Tension mounted 21 minutes into the rocket firing when the spacecraft slipped behind the planet, as planned, and controllers had to wait until the orbiter emerged at 5:16 p.m. to confirm that it had survived and was in orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contact with the orbiter occurred on schedule. ''Oh, look, it's right on the money!'' shouted an engineer. ''Right on the money!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Graf, the project manager, said controllers had had to confirm that the craft had achieved its planned initial orbit, a long ellipse that extends from 250 miles to 28,000 miles above the surface of the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was very relieved,'' Mr. Graf said in a NASA television interview. ''It was picture-perfect.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft began its journey last Aug. 12, when it left Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard an Atlas rocket. The flight path was so precise that controllers were able to cancel some rocket firings that had been planned to correct its trajectory. Howard Eisen, the flight system manager for the mission, said that the two-ton craft had saved 60 pounds of fuel by avoiding the corrections and that this could be used to extend the orbiter's mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the satellite is in orbit around Mars, scientists will have to wait until fall for it to be maneuvered into the proper lower orbit before they can begin their study of the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the orbiter will go through a seven-month period of dipping into and out of the atmosphere to drain off energy and lower itself slowly into a working orbit less than 200 miles above the surface. This technique, called aerobraking, saved more than 1,100 pounds of launching weight, which allowed the spacecraft to be flown on a smaller rocket and saved millions of dollars, Mr. Graf said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the spacecraft begins the series of 500 braking dips into the Mars atmosphere in about three weeks, Mr. Graf said, engineers will take a few images with its cameras. These will be engineering images to check the health of the systems, not the detailed scientific pictures expected when the spacecraft reaches its lower working altitude, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's instruments will stay in hibernation during the months of aerobraking, said Michael Meyer, chief Mars scientist at NASA headquarters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six instruments that will study Mars during the $720 million mission are expected to revolutionize studies of the planet, Dr. Meyer said. These include the most powerful telescopic camera ever sent to another planet; an advanced mineral mapper to identify water-related areas; radar to probe beneath the surface for buried ice and water; and a weather camera that will monitor the planet daily.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will also serve as a communications satellite, relaying signals back to Earth from future craft that land on Mars to explore.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Success''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a seven month journey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter successfully entered orbit around Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday The spacecraft fired its braking rockets just before passing behind the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By October Dragging against Mars's atmosphere, or aerobraking, the spacecraft will move to an orbit 158 to 199 miles above Mars by October.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 13 -- Samples of a comet brought back by the Stardust spacecraft show that at least some of the icy bodies contain a surprising amount of material formed under high heat, scientists reported Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial studies of some of the cometary particles returned by Stardust found materials believed formed near the Sun in the early history of the solar system and somehow ejected into the cold, distant regions where comets form, they said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's sort of a big surprise to see such hot materials so far out in the solar system,'' Thomas Morgan, NASA program scientist for the mission, said in a televised news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first results from the $212 million Stardust project are being presented this week at the National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration's annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in nearby League City, Tex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 100-pound sample container from Stardust returned to Earth on Jan. 15, ending a seven-year mission. The spacecraft flew within 149 miles of the comet Wild 2 near Jupiter on Jan. 2, 2004. It extended a collector filled with a material called aerogel, a low-density silicon material composed of 99.8 percent empty space, to slow and trap particles without significantly damaging them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust also spent part of its long journey collecting the particles from stars. These instellar particles constantly flow through the solar system from far out in space; they are still in storage and have not yet been counted or examined, researchers said at the news conference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington, the mission's principal investigator, said scientists had long believed that comets contained primal material from the edges of the solar system and that the material had never been heated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Stardust captured particles from Wild 2 that contained minerals that form at temperatures of 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interesting thing is we are finding these high-temperature minerals in materials from the coldest place in the solar system,'' Dr. Brownlee said. Studying the chemical composition of the heated particles should determine if they are from the hot formation of the inner solar system 4.6 billion years ago or perhaps from stars farther away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a real exciting mystery story, so stay tuned,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Zolensky, the sample curator and a co-investigator at the Johnson center, said finding crystals formed by heat could support a model of solar system formation in which material coalesced in the center around the early Sun as jets of material also shot outward toward the more distant, colder regions.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 14 -- Additional space shuttle flights will be delayed from May until July, at the earliest, to replace faulty fuel tank sensors, a NASA official said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., the space shuttle program manager, said that replacing questionable sensors in the external fuel tank to be used by the shuttle Discovery would make a launching impossible during the planned target window of May 10 to May 23.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a televised news conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Mr. Hale said the next target dates would be July 1 to July 19.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wish it had worked out differently,'' Mr. Hale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he added, the extra six weeks will ease the hectic preparation schedule that engineers and technicians had been working under and perhaps allow for some optional work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a delayed launching, Mr. Hale said, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration could still mount three shuttle flights this year and resume construction on the International Space Station. ''I remain optimistic,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA plans to fly 17 shuttle missions before retiring the fleet in 2010. That schedule will require a return to the steady launching rate that was disrupted by the loss of the Columbia and its crew on Feb. 1, 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's flight last July, the first since the Columbia disaster, was plagued by a problem with the fuel sensors. If they erroneously register that the tanks contain fuel when they are actually empty, a catastrophic engine shutdown could occur.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that although only one of four major engine cutoff sensors had given questionable readings in tests, all of them would be replaced with updated versions for safety reasons. The older sensors, made in 1996, have platinum wires that appear to come loose with movement, resulting in unpredictable readings, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other work that must be completed before the next flight includes testing recent fuel tank modifications in a wind tunnel. Foam debris caused the fatal damage to the Columbia, and NASA engineers were surprised when sizable chunks fell from the Discovery's tank last July despite corrective measures.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MY daughter, Mira, calls it the big boom, the asteroid impact that spelled the death of the dinosaurs. She's only 3 and still gets scared, or so she says, when it comes up on her favorite Disney dinosaur movie, so I don't think I will be taking her to ''Cosmic Collisions,'' a new show at the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the dinosaur boom, as portrayed here from space, is so scary. But that boom, as the new show makes clear, is only one -- and not the most violent one at that -- of a series of cataclysms that have punctuated and continue to shape the history of the cosmos and the life in it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for example, the show's piece de resistance, in which a small planet sideswipes young Earth, blasting itself and a chunk of Earth into a spray of molten drops shimmering like blobs of mercury. The seats shake, the music screams.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, scientists say, is how the Moon was formed. Within a month, some of the blobs had cooled and congealed into what would become that friendly pale face in the sky. And we have that whack to thank for our seasons; it knocked Earth off kilter and left its rotation axis tilted with respect to the Sun. Not to mention the tides, caused by the gentle gravitational churning of the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cosmic Collisions,'' narrated in a calm voice by Robert Redford, pays homage to a new perspective on cosmic history that belies the serene image of lights wheeling peacefully and predictably, stars evolving nearly imperceptibly. Sometimes things happen quickly, out of the blue, and by chance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years in the making, the new show was produced in collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science; Goto Inc., makers of planetarium projectors in Tokyo; and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanying the press kit for the show was a list of dozens of scientists and laboratories whose data and supercomputer simulations of everything from the evolution of stars in a cluster to Earth's magnetic field have formed the basis for the show. When we see the Sun popping off sparks and rays and arcs of incandescent gas like an angry New Year's Eve ball, we are looking at actual spacecraft images of the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When, at the end, we sail off into deep space, each of the glowing smudges that we sail past corresponds to a real galaxy mapped by astronomers and painstakingly projected on the big dome around us.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realism is palpable. After that Moon-forming collision, which comes early in the 20-minute show, I could not endure the image of a rock intruding upon the sky without feeling an anticipatory jolt of adrenaline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all the events depicted here are so literally earthshaking. Some are even microscopic -- protons colliding inside the Sun produce the thermonuclear energy that makes it shine and makes plants grow on Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are ethereal. Waves of high-speed particles blasted from the Sun clash soundlessly in the near vacuum of the upper atmosphere with the bubblelike protective structure of Earth's magnetic field, creating electrical storms that can interfere with radio transmissions and the wavering curtains of light called auroras that decorate the polar nights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this show were a symphony, the section on the Sun and the aurora would be a flute solo, but most of us will have come for the crescendos, the planet-cleansing life-changing events, the big booms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appearance of something new in the sky, like comets, was often regarded as a bad omen, Mr. Redford says at the beginning, as we watch a dark rock appear in a dark Milky Way-lighted sky over the Adirondacks. It spouts fountains of gas liberated by the Sun's heat and then spits meteorites from its tail as it passes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space, we know, is big and mostly empty. The odds that an asteroid might hit Earth in any given year are only one in a million, Mr. Redford explains. Those odds might sound reassuring until we remember that Earth is 4.5 billion years old.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell that to the dinosaurs, whose reign on Earth was abruptly cut off 65 million years ago. It was then, astronomers and geologists have concluded, that a particularly nasty rock appeared in the sky. An asteroid seven miles in diameter, apparently nudged from its normal orbit between Jupiter and Mars, ploughed into the sea near what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico at 40,000 miles an hour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From space we see a fireball the size of a continent. The entire Earth, we are told, baked at 500 degrees for an hour. Soot blackened the atmosphere for months, blocking light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the species on Earth went extinct, but among the survivors were our own ancestors, who might not have gotten the chance to thrive and take over without the demise of everybody else.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question looms, as we see yet another big rock take aim at Earth (the music swells again), whether we could go the way of the dinosaurs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happily, that need not be the case. Given enough warning, according to new studies, we could nudge an incoming asteroid off its collision course by flying a spacecraft by it and giving it a gravitational tug. This is the opposite of the gravitational slingshot effect used to fling spacecraft to the outer solar system by sending them past planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the new rock passes without the money shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little we can do, however, about a much bigger collision fated to happen billions of years in the future, when the Milky Way galaxy, in which the Sun and its retinue reside, and the Andromeda galaxy, some two million light years away now but closing in, collide and merge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step-by-step computer simulations, in which each second represents 40 million years, show the two spiral galaxies, spinning like jeweled spiders, approach, flow through each other, separate as arms of stars flow gracefully akimbo and then draw together again in a double-yoked embrace, finally merging to become a giant egg-shaped agglomeration billions of years from now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because colliding galaxies are so vast, the stars and planets in them would probably just slide by one another, Mr. Redford tells us. What will collide, he says, is the gas and dust that fills the lanes of each galaxy. As the gas compresses and heats, those collisions will produce countless new stars and planets -- new arenas for whatever life might populate the new enlarged galaxy as it sails on into the universe's golden years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whoever lives there someday will be able to thank this collision for the spark of life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without such collisions, the Milky Way wouldn't exist. And probably, neither would we, Mr. Redford says as we cruise outward through the galaxies, a journey I was sorry to end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning tomorrow, ''Cosmic Collisions'' will be shown at the Hayden Planetarium daily every 30 minutes, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (until 7 p.m. on the first Friday of every month), except at noon and 3 p.m. when the system is maintained. Tickets, which include museum, Rose Center and planetarium admission, are $22; students and 60+, $16.50; 2 to 12, $13; under 2, free; (212) 769-5200.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is reviewing a decision by an agency head to scrap a mission to orbit two asteroids. The mission, the Dawn project, was canceled on March 2, months after a delay because of cost overruns and technical problems. The decision on the review was made after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission, presented new evidence in support of it, the space agency said Wednesday. This is the first time in recent memory that a NASA center has challenged a decision on a canceled mission, said a spokeswoman, Erica Hupp.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., March 17 -- Employees at the Kennedy Space Center returned to work on Friday with orders to be more careful after managers stopped work for two hours on Thursday in the wake of a series of accidents involving all three space shuttles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addressing nearly 15,000 employees over closed-circuit television, James W. Kennedy, the space center's director, warned on Thursday that a major accident could derail NASA's plans to complete the International Space Station and begin exploring the Moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We must stop in their tracks the events that led me to call for this safety stand-down,'' Mr. Kennedy said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, workers failed to lock down the space shuttle Endeavour's nose-wheel landing gear while transferring it between jacks on the floor, causing it to pitch forward. No serious damage was done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, workers put too much pressure in the water-coolant system of the Atlantis, requiring repairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the arm of the Discovery was dented by a platform being used to clean up broken glass. A few days later, an X-ray film container was dropped on the Endeavour, requiring tile repairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, workers repairing the roof of the vehicle assembly building inadvertently started a small fire. The solid rocket boosters and the external tank, which are used to launch the shuttle, were in the building but not directly under the fire. They were unharmed, said Mike Rein, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this week, workers had been under pressure to finish preparations to launch the Discovery on the next mission to the space station in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA officials delayed the mission until at least July so workers could replace sensors on the fuel tank.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 368 pp. Scribner. $26.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LATE in 1986, nine months after the disaster that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed its crew, Mike Mullane made an appointment with Terry McGuire, a psychiatrist consulting with NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mullane, an astronaut of eight years' experience, was far from eager to consult a witch doctor. He was certain, he writes in his memoir, ''Riding Rockets,'' that he would become ''the first astronaut in the history of NASA to voluntarily see a shrink. I would be admitting failure. I would be violating the 'Better dead than look bad' commandment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mullane's superiors, he told McGuire, were driving him nuts. They would not reveal how shuttle crews were chosen or even who chose them. They would not hear suggestions for improving the shuttle's safety and its performance. They would not communicate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGuire lent Mullane a 10-page document written by himself, called ''Leadership as Related to Astronaut Corps.'' ''In the last eight years or so, the dissatisfaction level relative to management style has risen significantly,'' McGuire wrote. The astronaut executive had become an ''autocratic power merchant.'' Bureaucratic tactics like ''inconsistency, ambiguity, silence, evasion . . . all have their place in his studied unpredictability.'' Could such things be? What happened to the Right Stuff?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one respect, Mullane seems to be telling us, there was too much of the Right Stuff in the late 1980's. There were more astronauts -- 100 or so -- than available slots. Most of them had backgrounds like Mullane's: picked military fliers, macho men unacquainted with failure, products of a grueling selection process and endless training. Now they were miserable nothings without crew assignments, and their value for the space program was attenuated by their terror of saying anything that might jeopardize their chances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ah! what joy for Mullane and his like to receive at last a crew assignment, to blast off atop four million pounds of propellant, to perform perfectly for the pleasure of perfection and the preservation of life, all the while being consciously terrified. Counting down toward his second liftoff, in December 1988, he observes, ''My fear was 'off-scale high.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like everyone else, astronauts have parents, and we hear enough about Mullane's, who were supportive and courageous. His wife, Donna, was even more so. Other compulsory subjects, not so well covered when astronauting was young, include vomiting in zero G and the complications of the space toilet, a device so counterintuitive (necessarily) it took Mullane nearly 30 minutes to finish his task.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mullane's astronaut class of 1978 included several names not yet forgotten, including those of Sally Ride and Judy Resnik. Late in the book, glancing back on a life not all that dedicated to exploring social issues, Mullane piously declares: ''By far, the greatest personal change my NASA experience had wrought was in my perception of women. I learned that they are real people with dreams and ambitions and only need the opportunity to prove themselves.'' How about that, friends of equal rights?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman above all attracted Mullane's attention: Resnik, 28 when he met her, a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, a classical pianist and, as he frequently notes, a looker. The Discovery mission of August 1984 was the first flight for both of them, and they had become fast friends during months of training. Readers, of course, know Resnik is going to die on the Challenger in two years, and Mullane is writing with hindsight. All the same, there's a convincing test of his moral animal in an evening alone with her at the astronauts' Cape Canaveral beach house, the only occasion when Resnik, not always a happy woman, opened her soul ''as if I were some harmless confidant.'' He did not squeeze her hand, pat her on the back or otherwise set free his raging hormones, he says. Even an ironclad feminist like Sally Ride should give him a passing grade, I think.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA announced yesterday that it was resurrecting Dawn, a spacecraft that will visit two of the solar system's largest asteroids, less than a month after killing the mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm astonished,'' said Lucy-Ann McFadden, an astronomer at the University of Maryland and a member of the mission's science team. ''I'm excited. I'm ready to go. I was still in denial that we got canceled.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally scheduled to be launched this summer, Dawn will instead blast off in summer 2007. It is to go into orbit around Vesta, the third-largest asteroid, with a diameter of 330 miles, in 2011.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several months of exploration, the spacecraft will blast out of orbit and head to Ceres, the largest of all asteroids, at 600 miles wide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn is part of the space agency's Discovery program of modestly priced missions that go from approval to flight in less than five years. Because of cost overruns and technological difficulties -- instead of traditional rocket fuels, the spacecraft will use an ion engine, firing a stream of charged xenon atoms -- NASA stopped work on the project in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on March 2, after an independent panel found that the mission was running 20 percent over its $373 million budget, NASA killed the mission. About $257 million had already been spent, and about half of the hardware, including the scientific instruments, had been built.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An uproar followed among the project's scientists and managers, who said that problem areas like the fuel tank had been largely overcome and that the orbits of Ceres and Vista would not allow another two-for-one asteroid mission for years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many also saw it as further evidence that NASA was cannibalizing its science missions to pay for the space shuttle and the space station and future plans to send astronauts back to the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is building the Dawn spacecraft, appealed the decision, a new process put in place as part of an agency reorganization by the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin. A group led by Rex D. Geveden, a NASA associate administrator, conducted a review, and in a telephone news conference yesterday, Mr. Geveden said the technical issues had now been resolved to his satisfaction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's work to do,'' Mr. Geveden said, ''but the way forward seems pretty clear.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA now estimates that Dawn will cost $446 million, an increase of $73 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleen Hartman, deputy associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate, said NASA's 2007 budget already took into account a 20 percent increase in Dawn's budget, so the reinstatement would not lead to additional cuts in other missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of favorable alignment of the orbits, the one-year delay in launching will not delay the spacecraft's arrival at the asteroids.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroids are remnants of the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago, pieces of a planet that failed to coalesce between Mars and Jupiter. Studying the largest miniplanets should provide valuable clues to the formation of the Sun and the planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McFadden said recent observations from Earth showed that asteroids were more interesting than once thought. ''They're not just rocks in space,'' she said. ''They're planets.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceres, for example, is rounder than expected, she said, suggesting that it could have an interior structure with different layers of different materials, much like the larger planets. The roundness could be the result of an underground layer of ice that offsets the force of spinning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photographs of Vesta taken by the Hubble Space Telescope show craters and ancient lava flows.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a network puts a television series on hiatus, the actors can go find work on other shows, or in the movies. But what do engineers and space scientists do when NASA puts one of their missions in mothballs?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, after an appeals process, the space agency reinstated Dawn, a mission to explore two of the largest asteroids in the solar system. The decision came five months after NASA halted work on the project in order to investigate cost overruns and technical problems, and less than a month after the agency had decided to cancel it outright.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the on-again, off-again nature of the project hasn't affected the spacecraft itself -- it sits half-built at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., -- it has put many of the lab's workers on a roller coaster ride.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of the people working on Dawn had been assigned to other projects; they will now be moved back to the mission, said D. C. Agle, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the hiatus, the remaining people on the project worked to provide answers to an outside team of reviewers. They also helped to resolve the major technical issues, most of them involving the spacecraft's ion engine, an unconventional design that will push it forward by shooting charged xenon atoms out the back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching date, which managers had already anticipated slipping from June to August, has now slipped a full year, to summer 2007. The mission's cost has risen to $446 million from $373 million -- but those overruns were already tabulated before the project was put in limbo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has not changed is the arrival date at the two asteroids, which orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Because of the fortuitous alignment of the orbits, Dawn will reach its two destinations -- the asteroids Vesta and Ceres -- at the previously scheduled times: Vesta in 2011 and Ceres in 2015.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEVE JONES doesn't have a workshop, exactly, for his miniature space elevator; he is designing it in his dorm room and in four labs scattered across the University of British Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He doesn't have a staff, either; a collection of friends and fellow space enthusiasts volunteer to help. And his budget, in the low five figures, comes mostly from the school activities fund, although Red Bull is donating some energy drinks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he might soon have a chance to join the ranks of the aerospace establishment by getting money from NASA and, in his own way, helping explore the solar system. To get ready, he is spending 60 hours a week on his elevator, which is meant to haul people and gear into orbit without a rocket. He has even put off graduation until the project is done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the chances that a college senior like Mr. Jones would contribute to the NASA space program were remote. Contracts belonged mostly to the Boeings of the world. Tinkerers and students were kept at the far edge of the periphery. But with budgets tightening and the obstacles to human space exploration looking more daunting, NASA is enlisting the expertise of outsiders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the agency is offering 13 contests, which it calls Centennial Challenges, that anyone can enter. The prizes range from $200,000 to more than $5 million, for building gear as diverse as solar sails, lunar excavators and the tiny elevators.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more important than the cash prizes, contestants and administrators say, is the opportunity to sidestep the traditional ways NASA has done business and bring some fresh faces to its ranks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a regular contract, a small group of students like us wouldn't have a chance,'' Mr. Jones said. ''This way, anyone with a good idea can contribute.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones hadn't thought much about contests until the X Prize, the $10 million competition to get private spacecraft into suborbital flight. He was drawn to the idea that entrepreneurs could go into space. So when NASA announced its first Centennial Challenges, Mr. Jones signed up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitors in the Beam Power Challenge -- which includes the elevator component -- had to make a two-foot-tall machine powered by light or microwaves that could crawl up a 200-foot rubber-coated fiber ribbon. Space enthusiasts hope that such a machine -- an elevator, of sorts -- could one day reach 62,000 miles into the sky, delivering people and packages into orbit at a fraction of the cost of today's launchings. The winner would be, in effect, one of the space elevator's earliest drafts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the contest was held last October, none of the eight entrants made it all the way up the ribbon. But Mr. Jones's Snowstar machine traveled farthest, all of 20 feet. The hexagonal array of solar cells, powering two pairs of rollers that shimmied up the ribbon, was judged Most Likely to Win in the 2006 challenge, set for August. The prize has been increased to $250,000 this year, from $50,000. To win, the climbers must make it up the ribbon in less than a minute. So far, 19 teams have signed up, nearly twice as many as in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another well-known high-tech contest, the Darpa Grand Challenge, also had disappointing results when it started in 2004. The all-robot off-road rally, sponsored by the Pentagon's fringe science arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, attracted dozens of competitors. But none of the vehicles made it past the seventh mile of the 150-mile course, largely because of navigation problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, five unmanned cars crossed the finish line. That included robots from leading universities like Stanford and Carnegie Mellon as well as one from the Gray Insurance Company, which had no experience in robotics but whose owners had a personal interest in the competition. The Gray team was one of the last to enter the contest, and it had a major setback when Hurricane Katrina wrecked its New Orleans workshop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, it beat out vehicles built by leading computer-science researchers and backed by defense contractors. It did so well that it has pulled some employees from the insurance side of the business, allowing them to focus on the company's new venture: robotic cars for the military and other entities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never thought I'd work in defense,'' said Paul Trepagnier, a software development manager at Gray. ''I'm a Tom Clancy fan. But that's the extent. I mean, I'm just a programmer in an insurance company.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of NASA's contests also center on robotics. The Telerobotic Construction Challenge, scheduled for August 2007, requires a team of machines to assemble items with minimal human supervision. The idea is to let robots, instead of astronauts, build shelters and machinery on the moon and Mars. In the Regolith Excavation Challenge, set for May 2007, an autonomous machine will have to dig through 24 square meters of simulated moon rock. A separate Regolith Oxygen competition, scheduled for 2008, will be held for robots that can extract oxygen from the stones. Some contests will be held annually; others will be one-time events.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA funds robotics research through conventional contracts too, and it uses Small Business Innovation Research grants to back companies outside the industry's mainstream. But the paperwork involved in the innovation research grants, called S.B.I.R.'s, can be intimidating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have the grant-writing experience to get one of those,'' said Matthew Abrams, one of the competitors. ''The contest seemed like a better deal. And winning something like this can give us the credibility and the contacts to go after S.B.I.R.'s.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competitions offer economic benefits to NASA as well. The contestants, not the space agency, pay for the development. The winner of a big technology prize usually spends three times the purse value, said Carl E. Walz, a former astronaut who works in NASA's exploration systems mission directorate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Typically in R. &amp; D., you pay as you go,'' Mr. Walz said, referring to NASA's outlays for research and development. ''You pay for failures and you pay for successes. Here, you don't pay until someone wins.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials say that some of their contractors are worried that the contests could undermine their work for the space agency. NASA already has companies working on gloves for its space suits; why, then, does it need an Astronaut Glove Challenge? Exactly how good ideas from the competitions will be integrated into the space program isn't entirely clear. ''We're still writing the book on this,'' Mr. Walz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within NASA, enthusiasm for the challenges seems to be growing. The agency announced six more contests in February, including $5 million for the first team that can store or produce rocket fuel in orbit and $2.5 million for the builders of a working solar sail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they win, both Mr. Jones and Mr. Abrams said they hoped to use their prize money to enter some of these more complex challenges, like the lunar lander competition being held by NASA and the X Prize Foundation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregg E. Maryniak, executive vice president of the foundation, said he looked forward to having them enter. ''One of the biggest reasons to do this is to bring in people outside the existing ecosystem,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look, a hundred years ago, a couple of pesky bike mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, bested, in effect, the government-funded player, to become the first to fly,'' he added. ''That's why you put on these things: to attract the bicycle mechanics.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRASILIA, April 6 -- Since late last month, a Brazilian has been orbiting the Earth aboard the International Space Station, fulfilling a longstanding ambition here. But because of the manner in which Brazil's first astronaut was launched into space, national pride has been mixed with pointed criticisms of weaknesses and deficiencies in the country's three-decade-old space program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronaut, Marcos Pontes, a 43-year-old air force colonel, has become a national idol, stealing headlines even from soccer stars like Ronaldinho. He has waved the Brazilian flag, talked with schoolchildren, reporters and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and even found himself lionized in a comic book and toys.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many Brazilian scientists, along with newspaper columnists and editorial writers, have criticized the voyage, which ends early Sunday, as a boondoggle. They argue that the roughly $10.5 million that Brazil paid Russia to launch Colonel Pontes aboard a Soyuz rocket would have been better spent on research here on Earth or invested in rebuilding a space port destroyed in 2003 in a launching pad explosion that killed 21 scientists and technicians.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scientific value of this voyage is almost nil,'' Ennio Candotti, a physicist who is the president of the Brazilian Society for the Progress of Science, complained to reporters. He also described Colonel Pontes as a ''space tourist'' and a ''paying hitchhiker,'' and dismissed the astronaut's eight on-board experiments as ''simply for show.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials, however, say the gains in putting a Brazilian in space are scientific and political. They want to double the budget of the space program, chronically short of funds, to $200 million a year, and view increased public support for the effort and understanding of it as the best ways to persuade the Brazilian Congress to loosen purse strings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea is to give visibility to the program,'' Sergio Gaudenzi, the director of the Brazilian Space Agency, said in an interview here on Thursday. A decade ago, he added, ''China, Brazil and India were all at the same level, but China has surged ahead, and we have been left behind,'' largely because of a lack of sustained investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more money, Mr. Gaudenzi said, Brazil would be able to build four additional launching pads at its equatorial Alcantara base, considered one of the best launching sites in the world because the Earth's rotation is faster there, making it easier and cheaper to put a vehicle into orbit. Brazil also plans to build and launch up to three geostationary communications satellites, and needs to develop its own rocket in order to do so, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The origins of Colonel Pontes's voyage go back to 1997, when Brazil was invited, at NASA's behest, to be one of 16 nations participating in the International Space Station project. In return for manufacturing certain parts for the station, at an estimated cost of $120 million, Brazil would receive the right to send someone into space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States was eager to have Brazil involved because Washington wants to increase scientific exchanges with a country that has excelled in several niches. Brazil is a recognized leader, for example, in the manufacture of medium-size jets, genome mapping and numerous technologies adapted for use in the tropics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brazil informed the consortium in 2001 that it would not be able to meet the first deadline, in part because funds were lacking. It then missed a second deadline, and Colonel Pontes's mission was put on indefinite hold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a visit to Russia late last year, Mr. da Silva, rather than lose the money already invested in Colonel Pontes's training, signed an agreement that made the Brazilian astronaut a paying customer aboard a Russian spacecraft. Russia also agreed to help Brazil develop a liquid fuel rocket, the weak spot in a program that has had some success in building and launching satellites.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the 2003 funeral of the victims of the Alcantara disaster, Mr. da Silva promised that Brazil would still launch its first rocket into space by the time his term ended, at the end of this year. But Mr. Gaudenzi said that target had been abandoned as unrealistic, with 2009 set as the most likely new date for a launching attempt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Pontes's space voyage is officially known as the Centennial Mission, a reference to Brazil's pioneering aviator Alberto Santos Dumont. Brazilians are taught that Santos Dumont, not the Wright Brothers, was the first man to fly, before cheering throngs in Paris in 1906. Colonel Pontes has even been photographed aboard the space station wearing one of Santos Dumont's trademark white Panama hats.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHALLENGER PARK  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Stephen Harrigan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">397 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASIDE from its intermittent disasters, our manned space program would seem to offer contemporary novelists just about the most ho-hum subject matter on the whole gaudy national landscape. Given the uninspiring repetitions of the shuttle, skeptical readers must have greeted Stephen Harrigan's intention of writing a novel about ''the daily lives of astronauts'' by asking if it would be called ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Space Suit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, for one thing, the book's principal astronaut turns out to be a woman, and for another, ''Challenger Park'' turns out to be a fine, absorbing achievement, probably the best science-factual novel about the space-faring worlds of Houston and Cape Canaveral in the nearly half-century since the first astronauts were chosen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set between the catastrophes of Challenger and Columbia, Harrigan's story focuses on the life of Lucy Kincheloe, a conscientious, undemonstrative New Englander who, after years of waiting, has been given a spot on STS-108 (a mission that actually flew in December 2001). As the book opens, the principal drag on her career appears to be her husband, Brian, a bitter veteran of two shuttle missions, one of which carried him up for an extended stay on the rustbucket Soviet space station Mir. There, ''in a now famous diatribe, he unleashed a torrent of pent-up grievances'' to NASA ground controllers. (Students of the real-life American space program may be tempted to read Brian as a refraction of the astronaut Jerry M. Linenger.) After a second screw-up, beset with ''flagging health and fading reputation,'' Brian finds himself headed for part-time college teaching and ''Dine With an Astronaut'' bookings with tourists visiting Florida's space coast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longstanding emotional chill around Lucy's marriage had always been mitigated by the sense of obligation she and Brian felt to each other, to their careers and to their two small children, one of them badly asthmatic. But Brian's taut pride collapses when Lucy gets her big chance. Breaking a promise to her, he impulsively quits the space program and subjects her to a loud scene in front of their colleagues. As Lucy's training progresses, Harrigan nicely dovetails her personal anxieties with the simulation of emergencies in space. (She starts to see her daughter's fears as ''a minor mal that could safely be bypassed for the moment while she dealt with the greater danger of her son's health.'') Even so, at crucial points in the run-up to the launch she's noticeably off balance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucy comes to realize that her chances of remaining with the mission will be saved or doomed by the attraction she and Walt Womack, the training team's leader, are feeling. A 50-ish widower, physically unprepossessing and at least as conscientious as Lucy, Walt poignantly regards himself ''as a kind of falconer, never leaving the earth but reaping satisfaction from the sight of his winged comrade spiraling out of sight, trained by him, charged by him, and in some way carrying his consciousness into the heavens.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In dealing with Walt and Lucy, Harrigan isn't afraid -- many novelists would be -- to explore decency as a character trait. Struggling, in NASA lingo, to keep everything ''nominal,'' his central characters are almost as well behaved as the leads in ''Brief Encounter,'' and when desire does get the better of them, Harrigan fast-forwards past most of the sex, as if he knows it would be a waste of fuel. This is a smart decision, since his talents are better suited to depicting the relationship's emotional intricacies. And the payoff he achieves is subtle and intense; a marvel, really. The two dutiful, abashed and guilty people he's created strike me as the most refreshing literary lovers in a long, overheated time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A veteran journalist for Texas Monthly, Harrigan has snugly Velcroed his plot to the warp and woof of actual NASA routine: the astronauts' prelaunch rituals, the minutiae of mission-patch design and the Bible study groups of Johnson Space Center employees. The density always gathers naturally, not as some data dump from a reporter's notebook. Harrigan does an especially good job with the physical peculiarities of space flight, from the weightless mosquito Lucy notices in front of her visor during liftoff to the way astronauts back on Earth will ''thoughtlessly let go'' of a glass they're holding, expecting it to ''hover in place'' instead of shattering on the floor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author's previous book was a historical novel, ''The Gates of the Alamo,'' and in this new one he allows the shuttle and the space station to experience their own sort of deadly siege. The plot twist that allows him to keep Lucy aloft for months instead of weeks is splendidly executed, in part because Harrigan keeps the thrills and derring-do to a sensible level. He knows that his real psychological business is to keep Lucy wan, anxious and depleted of bone mass -- while back in Houston Walt holds a vigil whose true nature he must disguise from almost everyone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An understated style serves the author well through each planetary turn. This is a stately novel whose emotional precision is matched by the exactitude of its prose. (Harrigan's extended description of Walt's ''negligently bare'' apartment has such a bravura accuracy that it ends up seeming oddly vivid.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Harrigan can't fully rise above is the shuttle's own low-earth orbit. No matter how often he refers to ''voyagers'' or ''outer space'' or what it is to ''leave behind'' the earth, nothing will make that spacecraft do anything but go around in circles. Once launched, his characters remain as governed by gravity as the people waiting for them back in Texas. The mission plan for the fictional STS-108 is described, during the training of its crew, as being ''pretty close to the ideal of a routine flight.'' Its numbing, desired nominality is evident in the usual complement of inane experimental payloads the astronauts carry with them (''an automatic incubator for studying the effects of microgravity on Japanese quail eggs'').  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrigan doesn't completely evade the issue, but he doesn't fully confront it either -- except through the fine irony that, unlike the vehicle it rides, ''Challenger Park'' actually takes you somewhere.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 10 -- A NASA spacecraft will deliberately crash into the Moon in January 2009, in a kind of two-way bank shot that will help scientists search for water that might be lurking in deep, dark craters, the space agency announced Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, the intent is to help find future landing sites for human exploration of the Moon, a goal announced by President Bush in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier lunar missions identified abundances of hydrogen in craters near the south pole that are permanently shielded from sunlight, leading to speculation that the hydrogen was bound with oxygen in the form of water.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If areas on the Moon contain water ice, officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said, they would be prime landing sites for humans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water can be broken apart to produce hydrogen for rocket fuel and oxygen for fuel and breathing, helping astronauts live off the land while exploring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft -- the first to strike the Moon since the Lunar Prospector, in 1999 -- will be part of a previously announced mission in which a larger craft, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, will fly around the Moon to map its surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both craft will be launched on the same rocket on October 2008, but the smaller impact craft will circle the Earth and Moon for 90 days before slamming into the Moon's south pole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is called Lcross (pronounced L-cross), for Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. Its manager, Daniel Andrews of the space agency's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., said the upper stage of the rocket that was to send the orbiter to the Moon would be used as an impact vehicle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the 4,400-pound used rocket slams into a crater at about 5,600 miles per hour, Mr. Andrews said, it should send up a plume of vapor and debris, perhaps 1,000 metric tons of it, rising 30 to 40 miles above the surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 15 minutes later, the trailing ''shepherding spacecraft,'' loaded with infrared cameras and spectroscopes to determine chemical composition, is to fly through the plume, taking and relaying data before itself hitting the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to see the impact,'' Mr. Andrews said, ''and then fly through the plume while looking into the crater and also looking sideways 90 degrees out into space to see the plume material against the darkness.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Horowitz, the associate NASA administrator in charge of the agency's new exploration initiative, said the opportunity for a second payload came because of a recent decision to use a larger rocket to launch the robotic reconnaissance orbiter. The extra payload capacity allowed NASA to consider supplementing the primary mission with something new, he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This gave us a chance to consider additional high-risk, high-payoff science,'' Mr. Horowitz said after a news conference announcing the new mission. ''We got some terrific proposals for using the extra payload and selected one that buys us an early attempt to look at the resources that may exist on the Moon.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, NASA asked its centers to develop proposals that would increase understanding of the Moon without interfering with the timing and primary mission of the orbiter, which is designed to do high-resolution lunar mapping to find potential landing sites. Officials narrowed an initial batch of 19 proposals to four before selecting Ames's polar impact mission, Mr. Horowitz said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expended rocket will probably be aimed at Shackleton crater, a 12-mile-diameter structure near the Moon's southern axis, Mr. Andrews said. The impact should create a crater about one-third the size of a football field and 16 feet deep.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observatories on Earth as well as various spacecraft will also study the impact, officials said, and some amateur astronomers may be able to observe the event with their telescopes, depending upon weather and their location.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will not be NASA's first effort to do geological studies by smashing robotic probes into distant bodies. In 1999, scientists decommissioned the orbiting Lunar Prospector probe by crashing it into the Moon's south pole, but it disappointed them by producing little or no debris because of its shallow impact angle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the Deep Impact project successfully sent a heavy copper impactor into comet Tempel 1 while a flyby craft monitored the resulting blast and ejected matter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The robotic Moon missions are the first steps in NASA's plans to return astronauts to the Moon by 2018 as a steppingstone to going on to Mars. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission, with the new addition of the impactor, is to cost about $600 million, including the launching rocket, said Butler Hine, a NASA Ames lunar robotics official. The added cost of Lcross is capped at $80 million, Mr. Hine said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Making an Impact''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is planning to send a small spacecraft to the Moon in late 2008 to search for water in lunar craters. Both it and the upper stage of the rocket that launched it will crash into the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOOSTER IMPACT   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upper stage of the booster will crash into a crater on the Moon's south pole. A 2.2-million-pound plume of material, possibly containing water, will be kicked up from the lunar surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLUME / SATELLITE IMPACT   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small satellite will pass through the plume, making observations. It will then strike the Moon's surface near the booster, creating a second plume. The material from the plumes can be observed from Earth and other satellites.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diagrams highlight the booster impact as well as the plume and satellite impact.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10th planet turns out to be barely larger than tiny Pluto, a new photograph by the Hubble Space Telescope shows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The object -- still unnamed more than a year after its discovery but tagged with the temporary designation 2003 UB313 and nicknamed Xena by the discoverer -- covered an area only 1.5 pixels wide in the digital image, taken by the space telescope in December. But that was enough to extract the diameter: 1,490 miles, give or take 60 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A previous estimate by a team of German researchers, based on measurements taken from the ground, had put the diameter at 1,860 miles, or 30 percent more than Pluto's 1,422 (as measured by the Hubble telescope).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Hubble observations should pin down the orbit of a moon circling 2003 UB313, enabling calculation of the planet's mass.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new findings, released yesterday by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the Hubble craft, will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report also found that though small, 2003 UB313 is surprisingly bright, reflecting about 86 percent of the light that hits it. Pluto, itself considered bright, reflects about 60 percent of its incoming light, about twice as much as Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis of the Hubble image was led by Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology. ''It's just crazy -- we were shocked how bright it was,'' Dr. Brown said of 2003 UB313, which he discovered in January 2005 while examining images taken in the fall of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the solar system, only Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, is more reflective than 2003 UB313. Astronomers recently discovered that Enceladus has geysers of water shooting from its south pole; the water, turned to ice crystals, gives the surface a sheen of freshly fallen snow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is unlikely to be the explanation for the brightness of 2003 UB313; it is now too far away (nine billion miles from the Sun) and too cold (minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit) for liquid water to exist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Dr. Brown speculates, the bright surface is a result of a highly eccentric orbit that brings 2003 UB313 as close as 3.5 billion miles from the Sun. When it was nearer, 2003 UB313 was warmer and probably had an atmosphere of methane. As it moved away, the air probably froze and fell to the ground, giving 2003 UB313 a layer of ice, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have not decided whether to name 2003 UB313 an official planet or to demote Pluto. In recent years, many astronomers have said Pluto should be regarded just as a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune, too small to be a full-fledged planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2003 UB313 is almost a twin of Pluto in size, the two distant objects could eventually share the same fate of terminology.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 24 -- A string of distracting accidents, safety incidents and tough technical questions have complicated NASA's efforts to get the space shuttle program back on track.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery is to fly again in July, in only the second mission since the Columbia disaster in February 2003. But there are continuing questions about fuel-tank foam, which doomed the Columbia and bedeviled the Discovery's return-to-flight mission last year, and about other parts on the aging shuttle fleet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this winter, there were so many accidents -- a robot arm damaged by a moving work platform, a dropped film canister that damaged heat tiles on the shuttle Endeavour, a small fire in the assembly building -- that last month the director of the Kennedy Space Center stopped all work for two hours and lectured employees on safety.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When work resumed the next day, a worker was killed in a fall from a warehouse roof.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, NASA officials insist the Discovery can lift off on time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is two weeks of schedule margin to preserve the July 1 launch date,'' Administrator Michael D. Griffin said last week. ''We're in pretty good shape.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had planned to fly the Discovery in May, but decided to go for the next available launching period, July 1 to July 19, to complete modifications on the large external fuel tank to reduce the chances that it would shed insulating foam and to replace some sensors inside the tank. The delay also allowed engineers more time to deal with other lingering technical issues, like debris in fuel lines and aging electronics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA needs to get at least two shuttle flights off this year to get back on schedule building the International Space Station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010. Officials hope to send three missions aloft this year and then fly four per year to finish the station with 16 flights, plus one mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, before the deadline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview taped for C-SPAN last week, Dr. Griffin said he was not worried about meeting the goal unless shuttle flights did not resume by late this year. ''If we were to back up to the end of the year, I might start to get concerned,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last shuttle mission was in July, when the Discovery made the first flight since the loss of Columbia and its crew of seven. The Columbia accident was caused by a chunk of insulating foam that fell from the shuttle's giant external fuel tank on liftoff and punched a hole in the left wing -- damage that went unnoticed during the Columbia's 16-day mission, though some NASA engineers warned about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Discovery flew last summer, a much smaller but still hazardous amount of foam still fell from its redesigned tank after liftoff. Subsequently, engineers removed more than 37 pounds of foam from the latest model tank, including a long, ramp-shaped section where the biggest piece of significant debris fell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., the director of the shuttle program, said a major factor in determining when to launch the Discovery was completion of wind-tunnel tests to confirm computer predictions that the fuel tank would still be safe even with sections of insulating foam removed from external fuel lines and electrical connectors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the tests, engineers tried a new design for a smaller foam covering to prevent ice buildup on the tank's mounting brackets, but the new design failed and produced unacceptably large chunks of debris, the agency said. An analysis is under way to determine whether to stay with the original covering or choose a new one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technicians have also removed a manhole at the bottom of the fuel tank and replaced a set of sensors designed to shut off the shuttle's main engines when liquid hydrogen runs low. If a faulty sensor shuts off engines too early, the shuttle might not reach orbit. And if the tank runs out of fuel with the engines running, they would be torn apart and the shuttle could be destroyed. One of the sensors, which also had been troublesome before the previous flight, had shown erratic readings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues included whether to replace some of the shuttle's front windows because of uncertainty about whether they were properly certified to withstand high pressure. Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman, said evidence was found that the windows had been tested properly, but three of the six were replaced for other reasons, like small dents sustained in flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers also had to deal with the issue of ''tin whiskers'' in some computer control boxes. Guide rails that hold circuit boards in the boxes are coated with tin, and hairlike crystalline structures sprouted on some of them, perhaps because of age. Concerned about the potential for short circuits, engineers examined the parts and cleared them for the next flight, Mr. Herring said. But he added that NASA had ordered new guide rails made of a different material to be used in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An additional concern for administrators at the Kennedy base is the string of safety-related incidents since the first of the year. The number of reportable safety incidents in which a person was injured or there was property damage in excess of $25,000 was 23 for the first quarter of this year, said Jessica Rye, a Kennedy Center spokeswoman, compared with 15 for the same period in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 17, an outside contractor doing roofing work tripped and fell from atop a warehouse at the base, later dying from his injuries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some NASA officials blamed part of the mishap problem on shuttle workers who were out of practice doing their jobs because of the low rate of spaceflights lately.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 25 -- The ability to send humans into space after retiring the space shuttle is such a high priority for NASA that some space science must be sacrificed to help pay for it, the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between retiring the shuttle in 2010 and flying a new manned vehicle by four years after that must be narrowed to prevent long-term damage to the space program and national security, Dr. Griffin said before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas and chairwoman of the subcommittee, and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the ranking Democrat, repeated their concerns that the United States could sacrifice its leadership in space if it were to lose its ability to transport humans while other nations continued to do so. Ms. Hutchinson called the ability for America to continue human spaceflight ''a necessity.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin said that the new spaceship to carry humans, the Crew Exploration Vehicle, should be ready by 2014, and that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was looking at ways to speed its development to deliver it a year or two sooner. The main limit to flying the new ship, which could take crews to the International Space Station and later to the moon, is money, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has reallocated money to keep the shuttle flying and finish the space station, while accelerating plans for the new ship, Dr. Griffin said. While all programs at NASA have been affected by budget restrictions, he said, a big share of the money to ready the new ship had to come from reducing the growth of science programs for a few years, in part by halting some new missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists have expressed outrage at the diversion of money, saying it could mean grave harm to space science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Griffin testified Tuesday, ''I believe that fulfilling our commitments on the International Space Station and bringing the Crew Exploration Vehicle online in a timely manner, not later than 2014 and possibly sooner, is a higher priority than these science missions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long gap in American human spaceflight, as happened between the end of the Apollo moon program and the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981, could cause the nation's space industry to wither as its professionals retire or go into other fields, Dr. Griffin said. The United States' leadership, he said, could be lost if nations like Russia and China continued to send astronauts into space while the United States could not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therefore, Dr. Griffin said, delays in launching the new spacecraft ''are strategically more damaging to our nation's space program than delays to these other science missions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration has requested $16.8 billion for NASA's 2007 budget, including $5.3 billion for space science. But the science budget would stay about even for the next four years, reducing financing for science by $3 billion so the money could go to human spaceflight.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY  </div><div>625 words</div><div>29 April 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 28 -- Despite concerns from some of its engineers, NASA has decided to fly the space shuttle Discovery in July without making all potential modifications to its external fuel tank that might reduce damaging foam debris, officials said Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers have removed two large sections of insulating foam from the tank and are still evaluating the effects of that action, the officials said. Work will continue on redesigning or removing all or some of 34 smaller, potentially hazardous foam wedges in the future, but they will fly ''as is'' on the July flight, they said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program, told a televised news conference that the decision to curtail further foam modifications before flying again followed a lively discussion among managers at a program meeting at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. Some engineers argued that the Discovery should not fly until the small foam wedges were modified to reduce their potential for shedding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a strong, concerted opinion from several folks that we should wait until we have a good design on these pieces of foam and then change them before we go flying,'' Mr. Hale said, ''That's not without merit, and we considered it very strongly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But at the end of the day, it is appropriate to make one change at a time with the biggest problem we have, and then work our way to the next situation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing falling fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the loss of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003. Foam insulation falling from the tank during the launching damaged the shuttle's heat shield, causing the craft's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts as the ship returned from a mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Discovery flew last July on the first mission since the Columbia accident, a greatly reduced but still hazardous amount of foam fell from its redesigned tank during launching. Afterward, engineers removed 37 pounds of foam that formed two air ramps, or deflectors, that protected pressurized fuel lines and a tray guiding cables down the tank's side, places from which the biggest pieces of foam fell during the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that removing the ramps was ''the largest aerodynamic change that we have made since the shuttle first flew'' and that its effects needed to be well understood before making more modifications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in a flight test program,'' he said. ''When you make a major change, you should fly that major change, and if you have to make additional changes, then you make them after the flight.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said a major factor determining when to launch the Discovery was completing wind tunnel tests to confirm computer predictions that it was safe to fly the fuel tank with the large foam ramps removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers also want to reduce the shedding potential for 34 foam wedges called ice-frost ramps that keep ice from forming around brackets that connect external fuel lines and electrical connectors to the aluminum fuel tank. Ice formed around these connectors is another form of debris that can damage the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some recent wind tunnel tests, engineers tried a new design for smaller foam ice-frost ramps to cover the tank mounting brackets, but the design produced unacceptably large chunks of debris, agency spokesmen said. The current design fared better, they said, but more tests and analysis needed to be done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA wants to fly the shuttle three times before the end of the year to get back on schedule building the International Space Station before the fleet's retirement in 2010.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency is struggling to mount a vigorous program of exploration and scientific research within a tight budget. So what has Congress been doing to help it along? Not much, judging from revelations that hordes of greedy senators and representatives have siphoned more than half a billion dollars from NASA's budget for the 2006 fiscal year to finance pet projects. It is a terrible diversion of money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is hardly broke. Its appropriation for the 2006 fiscal year was $16.6 billion, an increase from previous years, and Congress seems strongly supportive of an ambitious space program. But that is not enough to pay for returning the shuttle fleet to service, completing the International Space Station and developing a new space vehicle to replace the shuttles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress only made things worse by requiring that NASA spend $568.5 million on 198 special interest items. That was a record for political pork and another sign of how out of control this kind of spending has become since the Republicans took over Congress, waving a flag of fiscal conservatism. A decade ago only six special items costing $74 million were forced into the NASA budget by earmarking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such diversions cause real harm to important NASA programs. In the 2006 fiscal year, NASA had to redirect half of its planned education spending,5 percent of its exploration systems budget and4 percent of its science budget to cover these feckless testimonials to Congressional vanity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science cuts were particularly galling because the projects that were stalled or shrunk had been given priority through a peer-review process, not through the arbitrary intervention of politicians on behalf of their constituents. The meddlesome legislators directed that grants rising into the millions of dollars apiece be awarded to various colleges, museums, space exhibits and technical consortiums in their home districts, in that way reducing the money available to support higher-priority research and NASA's own work force.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can only hope that sanity returns in fashioning the appropriation for the 2007 fiscal year. Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, has urged Congress to reduce its meddling this time around. Better yet, Congress should forgo earmarks completely.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 4 -- NASA has too many tasks and too little money to maintain a vigorous science program, a situation that threatens to erode the nation's leadership in space research and the goal of sending humans to Mars, the National Research Council reported on Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a mismatch between what NASA has been assigned to do and the resources with which it has been provided,'' said Lennard A. Fisk, chairman of the council's Space Studies Board, which wrote the report at the request of Congress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are particularly concerned that the shortfall in funding for science has fallen disproportionately on small missions and on funding for basic research and technology,'' said Mr. Fisk, a space science professor at the University of Michigan and a former NASA associate administrator for science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has come under heavy criticism from scientists since the Bush administration proposed the agency's 2007 budget, which requested $16.8 billion, including $5.3 billion for space science. But while money would be added to continue flying the space shuttle and completing the International Space Station, the science budget would be held about even for the next four years, $3.1 billion less than officials had expected from earlier estimates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said he had no choice but to take money from science and from the new human exploration program to pay to keep the shuttles flying until they were retired in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budgeting jeopardizes the administration's plan for human exploration of the Moon and Mars, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists were upset not only by the loss of long-term financing but also by decisions on what to cut from the science program. NASA decided to delay or cut some missions and to reduce support for certain areas of research, like astrobiology and space station studies on the effects of microgravity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists representing different disciplines complained that they had not been consulted on what programs might be cut or reduced. Responding to this criticism, the agency asked the NASA Advisory Committee, its main outside consulting group, to convene experts from varied fields to recommend priorities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin cautioned, however, that scientists should make suggestions that stay within current budget limitations and should not ask for more money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fisk presented the new report at a meeting of these experts held at the University of Maryland and told them that his committee was particularly concerned that small, lower-cost space missions would be hit particularly hard and that programs to analyze and study data the agency got back from its space missions would be reduced by 15 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller missions and the data analysis that results in scientific papers are crucial to developing technology for larger missions and training graduate students and young scientists to guide future programs, Mr. Fisk said. These are the foundation programs of NASA, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you disproportionately cut there, you disproportionately cut the pipeline,'' it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fisk said that because Congress had requested his group's report, the committee felt free to recommend that lawmakers allocate more money for NASA to correct expected deficiencies in science. It would take only a relatively small amount directed at the most critical areas to carry NASA science through the five years, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would take about 1 percent of NASA's total budget per year, about $160 million, to ameliorate the damage to research and analysis, and the small missions,'' Mr. Fisk said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar amount, he said, could also sustain microgravity research exploring weightlessness and its effects on a ''life support level'' until more money became available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We not just asking Congress for more money,'' he said. ''We're saying, You, Congress, have an agency you have asked to do a lot of things and then you turn around and say it can't have the resources it needs. It's not just NASA's problem.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a public comment period at the NASA meeting, several scientists and engineers asked the agency to reconsider its priorities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., speaking for the American Astronomical Society, pleaded for protecting data analysis from past and current missions that produces research findings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sending spacecraft to other worlds without interpreting the results is tourism, not science,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few months, astronomers have tracked an emerging second red spot on Jupiter, at left, a growing rival about one-half the diameter of the planet's trademark Great Red Spot. The Hubble Space Telescope has now snapped the first detailed pictures of what some observers are calling Red Spot Jr.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said this was the first time scientists had witnessed the birth of one of these huge oval spots, presumably a convective phenomenon like a powerful thunderstorm. The Great Red Spot was already present when observers first looked with telescopes at the planet some 400 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Red Spot Jr. is half the size, the astronomers said it appeared in near-infrared images to be as bright in Jupiter's cloudy atmosphere as its large companion. They suggested that the new storm might rise higher above the main cloud deck than the older spot.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been little noted that the advent of tourist travel in space, not to mention the prospect of stays on the International Space Station and eventually on the Moon (or so NASA promises), presents severe fashion challenges.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zero gravity can really mess up your look. Blood rushes to the head and puffs up the face. Hair floats like seaweed in a current. Luckily for those of us with normal bodies, Star Trek tights never did take off as spacewear.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the shorts and T-shirts favored by modern shuttle astronauts might be comfortable, they are hardly inspired, and unlikely to appeal to those who will be able to afford space tourism.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Help is on the way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the grounds that you have the right to look as stylish in heaven as on earth, the Japanese space agency, JAXA, and Rocketplane Ltd., a space tourism company in Oklahoma, are sponsoring a space fashion contest for clothes that look good in zero gravity. The best designs will appear in a fashion show in Tokyo this fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope 'fashion in space' makes everybody happy,'' said Eri Matsui, a Tokyo fashion designer who presides over the Hyper Space Couture Design Contest. The deadline for submissions in the form of sketches is Aug. 15.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Matsui will work with the contest winner on designs that can be worn on flights by Rocketplane, which -- starting next year -- will take paying passengers to the edge of space for about 15 minutes for $250,000, according to the company.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of European astronomers said yesterday that they had found one of the closest analogues yet to our solar system: three planets and an asteroid belt circling a pale Sun-like star about 42 light-years away in the constellation Puppis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two innermost of the new Puppis planets, each about 10 times the mass of Earth, are probably rocky like our own home, but they circle too tightly about their star to be habitable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third planet, about 18 times the mass of Earth, circles at a distance of about 60 million miles, within the star's so-called habitable zone, where the temperatures would allow the existence of liquid water, the authors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is still too big to be considered Earth-like, and is probably shrouded in hydrogen like Neptune or Uranus, and so is an unlikely environment for life. ''Nevertheless,'' Christophe Lovis, of the University of Geneva and lead author of the group, wrote in an e-mail message, ''this discovery opens the way to the detection of even smaller planets in the near future.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery, to be published today in the journal Nature, continues a pattern of planet hunters leapfrogging one another to make discoveries that are increasingly alluring and suggestive of a life-friendly cosmos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Beichman, a planetary astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., called the Puppis system ''a wonderful planetary system,'' that people will be studying a lot over the next few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most of the 190 or so planets that have been discovered orbiting other stars, the Puppis planets were detected indirectly by the slight to-and-fro motion, or wobble, they induce in their home star, called HD 69830.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first planets discovered in that way were giants, so-called hot Jupiters, hundreds of times the mass of Earth, circling very close to their stars, because proximity and large mass make for lots of wobble. As the measuring techniques have improved, the amount of wobble that can be discerned has shrunk, leading to the discovery of smaller Neptune-class planets, including one last year that was only seven times the mass of Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lovis and his colleagues at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla in Chile, used a 12-foot-diameter telescope equipped with a precise spectrograph to detect small wobbles in the Puppis star. It is the first system to be found in which all the planets are in the Neptune class.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists knew there was something extraordinary about HD 69830, which is about 60 percent as luminous and 90 percent as massive as the Sun. Last year astronomers using the Spitzer Space Telescope reported that the star was surrounded by hot dust, probably the result of bumping and grinding in an asteroid belt 30 times more massive that the one in our solar system and the first one discovered around another Sun-like star.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer simulations by the European group suggest that the outermost planet orbits just outside the asteroid belt, where it would act as a gravitational shepherd to keep the belt in order.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for any prospective inhabitants of the Puppis system, however, the greater mass of the asteroid belt means planets there would be under constant bombardment, said Dr. Beichman, who was part of the Spitzer team. The Puppis system, he said, ''would be a tough place to set up camp.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a commentary accompanying the Nature paper, Prof. David Charbonneau of Harvard said it was a mystery how HD 69830 could have such a massive disk of debris around it while the star itself, according to the observations, has a lower abundance of heavy elements, the stuff of planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charbonneau said the results were encouraging to those who hope to someday find Earth-like planets in habitable zones around other stars. In our solar system, that zone extends roughly from Venus to Mars and our planet induces too little wobble to be seen with present instruments. A smaller star would have a smaller habitable zone, and an Earth-like object there would have a bigger, more visible wobble effect.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the European team's precision could be extended to such low-mass stars, Dr. Charbonneau wrote, ''they might just turn up planets akin to our own.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why don't the pictures taken from orbiting spacecraft, on the Moon, etc., show any stars in the background?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Some such pictures do show stars, and NASA offers a Web link to one that does: eol.jsc.nasa.gov/Images/STS039-342-25.jpg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, however, pictures taken by astronauts are in the nature of snapshots, intended to capture some well-lighted object in the foreground, like Earth or another astronaut.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They employ neither the exposure time nor the film speed that would capture the faint light emitted by stars, which are still distant even from a foothold in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In photographing Earth's curve from a spacecraft, for example, an astronaut would use a relatively slow film as well as a fast shutter speed, to minimize blur from the motion of the spacecraft. The night sky in the background would register as a black expanse. (The same thing happens on Earth unless a photographer uses a long exposure time and very sensitive film.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, if the astronaut planned to capture something like the Aurora Borealis, the film and exposure time would be adjusted for that purpose. In that case, the photo would also include stars, and a slight blur from the long exposure. C. CLAIBORNE RAY  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A future space mission to Titan, Saturn's intriguing moon enveloped in clouds, might deploy a blimp to float around the thick atmosphere and survey the sand dunes and carved valleys below.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the blimp's ability to communicate would be limited. A message would take about an hour and a half to travel more than 800 million miles to Earth, and any response would take another hour and a half to get to Titan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three hours would be a long time to wait if the message were: ''Help! I'm caught in a downdraft. What do I do?'' Or if the blimp were to spot something unusual -- an eruption of an ice volcano -- it might have drifted away before it received the command to take a closer look. The eruption may also have ended by then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, interplanetary robotic explorers have largely been marionettes of mission controllers back on Earth. The controllers sent instructions, and the spacecraft diligently executed them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as missions go farther and become more ambitious, long-distance puppetry becomes less and less practical. If dumb spacecraft will not work, the answer is to make them smarter. Artificial intelligence will increasingly give spacecraft the ability to think for themselves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These technologies are already in operation on specific missions,'' said Steve Chien, a computer scientist who heads the artificial intelligence group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Scientists discussed some of the recent progress last week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAL, the soulful conversationalist at the helm of the spaceship in ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' is not on the drawing board. The work so far has been more along the lines of Roomba, the robotic vacuum cleaner, with autonomy to perform certain specific tasks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chien's group wrote the software that manages the schedule of Earth Observing-1, a satellite that looks for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, wildfires and floods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, known as E.O.-1 for short, takes repeated pictures of the areas it watches, looking for changes that would indicate an eruption or other event. Other satellites or sensors on the ground can also dispatch an alert to E.O.-1, telling it of something it should look at.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Almost immediately, within a matter of hours, the spacecraft is reprogramming itself to image these targets,'' Dr. Chien said, ''and we can get rapid response imagery of breaking science events.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft adds the new observation to its schedule and starts rearranging its other tasks. An observation that had been planned may be canceled or moved. All this occurs without a human in the loop. E.O.-1 just drops a note to the operators about what it has done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When E.O.-1 was launched in 2000, people on the ground did the satellite's planning. The planning software was first tried in 2003, and the satellite now uses it full time. That not only sped up its reaction time, but it also cut its operating cost of $3.6 million a year by more than one-quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar programming can be used for future planetary missions, perhaps for the next visit to Jupiter and its moons, to detect volcanic eruptions on Io or a shift in the fractures on the frozen surface of Europa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's two rovers now on Mars -- the Spirit and the Opportunity -- also possess a measure of thinking ability. As they drive, the rovers use stereo cameras to judge the distance and size of rocks in their paths in order to figure out how to maneuver around obstacles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At every step, it looks at dozens of potential choices,'' said Mark W. Maimone, a member of the team working on the rovers' software. ''It picks the safest path that gets it closer to its goal.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A software upgrade to be sent up to the rovers in a month or so will provide even greater autonomy. Mission controllers will then be able to tell the rovers simply, ''Go to that rock and put your instrument arm down on it.'' Currently, arm deployment takes an extra day, because controllers must first see the rover's final position before issuing the command to lower the arm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another part of the upgrade, adapted from the E.O.-1 software, will enable the rovers to perform a first cut of data, determining what is useful. The rovers have been taking photographs to search for clouds and mini-tornadoes known as dust devils. But through much of the Martian year, clouds and dust devils are rare, so most of the photos show nothing, and beaming them all to Earth is a waste of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're restricted in the number of images you can return,'' said Rebecca Castano of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the new software, the rovers will analyze the photos and send back only those that appear to contain what the scientists are looking for. That will allow wider and more frequent searches. Dr. Castano said tests showed that the software was correct in identifying clouds 93 percent of the time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important, the software rarely failed at finding a cloud when one was there. Rather, the software sometimes saw a cloud when there was none -- a mistake that a scientist on the ground can easily correct.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, these spacecraft seem far from intelligent. E.O.-1's scheduling programs are not that different from the software that Wal-Mart uses to manage inventory, and the rovers' driving autonomy does not give them the ability to recognize unanticipated traps. In April last year, the Opportunity blithely drove into a sand dune, and took five weeks to back out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of the A.I. systems are as smart as a 2-year-old,'' said Cynthia Y. Cheung, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ''We want this system to be able to learn and react to the environment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Cheung is a member of a team led by Steven Curtis designing a more ambitious rover. It does not have wheels. Instead, it looks like a shape-changing jungle gym, with trusses that lengthen and shorten. A simple prototype has been built.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer animations illustrate its possibilities. Across flat terrain, it would roll like tumbleweed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could pull itself, almost catlike, onto rocks or flatten itself and slither through holes. (The animation can be viewed at nytimes.com/science.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To achieve those abilities, the machine would need sensors to observe its surroundings and then use the best mode of locomotion. While some safety rules might be explicitly programmed -- the equivalent of telling a child, ''Do not cross a busy road'' -- the scientists also will put in programming that allows the robot to learn its behavior through trial and error.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'd essentially set up a playground where the robot can perform these simple behaviors,'' said Michael Rilee, another member of the Goddard team. ''It's a lot like what children do when they're very small, and they're just learning to move around.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Curtis said he thought the technology could be ready for a rover to explore the rockier regions of the Moon in a few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much new technology will be built and used is an unanswered question. ''This is a completely different way of doing business,'' Dr. Chien said. ''People are risk averse, for good reasons.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interplanetary space probes cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and a mistake in the programming can lose the craft. An attempt last year to get a small craft named DART, Demonstration of Autonomous Rendezvous Technology, to dock autonomously with another satellite resulted instead in DART's collision with the target.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are also wary about letting a spacecraft throw away information before humans get to sift through it. They often joke about a rover obliviously driving past a dinosaur bone lying on the Martian surface because it had been programmed to recognize only rocks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But autonomy will also allow them to do more at lower cost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some possible missions, like the Titan blimp, ''This sort of thing is going to be key for making the most of the mission,'' said Ralph D. Lorenz, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In an ideal world,'' he added, ''you'd downlink every picture, and scientists would have all of the time in the world to look over them, but you don't have that luxury.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the limited communications with Earth, Dr. Lorenz said the craft might summarize its findings -- that it has been flying over sand dunes, for example -- and send back only a few representative photos instead of images of the entire landscape.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To get the best science, you want to send down only the data with the richest science concentration,'' Dr. Lorenz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for that, Dr. Lorenz is willing to let the spacecraft do the choosing.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 30 -- Russian and American astronauts on the International Space Station ran through a dress rehearsal on Tuesday of the five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk planned for Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will not include a previously planned attempt to whack a golf ball into orbit for the longest drive in history.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a televised news conference on Tuesday from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, NASA officials said everything was ready for the station crew to don Russian Orlan spacesuits and exit the Pirs airlock on the Russian side of the station on the scheduled 65th spacewalk to build and maintain the orbiting laboratory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy manager for the station program, said the venture outside the station was unusual in that part of it would be managed from mission control in Houston while most of it would be orchestrated by the Russian control center near Moscow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the spacewalk, Pavel V. Vinogradov, the Russian station commander, and Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army, the mission flight engineer and NASA science officer, will install a new hydrogen vent valve on the hull of the Zvezda Service Module that is part of the Russian Elektron oxygen-generation system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers will also recover a thruster rocket residue collector and retrieve a contamination-monitoring device and a package of biology experiments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, American controllers are to take control of the excursion as Mr. Vinogradov and Colonel Williams head for the American side of the station, where they are to replace a malfunctioning camera on the Mobile Base System rail car that moves up and down the truss that supports the complex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holly Ridings, spacewalk director for the mission, said Russian and American officials added the camera replacement task to the schedule several weeks ago after the Russians had decided to delay a commercial golf stunt planned by a Canadian company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian officials had cleared Mr. Vinogradov to use golf equipment carried to the station on earlier cargo flights to drive a special ball into orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Element 21 Golf Company in Toronto had paid Russia an unspecified amount for its Golf Shot in Space project, in which a special radio-transmitting ball would be smacked into a three-year orbit of Earth. The company said the promotion was to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Alan B. Shepard Jr.'s famous golf shot on the Moon on the Apollo 14 mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ridings said the Russians did not specify why they delayed the golf stunt, which had raised some early concerns about the swinging club or the ball possibly endangering the station. An American safety review of the proposal is about done, she said, and the venture will probably go ahead, perhaps on a Russian-controlled spacewalk scheduled this fall.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 31 -- Although there is still a risk of dangerous foam debris, NASA officials cleared the space shuttle's external fuel tank on Wednesday for launching of the Discovery in July, after a year on the ground.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle program officials, meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, said enough modifications had been made on the tank since the last shuttle flight to give them confidence that the foam risk was minor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., manager of the shuttle program, said at a news conference that foam debris from different areas on the fuel tank would continue to come off and pose some risk of damaging a shuttle. But he called the risk ''acceptable'' and said, ''We have eliminated the largest hazards.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeating a note often sounded by NASA officials and astronauts, Mr. Hale said the shuttle would always be risky to fly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director at Kennedy, said the Discovery should be ready to launch within a window lasting from July 1 through July 19. In the approach to that window, managers will have unusually long contingency time, almost two weeks, to deal with problems that might arise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach also said the shuttle Atlantis was on schedule to roll out to its launching pad on July 25 in anticipation of a mission beginning Aug. 28 or shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA wants to fly the shuttle three times before the end of the year to get back on schedule building the International Space Station before the shuttle fleet's retirement in 2010. After 2006, officials hope to fly four missions a year before the deadline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reduction in falling fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the loss of the shuttle Columbia, a disaster that was caused by foam insulation that tore from the tank at launching and punched a hole in a heat shield. Superheated gases entered the hole as the ship re-entered the atmosphere from a science mission on Feb. 1, 2003, destroying the Columbia and killing its crew of seven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the accident, NASA spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars redesigning the tank and modifying methods of applying foam insulation to stop shedding. But when the Discovery flew last July, on the first mission since the Columbia, a greatly reduced but hazardous amount of foam fell from its redesigned tank after launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA then grounded the fleet, and tank engineers removed more than 37 pounds of foam that had formed two air ramps, or deflectors, that protected pressurized fuel lines and a tray guiding cables down the side of the tank. Those were the areas from which the biggest pieces of foam fell during the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said Wednesday that there were other tank parts from which engineers would like to remove foam but that officials had decided it was best to fly with only one major modification at a time, to see if the changes worked as expected.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Science Times on Tuesday about an explanation by astronomers of a spectacular eruption in the Milky Way in 2002 misstated the name of the constellation where it took place. It is Monoceros. (V838 Monocerotis is the star that exploded.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Jun 09 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this a picture of a star that just swallowed its own planets? Talk about bad mothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what astronomers have been arguing about for the last three years, ever since Alon Retter and Ariel Marom, then of the University of Sydney in Australia, proposed infanticide as the explanation for a spectacular and unusual outburst in the constellation Monocerotis, just east of Orion in the sky. In January 2002, a star there by the typically ungainly name of V838 Monocerotis erupted, brightening to become 600,000 times as luminous as the Sun and swelling to a billion miles across, about the orbit of Jupiter, to become one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy, as well as one of the coolest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pulse of light traveling outward from the explosion has illuminated shells of dust previously kicked off the star, visible as a movie at nytimes.com/space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Retter's and Dr. Marom's measurements of the star's light output showed that the explosion happened in three stages, reaching a peak in brightness and then declining three times from January to March 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, they said, could be the signature of three Jupiter-size planets going to their doom. As the star began to puff up at the end of its life into a so-called red giant, the story goes, it enveloped its progeny, each of which then dropped deep into the star with a boom, increasing the expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other astronomers have questioned whether the planets would fall far or fast enough to produce the required energy. Noam Soker of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Romuald Tylenda of the Copernicus Astronomical Center in Torun, Poland, argued that a small star falling in would be required to produce the observed energy. Other theories include the merger of two stars, a thermonuclear convulsion on the dense core of a red giant, and the most popular -- none of the above.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Dr. Retter, of Pennsylvania State University, reported new calculations by himself and three colleagues, in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that he said bolstered their controversial notion and a new variant, in which the outburst could have been fueled by one giant planet falling in three stages, like a basketball bouncing down the stairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Personally, I like the three-planets scenario,'' Dr. Retter wrote in an e-mail message, ''but there a few advantages for the single planet model.'' Howard E. Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute, who has taken movies of the Monocerotis eruption with the Hubble Space Telescope, said no theory of the explosion was convincing yet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe it to be one of the major unsolved problems in stellar astrophysics,'' Dr. Bond said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer could be relevant to our own plight. Someday a few billion years from now, the Sun will run out of fuel and also become a red giant, swallowing Mercury and frying the Earth and Venus. DENNIS OVERBYE  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREENBELT, Md., June 12 -- Circling the big glowing ball that hovers in the middle of the room, you feel like a giant alien casually strolling through the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You watch the distant Earth, turning slowly as the white puff that is Hurricane Katrina slides into the Gulf of Mexico. Then the sphere morphs into Mars; the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, moves into view from a far horizon. Then it becomes Jupiter, with its swirling atmospheric bands and turbulent red spot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The display is Science on a Sphere, a pioneering system for presenting planetary portraits gathered from satellites and other spacecraft. Essentially a spherical movie screen of white fiberglass, six feet in diameter, it displays video images from four computer-controlled projectors. Though stationary, it gives the illusion of spinning as the images move, and the nearly invisible wire that holds it up makes it seem to be floating in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a unique way of showing planetary data sets that makes them come alive,'' said Michael Starobin, a senior producer for NASA Television working at the space agency's Goddard Space Flight Center here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., developed the system several years ago as an educational tool for students and the public. But the system is becoming increasingly popular among scientists, who see it as a way of quickly conveying the gist of huge amounts of data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone knew school kids would be impressed, but we've been surprised by the interest of scientists to get their data on the system,'' said Alexander E. MacDonald, the NOAA meteorologist who invented Science on a Sphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are visual animals,'' he went on. ''If people visualize data, they tend to understand it, whether you are talking about 600 million years of continental drift or seeing an entire hurricane season projected in three minutes. This is a lot of information, but people get it if they can see it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science on a Sphere takes flat, two-dimensional images and data taken from spherical objects like planets and moons, and synchronizes and blends them into animated presentations. Most of the almost 100 presentations created so far are silent displays meant to illustrate lectures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Starobin and his group at Goddard are trying to change this approach by producing the first true movie for the system, a 16-minute presentation called ''Footprints.'' (Data scanned by a passing satellite is sometimes called a footprint.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than four months, the group combined remote sensing data and other visuals with graphics, text, computer-generated images, music and narration to depict the dynamic Earth, with guest appearances by the Moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a way to depict the natural world in a new way,'' Mr. Starobin said. ''Using the sphere gives us another way of seeing things.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producing this type of program is not easy, he said, because the sphere distorts things like text and the images of people and common objects. ''We had to be creative, but we developed a set of tools that should make it easier the next time,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presentation is being distributed free to places operating sphere systems, among them science museums and centers in Seattle, Baltimore, St. Paul, Honolulu and San Jose, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. MacDonald said the installation cost about $180,000, which he called a reasonable investment for a major exhibit at a science center. He said his group was working on a next-generation system that would display images in higher resolution. It will also add a fifth projector for the bottom of the globe, which hovers about three feet above the floor and is now largely unseen and unused.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea has come a long way since it came to Dr. MacDonald in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was driving down a road and the thought came to me: Why don't people display things on spheres?'' he said. ''When I got home, I painted a beach ball white and projected pictures on the ball.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked pretty good, and I thought this would be a great way to explain science to people.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have accomplished more than their creators thought possible. Stoic, plodding and reliable, they have muscled across the planet's rugged terrain for more than two years, collecting data about the composition of its rocks and soils in the process.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most dogged workhorses, however, have limitations. In their entire time on the planet, the slow-moving rovers have traversed less than 10 square miles, and their sensors cannot collect data more than a few feet above the ground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To survey areas of the planet that remain unknown, researchers affiliated with the privately financed German Mars Society in Munich are proposing a different kind of explorer: a vehicle inspired more by dirigibles like the Hindenburg than by land-rover predecessors. Projected to reach Mars in 2009, the balloon craft, named Archimedes, would hover much closer to the planet's surface than a satellite, snapping crisp, full-color images similar to those that an Earth photographer might take from a helicopter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an hourlong descent to the ground, the balloon craft would use an array of sensors to take temperature, wind and humidity readings. These data, collected at a variety of altitudes, would provide the raw material scientists need to understand Martian weather patterns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A rover can't tell you the atmospheric density several miles above Mars's surface, and it can't give you an image of the planet's surface taken from a mile up,'' said Bernd Hausler, a project scientist. ''A balloon craft can do both of those things.'' A suite of magnetic sensors could also record gravity fluctuations that provide clues about weight distribution inside the planet, lending insight into its geological makeup.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balloon craft was the brainchild of Hannes Griebel. In 2002, as an advanced engineering student at the Technical University of Munich, Mr. Griebel was looking for a Mars project that would not retread ground that rover missions planned to cover. ''There's so much about Mars we don't know,'' he said. ''I started to think, 'What are the data we haven't been able to get?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A helium-filled balloon craft, he reasoned, could obtain a more comprehensive profile of the planet's surface and atmosphere than any other vehicle. Best of all, the project would be cheap enough -- under $2 million -- that he could pursue it with money from private donors instead of depending on government financing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hausler, head of the Institute for Spaceflight Technology at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Munich, was initially skeptical when Mr. Griebel approached him with the plan. ''Hannes was proposing this crazy idea that we try to put a balloon into Mars's atmosphere,'' he said. Still, seeing the project's potential, he decided to offer Dr. Griebel a faculty position instead of turning him away. ''I told him, 'Let's attack this.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With money from the German Mars Society, whose members -- mostly scientists -- had expressed interest in a balloon project for years, the two were off and running. However, they quickly found themselves up against a host of technical challenges. ''The balloon itself is no problem; we already have weather balloons that ferry you through the stratosphere, which has conditions very similar to Mars's atmosphere,'' Dr. Griebel said. ''Getting it into the atmosphere is the difficult part.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Mr. Griebel envisioned a balloon that would inflate once its launch vehicle had entered the atmosphere. But in Mars's thin carbon dioxide surroundings, ''there isn't much to slow the craft down as it falls, so you need to inflate something big in a very short time,'' he said. Achieving this feat would require a complicated and expensive ground-based control system, so he scrapped the idea in favor of inflating the balloon in deep space and then propelling the buoyant orb into the Martian atmosphere. That option presented its own problems. As a spacecraft reaches the threshold between the vacuum of space and a planet's outer atmosphere, large amounts of friction turn the energy its orbital motion has generated into heat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a little over 170 pounds, the craft would generate less than a quarter of the friction that a space shuttle might, but its filmy surface would still heat up to about 620 degrees Fahrenheit during atmospheric entry. The project team plans to coat the 33-foot-wide balloon with a heat-tolerant polymer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making sure the inflation mechanism would work in a zero-gravity environment also proved daunting. If pockets of gas became trapped in the folded balloon's plastic crevices, they would expand rapidly in the vacuum of space, possibly jamming the delicate mechanical components that position the balloon for inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team scheduled a test flight last spring on the Zero-G Airbus A300 of the French company Novespace. The plane flies in an up-and-down pattern that makes objects in the cabin weightless for seconds at a time. Project scientists deployed the balloon more than 80 times during these weightless moments, and it inflated as expected about 90 percent of the time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the researchers sent the craft into true zero gravity, strapping the balloon and a camera-containing module to a sounding rocket that went more than 60 miles above Earth's surface. Although a few grainy images that cameras transmitted to Earth showed that the balloon inflated properly upon reaching deep space, the remainder of the test was a comedy of errors. The rocket collided with the recently detached camera module, preventing it from acquiring planned high-resolution footage of the craft. Another trial is planned for October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What chance of success does the craft have, given the difficulties of deploying a balloon in space and the lack of financing from conventional space programs? The mission participants have no illusions, describing the project as a high-stakes gamble. ''The deployment system could fail, or the balloon could burst once it's inflated,'' Dr. Griebel said. ''There are all kinds of things that could go wrong.'' In addition, to cut costs the craft will travel to Mars on a satellite owned by the private Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (Amsat), which will be launched from Germany in 2009 aboard an Ariane-5 rocket. If the rocket experiences technical problems, they will be beyond the control of the project team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft also faces competition from better-bankrolled Mars balloon projects, though these programs' projected launch dates are much further in the future. With financing from the Institute for Advanced Concepts at NASA, the Global Aerospace Corporation in Altadena, Calif., is developing a balloon craft for an image-gathering mission that would last up to a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the German craft, which has no steering mechanism -- prevailing winds and its own orbital velocity will speed it along -- Global Aerospace's craft will feature a rudderlike sail to allow for limited maneuverability, said Alexey Pankine, a project scientist at Global Aerospace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pioneer Astronautics in Lakewood, Colo., is working on a balloon-based Mars craft, though no new tests have been reported since a prototype was launched into the stratosphere six years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Zubrin, an aerospace engineer and the author of ''The Case for Mars,'' thinks the German craft has the best immediate promise of the Mars balloon projects in the works. Dr. Zubrin sees the craft as a trailblazer for more elaborate, longer-lived future balloons, much as NASA's 1997 Sojourner rover paved the way for Spirit and Opportunity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scientists involved are taking this extremely seriously; they're putting the craft through the kind of rigorous testing that's needed,'' he said. If the German team succeeds, he added, it will mark a cultural as well as a scientific milestone, illustrating the extent to which private citizens can chart the course of space exploration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to providing unique image and climate data, Dr. Pankine thinks the German craft could aid the cause of astrobiology. ''The magnetic field readings they're taking will tell us more about Mars's geological history, and the more we know about what originally shaped the surface, the more we can figure out whether conditions existed to create life,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zubrin said the greatest potential of the German craft lay not in turning up unexpected findings, but in adding detail and breadth to public conceptions of Mars. ''Right now, the image of Mars most people have is either a small dot in the sky or an expanse of terrain a few miles wide,'' he said. ''With this mission, we'll get the big picture. We'll finally start to see Mars as an entire world in itself.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 17 -- After what they called a ''spirited discussion,'' NASA officials decided Saturday to launch the space shuttle Discovery as planned on July 1. It will be only the second flight since the Columbia tragedy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concluding a two-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida that Michael D. Griffin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said involved ''intensive and spirited exchange'' over safety issues, shuttle authorities gave a go-ahead to the flight despite the reservations of two senior officials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin told a televised news conference from Kennedy that he approved the 13-day flight because he did not feel it presented an undue risk to the seven-member crew, even though issues remained about debris from the shuttle's external fuel tank that could damage the vehicle during launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said Bryan O'Conner, the agency's lead safety official, and Christopher Scolese, its chief engineer, eventually signed off on the flight plans, but noted their objections about proceeding without fully resolving the debris issue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said NASA gets lots of advice and seriously considers it all. However, he said, when there is not unanimous agreement, he has to make a decision, state his rationale for it, and proceed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were very different viewpoints on the issue of whether we were ready to fly or not,'' he said. ''I can't possibly accept every recommendation given to me by every member of my staff, especially when they all don't agree.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern centers on pieces of insulating foam that cover 34 brackets on the tank that secure pipes and wiring. These so-called ice-frost ramps prevent the buildup of ice, another form of hazardous debris that could fall off during launching and damage the shuttle's heat shield. The ramps are being redesigned to reduce their size and hazard potential, but any changes cannot be adapted until at least next spring, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said the largest falling foam hazards had been eliminated from the fuel tank, and although the ice-frost ramps remained a high-risk problem, flight experience suggested they could remain unchanged for a few flights without significantly increasing their chances of causing crucial damage to a shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the loss of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003. Foam insulation falling from the tank during launching damaged Columbia's heat shield, causing the destruction of the craft and the deaths of seven astronauts as the ship tried to return through the atmosphere from a mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars redesigning the tank to reduce foam shedding. However, when Discovery flew last July on the first mission since Columbia, a greatly reduced but hazardous amount of foam still fell from its redesigned tank, including a large, potentially damaging piece.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA grounded the fleet, and tank engineers removed more than 37 pounds of foam that formed two air deflectors that protected pressurized fuel lines and cables down the side of the tank, places from which the biggest pieces of foam fell during the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said he wanted shuttles flying soon to get in 16 or 17 missions to finish construction of the International Space Station and service the Hubble Space Telescope before the orbiters are retired in 2010. Delays, he said, will add pressure to rush flights to stay on schedule, which increases safety risks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a shuttle is critically damaged during launching, Mr. Griffin said, the crew could make it to the space station to await rescue by another shuttle or a Russian spacecraft. Such an accident would not unduly threaten crew safety, he said, but it probably would end the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would be moving to shut the program down,'' Mr. Griffin said of the loss of another shuttle. ''I think, at that point, we're done.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 21 -- Two NASA officials who voted to delay the coming launching of the space shuttle Discovery said Wednesday that their reservations concerned potential damage to the spacecraft, not fears for the safety of the crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan O'Connor, NASA's lead safety official, and Christopher Scolese, its chief engineer, voted ''no go'' on Saturday when agency officials meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida cleared Discovery for a planned July 1 liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other officials acknowledged that it was somewhat unusual to certify a shuttle to fly without complete concurrence by the top managers. But they said that everyone's concerns had been vetted in an intensive, nonconfrontational exchange during two days of meetings and that a decision was made to go ahead with the flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to inquiries from reporters, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Scolese on Wednesday answered questions about their dissenting opinions in a telephone news conference and both said their concerns were not about the safety of Discovery's seven-member crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two officials said they were concerned that the insulating foam that covers 34 metal brackets on the shuttle's external fuel tank might dislodge during the launching and damage the spacecraft's protective heat shield beyond repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though such damage would not endanger the crew, which could stay in a ''safe haven'' aboard the International Space Station until rescued by another shuttle, the officials said they were concerned about losing an irreplaceable shuttle like Discovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My no-go was based on loss of vehicle risk,'' Mr. O'Connor said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials said they signed off on proceeding with the flight, only the second since the loss of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003, but wanted to note their objections about proceeding without fully resolving the foam debris issue. Engineers have redesigned the fuel tank and removed most sources of large pieces of potentially damaging debris, leaving remaining foam over the brackets as a leading source of damage, shuttle officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the Columbia accident. Foam insulation falling from the tank during the launching damaged the shuttle's heat shield, causing the destruction of the craft and the death of the crew when the shuttle tried to return through the atmosphere from a mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Discovery flew last July on the first mission since Columbia, a greatly reduced but still hazardous amount of foam fell from its tank, resulting in further foam reduction since then.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two small moons of Pluto, formerly known as S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2, now have the names Hydra and Nix. In May 2005, astronomers discovered the two moons, each probably less than 100 miles wide, using the Hubble Space Telescope. In Greek mythology, Pluto is the god of the underworld, so the discoverers proposed as names for the moons Hydra, the serpent with nine heads, and Nyx, the goddess of darkness. The International Astronomical Union in Paris, which governs astronomical nomenclature, changed Nyx to Nix because an asteroid had already been named Nyx. KENNETH CHANG (NYT)  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is NASA slipping back into the same old bad habits that yielded two disastrous space shuttle accidents in the past? That question is inevitably raised by the agency's troubling rationale for launching the shuttle Discovery in early July despite objections from the agency's top safety officer and chief engineer, both of whom urged a delay to make further design changes lest the vehicle be lost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to proceed with the launch anyway -- made by Michael Griffin, the administrator of NASA -- was a gutsy call. It even seems reasonable, if you accept the constraints he was operating under. But if you believe, as we do, that the benefits to be gained from further shuttle flights are minimal, this looks like an unnecessary risk to the spacecraft and to the astronauts who will be riding in it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no one is saying so publicly, this decision was primarily driven by diplomatic and budgetary considerations. The Bush administration, which has no qualms about flouting allies in other areas, has decided that it must honor commitments to our 15 international partners to complete the space station that is now circling half-finished overhead. Some 16 more shuttle flights will be needed to carry large components that cannot be lifted any other way. The administration has also decided to retire the aging shuttles for good in 2010, primarily to free up substantial sums to pursue the president's grandiose but underfinanced plan to explore the Moon and Mars in coming decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given those two imperatives, Mr. Griffin concluded that it would be better to take a little risk now and send the long-grounded shuttles back into space than to delay even longer and then try to cram all 16 flights into future years. This sounds suspiciously as though Mr. Griffin has fallen into the old trap of sacrificing safety to meet his launching schedule -- precisely the kind of trade-off that has been blamed for the loss of two shuttles in the past. Mr. Griffin contends that launching now will reduce future schedule pressures, but that seems a lame rationale for a mission that will be the first ever classified as an ''unacceptable risk'' by the agency's engineering analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The red flag involves insulating foam. When 25 top managers were polled at a recent flight readiness review, NASA's lead safety officer and its chief engineer both recommended against flying until design changes were made to reduce the risk that foam would break off from the external fuel tank and hit the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, the shuttle Columbia was destroyed by just such an event. Ever since, NASA has been struggling, with only limited success, to eliminate the foam-shedding problem. It removed the area of foam on the fuel tank that had felled the Columbia, but on a gingerly flight by Discovery last summer a dangerous chunk broke loose from another area. Much additional foam was removed, but engineers remain concerned about foam that covers the so-called ice-frost ramps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's crew members -- some of whom have been waiting a decade for their chance to fly -- voiced unanimous support for launching now. And in the end the two dissenting NASA experts acquiesced in the decision to launch because there are ways to rescue the astronauts from danger. Even if debris punches a hole in the shuttle's skin, it should be possible to detect any damage to the heat shield before the astronauts try to return to earth. That would allow time to try a rudimentary repair in orbit or to transfer the astronauts to the space station to await rescue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials gloss over how risky a rescue attempt would be. Although another shuttle will be ready to retrieve the astronauts, it would be vulnerable to the same foam shedding as the Discovery. Russian spacecraft, though sturdy, can accommodate fewer passengers, stretching out any rescue attempt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin and his top managers dispute the idea that an accident is ''probable'' -- one called the likelihood ''extremely remote'' -- mostly because of the shuttle's past history. Although lots of small pieces of foam have fallen off the ice-frost ramps in previous flights, they say, none have caused significant damage. That sounds eerily like NASA's attitude back in the 1980's when it reasoned that leaks in the O-ring seals of the shuttle's booster rockets were tolerable because they had never damaged a shuttle -- until, of course, they destroyed the Challenger during ascent in 1986.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are safer options that could be pursued if higher officials in the administration were willing. The 2010 date for retiring the shuttles could be extended slightly, allowing time to resolve the foam problem and then get in all 16 flights. Or 2010 could be held firm and the number of shuttle flights reduced, yielding a smaller space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any delays inevitably increase the chances that the shuttle program will be terminated before the space station is completed. That would not be a national disaster, in our judgment. The aging shuttles are a diminishing asset, required primarily to finish the space station, which is itself of only marginal scientific value. That makes it doubly sad that Mr. Griffin feels constrained to launch a flawed vehicle to complete a job that is barely worth doing.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With dogged determination, NASA will try resuming regular space shuttle missions this week, hoping that the venerable spacecraft will weather aging components and falling debris long enough to finish construction of the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched as early as Saturday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on just the second flight since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven. Officials hope to test the modifications and new procedures instituted after the disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration flew its first test flight after the disaster almost a year ago, and the second was to follow just weeks later. But a problem with shedding foam persisted, even after the space agency spent more than a year and hundreds of millions of dollars to correct it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia disintegrated while returning from a research mission on Feb. 1, 2003, after being critically damaged at liftoff when a piece of foam weighing 1.67 pounds broke from its external fuel tank and struck its left wing. That opened a crack that admitted superheated gases when the craft re-entered earth's atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the highly modified Discovery flew last year, much less foam debris fell. But the tank still shed several unacceptably large pieces, weighing up to a pound, that could have done severe damage. NASA grounded the fleet and removed 35 more pounds of foam from critical areas. This month, mission managers pronounced the Discovery ready to fly again, even though some engineers argued that more needed to be done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defending the decision, NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said that falling foam might pose a danger to the shuttle but not to the crew, because the astronauts could find a haven, if necessary, on the orbiting space station; another shuttle could then be sent to retrieve them. (Mr. Griffin did add, however, that another serious accident could end the shuttle program.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle fleet is scheduled to fly 16 more missions to complete work on the half-finished space station and possibly to service the Hubble Space Telescope. The three remaining shuttles -- Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour -- are scheduled to be retired in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're going to fly, we need to accept some programmatic risks -- not crew risks -- and get on with it,'' Dr. Griffin said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's crew members, experienced astronauts and rookies alike, say they are eager to get under way. ''The crew is ready, we're ready,'' said the mission commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, who has flown three previous missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goals of the 12-day flight are to test the post-Columbia modifications and procedures, perform maintenance on the space station and deliver critical supplies, and deliver a new crew member to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the Columbia disaster, the space station had three astronauts. Without regular shuttle visits, the station had provisions for only two. But now Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut with the European Space Agency, will join Pavel Vinogradov of Russia and Jeffrey Williams of the United States, who are about halfway through their 180-day stay. Station managers said the additional crewman would allow the astronauts to move beyond maintaining the research outpost to performing more science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To inspect for possible in-flight damage to the Discovery, NASA has mounted additional cameras on the shuttle since the last mission; every aspect of liftoff will be examined for possible problems. Video cameras at the top of each rocket booster look down on the fuel tank, and new ones on the bottom look up. One on the tank looks at the shuttle's belly, and a digital camera will take photographs of the fuel tank after it drops away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expanded observations of the flight will also take place on the ground. More than 100 cameras and radar devices at 25 widely scattered sites will make high-definition images of the shuttle from numerous angles. As with the previous launching, this one will be done in daylight so the fuel tank can be easily photographed as it drops into the ocean thousands of miles from Cape Canaveral.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspection will continue as the shuttle heads to the space station. Astronauts will extend a 50-foot, Canadian-built robot arm that has a 50-foot boom with a camera and a laser imager. The crew will spend seven hours moving the boom along critical parts of the shuttle's heat-protection system looking for potential problems areas, and will relay the data to the ground for closer examination.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon approaching the space station, Colonel Lindsey will stop the Discovery about 600 feet away and execute a tricky maneuver that should take about eight minutes. He will rotate the 100-ton orbiter nose-up in a full circle, allowing the station crew to take detailed photographs of the shuttle. Once done, Colonel Lindsey and the Discovery's pilot, Mark E. Kelly, a Navy commander who flew on one earlier mission, will dock the shuttle to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two spacecraft will be attached for about a week, during which time the Discovery will unload tons of supplies and new equipment carried in an Italian-made module called Leonardo. The cargo transfer will be supervised by Stephanie D. Wilson, a first-time astronaut, who will also use the station's robot arm to move Leonardo from the shuttle's cargo bay to the station and back again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two spacewalks are planned during the mission, with a third possible if controllers determine that the Discovery has enough power and oxygen for an extra day at the station. Piers J. Sellers, a veteran of a previous flight and three spacewalks, and Michael E. Fossum, on his first mission, will venture outside to repair a mini-railcar system that transports equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair will also attach a work platform to the end of the shuttle's robot arm and extension boom to see if it can serve as a stable platform that would allow astronauts to reach previously inaccessible parts of the shuttle to repair damage. The Discovery's flight engineer, Cmdr. Lisa M. Nowak of the Navy, who is on her first mission, will operate the robot arm during the spacewalks. If a third walk is possible, the astronauts will tests methods that could be used to repair damage to the heat shields on the shuttle's wing and nose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mission is successful, N. Wayne Hale Jr., the chief of the shuttle program, said NASA could launch the Atlantis as early as Aug. 28 to resume construction of the space station.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 29 -- NASA officials revealed a new plan on Thursday that might allow a last-ditch effort to save a damaged space shuttle by guiding it back to Earth without astronauts aboard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system, which could be used if astronauts were forced to abandon the shuttle and take refuge in the International Space Station, makes use of a 28-foot-long braided cable, weighing about five pounds, that can be attached to various control boxes on the shuttle. It would allow flight controllers on the ground to activate systems that previously had to be switched on by members of the shuttle crew, including power units, landing gear and drag chutes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, the deputy manager of the space shuttle program, described the automatic landing system at a news briefing in preparation for the launching of the shuttle Discovery as early as Saturday. The flight will be only the second since the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven astronauts in 2003, because a piece of falling foam put a hole in the left wing during ascent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA spent two years redesigning the external fuel tank and developed potential repair methods. But in the flight of the shuttle Discovery last year, several pieces of foam fell from the tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly announced cable system could offer an alternative to ditching a craft worth at least $2 billion. If the craft had a chance of successful re-entry but officials felt that the risk to crew might be unacceptably high, the cable could be tried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing might be tried at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California so the approach to Earth would occur over water.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan was developed over the past year, said Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman. In the past NASA officials have argued that it would be impossible to land the shuttle without astronauts. Before the cable was developed, Mr. Herring said, the ability to feed landing instructions to the computers was there, but ''the ability to land safely was not.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A balky camera on the Hubble Space Telescope has been restarted and will begin taking pictures again tomorrow evening, NASA officials said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Advanced Camera for Surveys, which consists of three electronic cameras that can detect light from ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths, malfunctioned June 19.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers quickly suspected a problem with the power supply, but spent a week and a half investigating to be certain. Other instruments on the telescope continued operating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, engineers decided to switch the camera to a backup electronics system. That switch was performed Thursday evening, and the camera was turned back on yesterday morning. Tests showed that it was operating properly. "Everything worked out great,'' said Susan Hendrix, a NASA spokeswoman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advanced camera, one of the telescope's main instruments, was installed by astronauts during a 2002 space shuttle mission. It offers sharper images and a wider angle of view than earlier instruments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observations that the camera was to have made in the past week and a half will be rescheduled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restarting the camera also gave the engineers the opportunity to recalibrate it to operate at lower temperatures, reducing the amount of noise in images.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 30 -- The space shuttle Discovery and its seven astronauts are to roar into orbit on Saturday afternoon on what NASA managers called ''a rather pedestrian mission'' that nevertheless has a great deal riding on it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liftoff is scheduled for 3:49, when Earth's rotation will put the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center here in the orbital plane of the International Space Station, the shuttle's destination.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's biggest concern is the weather, with a 60 percent probability of thunderstorms that would force a postponement of at least a day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day mission is mainly dedicated mainly to carrying food, water, spare parts, oxygen and other supplies to the International Space Station, along with a new crew member, Thomas Reiter of Germany, who will be the first astronaut from the European Space Agency to serve on the orbiting laboratory for a long term.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But far more important to the future of the space program is the issue of flaws that doomed two previous missions, those of the Challenger in 1986 and the Columbia in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is only the second flight since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven, caused by a 1.67-pound piece of foam that fell from the shuttle's giant external fuel tank during ascent and punched a lethal hole in its left wing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA spent two years redesigning the tank and developed potential repair methods. But shortly after the Discovery's liftoff in its return-to-flight mission a year ago, several smaller but still hazardous pieces of foam fell from the tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew S. W. Thomas, an astronaut aboard that flight, recalled in an interview on Friday that as it circled the Earth, ''there were people saying, 'We're the last shuttle flight.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, Saturday's launching will be closely monitored by batteries of cameras both at the space center and at other locations along the flight path.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also an escape plan if damage is detected during the flight. The shuttle would dock at the orbiting space station and the astronauts would move into it for weeks or months until a rescue mission by a second shuttle could be launched.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combined crew of nine would have to live under relatively cramped conditions in 1,800 square feet of habitable space. (The average new American home is more than 2,400 square feet.) Michael T. Suffredini, the manager for the International Space Station, said that under this ''safe haven'' plan, the space station was well stocked with the food, water and oxygen that the combined crew would need, with ''quite a bit of margin.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA would then be faced with the unhappy prospect of flying another shuttle with the same design flaws that caused the damage on the Discovery flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of the concerns about falling foam, however, many officials and astronauts say the biggest worries are the oldest ones, most prominently the shuttle's main engines and solid rocket boosters during the crucial, bone-rattling eight and a half minutes of flight before the main engines cut off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flying the shuttle is not without risk for many reasons way beyond foam,'' NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said Friday at a preflight news conference, ''and in fact, I worry that we spend so much time worrying about foam that we won't worry about other things that could get us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three main engines burn more than 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen that is pumped in from the external tank. And while they can at least be turned off if something goes wrong, the two solid rocket boosters flanking the huge fuel tank burn until their propellant is used up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial ascent is ''a controlled explosion,'' said Mike Mullane, a former astronaut, and ''the most terrifying part of the flight.'' By comparison, foam damage is a problem that affects re-entry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I was aboard that rocket,'' he added, ''I wouldn't be thinking at all about re-entry.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A storm on Saturday afternoon, in the 10-minute time window when the launching pad is in alignment with the space station, would force a postponement because of the potential for other kinds of damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the enormous speeds of launching, raindrops become bullets that can damage the shuttle's skin. NASA will not launch if there is rain on the launching pad or in the flight path, if lightning has been detected within 11.5 miles of the pad, or if winds are more than about 34 miles per hour. High anvil-shaped thunderclouds that are likely to produce lightning must be at least 20 miles away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If weather or a last-minute technical problem causes the space agency to put off the flight on Saturday, a second attempt will take place on Sunday. If the weather proves uncooperative on Sunday -- and right now the weather for Sunday looks much like the weather for Saturday, with the same 60 percent chance of a scrub -- then NASA will probably stand down until Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If problems persist, or if a new issue emerges that requires more study and repair, the current launching window will last until July 19, with the next opportunities coming between Aug. 28 and Sept. 14.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In NASA's preflight review this month, some leading engineers argued against launching the current mission until areas of the fuel tank that still shed small amounts of foam could be redesigned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Griffin, the head of the space agency, overruled the engineers, saying he did not agree with their assertion that a foam incident was ''probable'' over the life of the program and that the result would be ''catastrophic.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that the risk was to the vehicle and not the crew, who could wait aboard the space station for rescue if the shuttle was damaged during ascent, and that he wanted to leave time to complete the 17 missions planned before President Bush's deadline for ending the shuttle program in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Mr. Griffin defended that decision, contrasting the open discussion with the process that led up to the Columbia disaster, in which managers were found to have squelched dissent. This month's preflight review was a healthy exchange of ideas and decision-making about difficult issues, he said, adding, ''What you're seeing is a good process.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think sometimes people mistake the desire to hear all of the opinions with the ability to agree with all of the opinions,'' he said. ''Agreement is not offered. What is offered is a willingness and a desire to hear, and an obligation to speak.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Columbia disaster, NASA was widely accused of letting scheduling pressures override safety concerns. But Mr. Griffin said schedules could not be ignored.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This may be politically incorrect,'' he said, ''but there are no activities that humans undertake that don't have a schedule associated with them. It matters if you finish a job this year or in the next decade.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying to work in 17 flights before 2010, he said, was ''a schedule we can meet, but we need to get on with things.'' And he added:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do not think -- I absolutely do not think and do not accept -- that we are being unduly influenced by schedule pressure. But we pay attention to schedule because time is money, and that matters.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery is to be launched this afternoon on the first mission since last July, when pieces of foam fell from the external fuel tank during ascent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2005 mission, the PAL ramps -- intended to protect cables and lines near the solid rocket boosters -- were removed. That made it necessary to add extensions to ice/frost ramps, which protect the brackets holding the cables and lines to the tank.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a few evenings this coming week, people who look up at the right time should be able to glimpse a high-speed space chase: the shuttle Discovery pursuing and finally capturing the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station, an orbiting laboratory whose first section was launched in 1998, will flit across the night sky over much of the United States several times during the next week. Barring clouds, its glint of reflected sunshine will be easy to spot, even with the naked eye.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight, the station will be visible over New York City for about two minutes, appearing in the northern sky about 10:06 p.m. and moving to the east. If the shuttle lifts off this afternoon as scheduled, it will follow roughly the same trajectory at 10:13 p.m.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday the station will fly across the New York sky at 10:29 p.m. and the shuttle will trail just about 40 seconds behind. After the shuttle catches up and docks with the station, the two-as-one would be visible over New York on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 1 -- NASA scrubbed the launching of the shuttle Discovery minutes before its scheduled liftoff Saturday as threatening clouds encroached on the 20-mile boundary around the Kennedy Space Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The postponement came on the first day of a 19-day launching window, just before the start of a 10-minute span in which the launching pad enters the same orbital plane as the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liftoff is now scheduled for a 10-minute window starting at 3:26 p.m. on Sunday, but current weather forecasts put the likelihood of adverse conditions at 60 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions for Monday, according to forecasters working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, are likely to be even worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day flight to the space station is to be the second mission for the Discovery since the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven when it broke apart while re-entering the atmosphere on Feb. 1, 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays have always been part of the space program because of the complexity of spaceflight technology and the vagaries of weather.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes at NASA for good weather were high throughout the morning, which dawned bright and relatively clear. Dozens of government officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, came to the space center for the launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All morning, the issue causing more concern than the weather was a heater for one of the shuttle's six small thrusters that was not operating properly. But mission officials decided to work around that problem and launch anyway, since shuttle pilots are trained to work without all six thrusters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storms are another matter, however, and NASA does not launch when anvil-shaped clouds are near because of the potential for lightning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single anvil cloud began to dissipate before 3 p.m., but others began massing behind it. At 3:15, half an hour before the scheduled liftoff at 3:49, Bruce Buckingham, a NASA spokesman, announced, ''We are still no go for weather.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clouds near the launching site began to dissipate, but clouds massed over the landing strip -- another condition that prohibits liftoff because good visibility there is needed in case the flight is aborted soon after liftoff and the shuttle has to be brought back to the Kennedy landing site. Two minutes before the countdown was to resume, Michael Leinbach, the launching director, decided to delay resuming it to see if the weather would clear before the day's window closed. Though the seven astronauts had been strapped into their seats in the shuttle, with the hatch shut at 2 p.m., the mission managers gave the order to cancel liftoff at 3:42.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach apologized to the commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force. ''Sorry to break your string,'' he said, ''but we're not going to launch today.'' Mr. Leinbach added, ''We're going to try again tomorrow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey agreed. ''We'll launch when we're ready,'' he said. ''Hopefully, tomorrow will look better.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a brief interview on NASA television, Mr. Leinbach said, ''We played it till the end,'' but ran out of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't control the weather, and we have very strict rules,'' he said. ''It was very disappointing for the entire launch team.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added, ''We're not going to launch the vehicle unless it's safe.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather for Sunday, he said, is also at ''60 percent no-go,'' with a high probability of clouds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, NASA waits a day after two unsuccessful launching attempts to give the astronauts, ground crew and mission controllers the rest that allows them to remain sharp; two more consecutive days of launch attempts would follow. If the shuttle cannot be launched before July 19, the next window opens in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cheney, who was at Cape Canaveral with his wife and three granddaughters, said he was disappointed, according to Reuters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was really looking forward to today, especially looking forward to having my grandkids here,'' he said. ''But it was not to be today. Maybe it will work tomorrow.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 2 -- NASA scrubbed the launching of the shuttle Discovery for a second day today as thunderstorms and clouds cloaked the Kennedy Space Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We decided to terminate the count today, stand down for 48 hours," Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director, told Col. Steven W. Lindsey, the shuttle's commander, at 1:15 p.m., a little more than two hours before the scheduled liftoff. All seven astronauts had entered the craft, but workers had not yet closed the hatch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey replied, "Yeah, we copy, and looking out the window it doesn't look good today, and we think that's a great plan."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will now hold off launching until Tuesday at 2:38 p.m., with the extra day to keep the shuttle and launching crews fresh and to replenish the fuel cells, which provide electrical power to the orbiter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topping off the fuel cells on Monday will allow managers to keep an option of extending the 12-day mission by a day, which would be used for a spacewalk to practice repair techniques for the shuttle's delicate tiles and heat panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the decision to delay the mission, John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, said, "The one thing we really don't control weather kept us from launching."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach said NASA could try again on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday before having to shut down operations for three or four days to replenish fuels. The current time window, dictated by the space center's position in relation to the orbital plane of the International Space Station, closes on July 19. After that, the mission would have to be postponed until late August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of the scrubs on Saturday and Sunday, including the price of lost fuels and worker overtime for the weekend and holiday, is about $1 million each, Mr. Leinbach said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weather officer said that Tuesday could be a better day for launching. "Monday looked very similar to today," said First Lt. Kaleb Nordgren of the 45th Weather Squadron of the Air Force. "On Tuesday, the situation changes. We have much lighter upper-level winds, which decreases the chances of getting thunderstorms."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storms rolled through the area from the morning on. Three and a half hours before the scheduled liftoff, the Kennedy Space Center went into a "Phase II" lightning warning, which means that lightning has occurred within five miles of the site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission officials remained hopeful, if not optimistic, and the crew began the long process of strapping into their seats at around noon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather scrubs can be difficult for a shuttle crew, said Eileen M. Collins, the commander of the last shuttle mission a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's disappointing to have a weather scrub," said Commander Collins, who has since retired from the space agency. But she added that the astronauts were too busy to feel much emotion until they were out of the shuttle and back in the van to crew quarters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was commander of a mission in July 1999 that was postponed because of thunderstorms. "You're kind of revved up for the launch," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "laying on your back as long as you do can be pretty painful," she went on. "It takes a lot out of you."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article on July 3 about a decision by NASA to postpone the launching of the space shuttle Discovery until July 4 misstated a factor in the timing of the current mission. The space agency needed to launch the shuttle by July 19, or wait until late August, because of the amount of daylight required to photograph both the liftoff in Florida and the jettisoning of the external fuel tank over the Indian Ocean; the date was not dictated by the orbital plane of the International Space Station.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby and much younger and twice as massive as the Sun, Beta Pictoris is the bright star that cheered astronomers on to one of their biggest discoveries in recent time: finding planets around many other stars in the firmament.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although planets have yet to be definitively detected around Beta Pictoris itself, the first observations of a luminous disk of dust there made scientists in the 1980's think they were seeing conditions like those existing in the planet-forming stage of the early solar system. So they were not too surprised a decade ago when signs of actual extra-solar planets elsewhere started popping up in their telescopes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Beta Pictoris has revealed another phenomenon that astronomers say may be a typical aspect of planet-forming processes. A fainter secondary dust disk circles the star, possibly betraying the presence of a planet up to 20 times as massive as Jupiter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reported last week that detailed photography by the Hubble Space Telescope showed the existence of two distinct disks around the star. The secondary disk is visible out to more than 24 billion miles from the star and is tilted by about four degrees from the main disk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This confirms what had been suspected before,'' said David A. Golimowski of Johns Hopkins University, a member of the discovery team. ''The two disks suggest that planets could be forming there in two different planes, and this may even be the norm in the formative years of a star system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was described in the June issue of The Astronomical Journal and in a telephone interview with Dr. Golimowski, the lead author of the journal report. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said the new visible-light images were the best ever taken of Beta Pictoris, a relatively young star at less than 20 million years of age that is 63 light-years away in the southern constellation Pictor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous Hubble photographs had revealed an odd warp in the Beta Pictoris disk, and astronomers speculated that this was actually a separate disk. Computer modeling by scientists at Grenoble Observatory in France offered a possible explanation. The gravitational force of a large planet in an inclined orbit could draw small planetary objects and rocks out of the main disk and align them in the planet's own plane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Golimowski said this was still the best explanation, even though the planet organizing the second disk has so far eluded detection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers suspect that multiple disks of orbiting dust may be common to certain young stars. Recent observations have picked up hints of a double disk around another star. Even the 4.6-billion-year-old Sun, when much younger, might have had planets forming on different planes, which Dr. Golimowski said could explain why the solar system planets are typically inclined to Earth's orbit by several degrees.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 3 -- NASA will try to launch the space shuttle Discovery on Tuesday despite having learned on Monday that a small piece of foam had fallen off the external tank, officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're 'go' to continue with the launch countdown,'' said William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for space operations.'' Liftoff was set for 2:37 p.m.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small piece of foam insulation, which fell off a bracket that holds a fuel line in place, weighs less than one-tenth of an ounce, about as much as a penny, and would not have caused serious damage to the shuttle if it had fallen off during ascent, said John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers and officials spent the day trying to determine, among other things, whether the remaining foam would stay in place and whether the missing foam might cause ice to form on the bracket that could fall and damage the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an afternoon briefing with reporters at the Kennedy Space Center, John Chapman, the external tank manager, said the loss of some foam did not automatically mean that the vehicle was unsafe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the decision is likely to raise concerns among those who worry that the space agency has let safety standards slip in the face of pressure to launch the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said ''launch fever'' was not part of the decision. ''We've laid out the data,'' he said. ''We've looked at it calmly. We're ready to go fly because we're ready to go fly. We're not ready to fly because of some launch window, or some other condition.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent briefings, NASA officials have suggested that some reporters had overblown the risks of shedding foam, especially in the broader context of the risks of space flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mass of a piece of foam from the tank is small, Mr. Gerstenmaier said in a briefing last week, ''that could be absolutely no concern to us,'' even if the surface area of the lost foam was 85 square inches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Columbia was destroyed on re-entry in February 2003, and its crew was killed, after a much larger piece of insulation, weighing 1.67 pounds, fell and damaged its heat shield. NASA grounded the fleet and spent more than $1 billion trying to correct insulation problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several NASA employees said that in the past a piece of foam of the size that fell from the tank this time would not have raised concerns. The launching has been delayed two times because of the weather.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it would not have gotten as much attention prior to Columbia as it is getting now,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''I think it is a very good thing that we have the sensitivity, and we're looking this close at the vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the afternoon briefing, managers seemed inclined to move toward launching without a close-up inspection, which would have required an extra day. They argued that the inspection team, working 25 feet from the structure that flanks the shuttle, had tools like borescopes that could help examine the tank for damage at a distance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, a plastic pipe extension for the borescope camera allowed an examination to take place from about a foot away, and so several inspectors get a close look. ''We actually got data that's as good or better than we could have gotten by delaying,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the discussion was lively, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, no one on the mission management team or the shuttle astronauts, who were listening in, dissented from the decision. The NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, listened ''intently'' to the discussion, he said, but ''didn't raise any questions or comments.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, Mr. Griffin, overruled his own chief engineer and safety officer, who wanted to delay launching until more work could be done to resolve the foam problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first day of trying to launch the craft, managers decided that it was safe to fly despite problems that would probably have made one of the 44 on-orbit thrusters inoperable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said he was not troubled by the notion that the shuttle might fly with missing foam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon, a member of the independent board that investigated the Columbia disaster, said, ''Prior to Columbia, we flew 113 times with foam apparently falling off without it hurting us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, he said, NASA did not understand the problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now that we are aware of it and have learned about it,'' he said, ''it's more reasonable to fly with falling foam, because we at least understand the issue better.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The triangular chunk of foam that fell to the launch pad below is about four inches long and looks ''like this small piece of bread crust,'' Mr. Shannon said at the briefing. It was found on a routine inspection, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bracket is designed to allow some movement as the extreme cold of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen shrinks and flexes the tank and the supply line. NASA officials said the rain on Sunday caused ice to form in a nook in the bracket assembly. The ice then pinched the foam when the structure moved, causing the foam to crack and fall off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insulating foam that gives the external fuel tank its eye-catching orange color has been a source of risk and consternation since the beginning of the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foam is necessary to prevent ice from forming on the tank, which contains hundreds of thousands of gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Falling ice could damage the shuttle. But as NASA saw from the Columbia disaster, falling foam can be a danger, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the lone shuttle flight since then, by the Discovery a year ago, the shedding of foam was greatly reduced, but pieces did break free that could have damaged the heat shield. That prompted NASA to address the problem again, including removing more than 35 pounds of foam and making other changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery and its crew of seven had planned to take off on a 12-day test flight on Saturday, but the mission was put off to Sunday and then to Tuesday because of storms.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Q&amp;A column in Science Times on July 4, about inventions devised for the space program that are now in everyday use, referred incorrectly to bar codes. Although NASA used them to keep track of parts, the bar codes actually predate the space program, having been invented around 1952.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gadgets From Space  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What inventions developed for the space program are in everyday use?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. NASA lists a wealth of useful devices and technologies that have made the trip from space to the average home, including smoke detectors and the modern bar codes used on virtually every consumer product.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before they became essential in stores, bar codes were used to keep track of spacecraft parts, and smoke detectors were used in the 1970's Skylab space station to warn of toxic vapors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program also developed the means that satellite dishes use to clean up TV signals, used first to keep communications from space clear.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cordless power tools were developed to help Apollo astronauts drill for moon samples. Some low-cost space plastics, called liquid-crystal polymers, turned out to be good for inexpensive food and beverage containers as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some space-related inventions are invaluable in special circumstances, if not in everyday use, like the translucent ceramic used to make invisible braces to straighten teeth, a spinoff of NASA ceramics research; improvements in various medical-imaging systems; the ear thermometer, which uses a lens to measure infrared energy emissions; and fire-resistant fabrics used in firefighters' uniforms, developed for space suits.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large asteroid hurtled harmlessly past Earth at a distance of about 269,000 miles, slightly farther away than the moon. Residents with telescopes in the United States and Canada had the best view of the asteroid, 2004 XP14, which appeared as a streaking dot in the northern sky. Judging by its brightness, 2004 XP14 was estimated to be a quarter-mile to a half-mile wide. An asteroid that size, if it smashed into Earth, would probably cause regional destruction. Scientists have said it would take an asteroid a mile wide or larger to cause widespread devastation that could threaten civilization. Asteroid encounters are not uncommon. More than three dozen asteroids have flown closer to Earth in the last few years. But the latest was thought to be among the largest to have flown by.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparently successful launch of the shuttle Discovery is cause for restrained jubilation. The astronauts are not out of danger yet. Only further inspections will tell whether their fragile vehicle sustained any significant damage on ascent. Even before takeoff, inspectors discovered a piece of damaged foam insulation -- the threat that most troubled NASA. But engineers decided it was not a risk to either the ship or its crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The striking thing about this shuttle flight is that the most important task is simply survival -- of both the vehicle and the astronauts who are riding in it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program has been brought to this state by the disastrous loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and the failure to fully eliminate the foam-shedding problem that caused that accident, despite three years of trying. In recent weeks, NASA decided to go ahead with the launch anyway so as to get started on the remaining 16 flights needed to complete the international space station before the aging shuttles are retired for good in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This flight will be full of mundane tasks that are vitally necessary to the space station project. The shuttle will carry up a new crew member for the station. He will join the two on board, who are serving as minimal caretakers but are unable to devote much time to research. Discovery will also unload tons of supplies and equipment for the station and will haul back tons of accumulated trash. Two astronauts will venture outside the shuttle to perform repair and maintenance on the station. All these activities should inject a little more life into the moribund station, which has been limping along on short rations since the Columbia disaster grounded its main supply line.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By far the most important work on this flight involves ensuring the survival of the crew. Should any damage be found that would prevent returning to Earth, the astronauts would be transferred to the crowded space station to await rescue by another shuttle or by Russian space vehicles. The astronauts might conceivably try to repair the damage in orbit, although that seems less likely given the rudimentary capacity for such repairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their scheduled activities include testing the stability of the long extension boom as a platform for shuttle repairs and, if there is time, testing methods to repair damaged shield segments in space. The astronauts are clearly only learning how to repair a damaged shuttle and may not be ready to do it in a crisis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of the shuttle program may depend on whether Discovery returns to Earth safely. Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, has said he would try to shut the program down if another vehicle is lost. That would end all hope of completing the space station and of sending up a final mission to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most productive scientific instrument.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 4 -- The space shuttle Discovery split a nearly cloudless sky with thunder and fire on Tuesday afternoon and roared safely into orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liftoff, right on schedule at 2:38 p.m., was the start of a 13-day flight that is the first in a year for the diminished shuttle fleet as NASA continues its efforts to resume more frequent human spaceflight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is to rendezvous on Thursday with the International Space Station, where it is carrying equipment, supplies and a fresh astronaut for the station's crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is also considered the second and final test flight for the shuttle fleet since the loss of the Columbia and its seven astronauts in 2003, and the Discovery's ascent was scrutinized for the kind of liftoff debris that caused that disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 2 minutes 53 seconds into the flight, an onboard camera showed numerous pieces of debris appearing to fall away from the external fuel tank. They fluttered away and did not appear to strike the shuttle, carrying a crew of seven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., NASA's shuttle program chief, said the pieces had fallen ''after the time we are concerned about,'' after the air becomes so thin that debris usually floats harmlessly away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A piece of debris that broke off later in the ascent did appear to strike the midbody of the orbiter, NASA officials said. But they added that it probably did not do any damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, officials said, insulating foam broke away from five spots on the external fuel tank and a solid rocket booster, some with several pieces of foam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none occurred within the time that NASA considers hazardous, and only one piece might be larger than the allowable size. Batteries of cameras on the Discovery and the space station are photographing every square inch of the shuttle's surface during the mission. If serious damage is found, NASA plans call for the crew to abandon the shuttle and seek ''safe haven'' inside the station until a rescue mission can begin .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials were jubilant about the liftoff. ''They don't get much better than this,'' said NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, who had been criticized for overruling engineering and safety officials last month after they recommended postponing the mission for more study of debris hazards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he felt vindicated, Mr. Griffin replied that the successful liftoff simply represented good, solid engineering.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We keep coming back to feelings, you know,'' he said. ''I'll have time for feelings after I'm dead. Right now we're busy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally scheduled for last Saturday, the Discovery's liftoff had been delayed twice by threatening weather. But the Fourth of July dawned with bright skies that all but guaranteed launching, though there were concerns about crosswinds in the hours before liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the moment of liftoff neared, NASA's launching director, Michael D. Leinbach, polled the shuttle's support teams for their approval to launch. All gave it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery is ready,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''The weather is beautiful, and America is ready to return to space. Good luck and godspeed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, responded, ''I can't think of a better place to be than here on the Fourth of July.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey then addressed the thousands of spectators along the coast, saying he hoped to give them ''a close and personal look at the rockets' red glare.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the engines and boosters lifted the craft with a roar into a sky so clear that the flames were visible even when the shuttle had risen more than 60 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main engines cut off, as planned, at the eight-and-a-half-minute mark, the moment that those familiar with the dangers of ascent are finally able to take a full breath. Soon after, the external tank was released and fell away toward the ocean, and the craft resumed its course toward the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has had a long road back from the Columbia disaster, when the nation's oldest shuttle broke up over Texas and Louisiana on Feb. 1, 2003, as it returned to the Florida landing strip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation of the accident found that a 1.67-pound piece of insulating foam had punched a hole in the left wing during the ascent and, moreover, that a ''broken safety culture'' at NASA had let schedule and budget pressures overcome safety concerns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, NASA has worked on correcting both problems. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on eliminating sources of foam debris from the external tank, and the agency took steps to ensure that dissenting voices were heard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year ago, during the Discovery's return-to-flight mission, the external tank shed less foam than before, but several pieces did fall, one weighing nearly a pound.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did no damage but led the space agency to hold off flying until the problem was better understood and corrected. NASA removed 35 additional pounds of foam from the tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, engineering and safety officials recommended against launching because tests showed that small amounts of foam might fall off the ramps that cover brackets along the length of the tank. That insulation protects against ice and frost that build up as humid air condenses on the outside of the fuel tank and is frozen by the supercooled fuel inside it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers had said a ''catastrophic'' foam strike was ''probable'' at some point over 100 shuttle missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Griffin overruled the managers, saying he disagreed with those characterizations. He noted that the chief risk was to the vehicle and not the crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three shuttles remaining in the national fleet are scheduled to fly 16 more missions to complete work on the half-finished space station; a flight may be added to service the Hubble Space Telescope. President Bush has called for retiring the shuttle fleet by 2010, so NASA will have to return to its historic average of 4.5 missions a year to reach the goal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the day of maintenance between the first two attempts and Tuesday's liftoff, the discovery of damaged foam on a bracket that secures the liquid oxygen fuel line to the external tank led engineers to spend a day of intense study and discussion before deciding that the foam did not constitute a risk to the craft or crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once in orbit, one astronaut, Michael E. Fossum, radioed mission control in Houston to report that the crew had spotted what appeared to be a strip of fabric as long as six feet floating away from the Discovery, about 15 minutes after liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really looked a lot like the FRSI insulation,'' Mr. Fossum told the managers, referring to part of the heat-resistant blankets that cover the top of the orbiter. (The acronym, pronounced ''frizzy,'' stands for flexible reusable surface insulation.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA managers determined that it was not insulation but harmless ice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is to continue testing scores of modifications made since the loss of the Columbia, including ways to inspect and repair potential damage to the shuttle's heat shield. On the way to the station, the astronauts are to spend most of their second day in space using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, with a 50-foot boom tipped with a camera and laser imager, to inspect heat-protecting materials on the orbiter's underside, nose and wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the third day of flight, the shuttle will approach the station for docking. Before the linkup, Colonel Lindsey will stop the craft about 600 feet away and perform a back-flip maneuver to pitch the 100-ton orbiter nose-up, allowing the station crew to take detailed pictures of the bottom with still cameras.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week of joint operations are planned. The Discovery will transfer tons of supplies and new equipment carried in an Italian-made module called Leonardo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will feature two spacewalks, and possibly three. The first two will involve station repairs and adding equipment. If controllers determine that the Discovery has enough power and oxygen for an extra day at the station, the astronauts will venture out for a third time to test experimental methods that might be used to repair potential damage to the shuttle's wing and nose heat shields.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said Tuesday that they hoped to launch Atlantis as early as Aug. 28 to resume space-station construction.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 5 -- NASA engineers and managers expressed optimism Wednesday that the shuttle Discovery had come through its ascent to orbit with no damage and substantially less shedding of foam debris from the external tank than in previous flights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are very excited that they have not been surprised by anything,'' said John Shannon, shuttle deputy program manager, after a briefing with reporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this second day of its mission, the shuttle raced to catch up with the International Space Station, which it is scheduled to dock with on Thursday at 10:52 a.m. Meanwhile, the astronauts began their detailed inspection of the spacecraft for possible damage and managers revealed detailed photographs of the external tank after it had been set loose from the ascending craft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crew members released the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm and used a package of sensors and cameras on the end to check heat shield material on the craft's nose and wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said that all of the examinations so far had been preliminary, and that far more data would be collected over the next few days as more examinations of the craft followed. On Thursday, for example, the space station crew will take detailed photographs of the shuttle's belly as the craft approaches the station at close range and does a 360-degree pirouette, known as the rotational pitch maneuver.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Shannon blended a measure of caution into the briefing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't seen anything yet,'' he said, ''but the rotational pitch maneuver is going to tell us a whole bunch about the condition of the exterior of the vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was only the second time astronauts have done such a detailed inspection of the outer hull of a shuttle after launching; the first was during the Discovery's flight a year ago to check safety modifications ordered since the Columbia accident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia disintegrated on Feb. 1, 2003, while returning to Earth because of damage to a wing caused by pieces of insulating foam that fell from the external fuel tank and struck the shuttle during launching. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration then grounded the shuttle fleet and spent more than $1 billion to redesign the orbiters, focusing on stopping large chunks of foam from breaking away during launchings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some large pieces fell off during the Discovery's flight last year, prompting more redesign and delay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several areas on the external tank did lose some foam, Mr. Shannon said, including an area about the size of a sheet of notebook paper that appeared to have peeled off in six pieces. But the foam in that area was too thin for the pieces to have significant mass, he said, and they fell off later in the mission than the time when the agency considers such events hazardous to the ship.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several areas that had shed foam in the past and that had been redesigned did not shed foam this time, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues have cropped up in the early evaluations that appear to be minor, officials said. The photographic sweep revealed that a single strip of stiff felt known as gap filler that sits between insulating tiles was found to be poking out underneath one of the shuttle's wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In last year's flight, a gap filler near the nose of the craft caused concern about the possibility that it might cause uneven heating downstream on the craft, and the astronaut Stephen Robinson removed it during a spacewalk. This gap filler does not appear to be in an area that would lead to similar concern, Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tony Ceccacci, the lead flight director, said at a Wednesday afternoon news briefing that a pattern of unusual white stains had been seen on the shuttle's right wing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ceccacci said that he had seen the splotch in images and that he had seen similar white markings in the same place while inspecting the shuttle on the ground three weeks ago. He added that seen from a distance of 10 feet or so, the markings looked like bird droppings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't touch anything, if that's what you're asking,'' Mr. Ceccacci said to the amusement of reporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagery experts will study the stain and make a final determination, he said. If the markings are bird droppings, he said, they will burn off during the Discovery's fiery return from space.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>754 words</div><div>7 July 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 6 -- The space shuttle Discovery glided Thursday morning to a smooth rendezvous with the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach, at a gradual one-tenth of a foot per second as both craft raced through orbit at 17,500 miles an hour, could be seen on NASA Television from a camera mounted in the Discovery's docking mechanism.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capture confirmed,'' the shuttle's commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, radioed to mission control at 10:52 a.m. Eastern time, when the two spacecraft joined about 220 miles above Earth, south of Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific. By 12:30 p.m., the crews had opened the hatch separating them and exchanged handshakes and hugs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before docking, the Discovery, in its second full day in orbit, did a back flip of greeting as it approached the space station. During the maneuver, in which Colonel Lindsey pulled up the nose of the craft at three degrees per second, the 122-foot-long, 245,000-pound shuttle turned as gracefully as a gymnast, though an extremely large one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gave crew members on the station, Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia and Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the United States Army, the flight engineer, a leisurely view of the bottom of the Discovery so they could take 350 highly detailed photographs of it. The flip was part of the program of inspection put in place after the 2003 Columbia disaster, when an undetected hole in the left wing caused that shuttle to break up during re-entry, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was only the second time that the maneuver had been performed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey executed the maneuver with the help of a small thruster, known as a Vernier, that developed a balky thermostat last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem had threatened to delay the mission, but NASA elected to launch without fixing the thruster, saying the astronauts could maneuver without it. Once in orbit, Colonel Lindsey kept the left side of the shuttle facing the sun, which warmed the craft and brought the thruster up to operating temperature.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coast of Spain was clearly visible beneath the Discovery as the maneuver began, and the hills and clouds slid by underneath.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut aboard the Discovery, officially joined the station's crew, bringing its complement to three for the first time since the Columbia disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony J. Ceccacci, the lead flight director for the mission, said at an afternoon briefing for reporters that the mission was going according to plan -- so much so, in fact, that it threatened to become a bit dull.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's boring to us that it's quiet,'' he said. ''But that's a good thing. That means everything is going well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, mission managers will be discussing several issues. Two pieces of stiff cloth that fit between tiles, which are known as gap fillers, are poking up from between tiles on the left wing and toward the rear of the shuttle. Since any protruding object can cause unusual heating during re-entry, the managers will discuss whether the fillers constitute a threat and need to be removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, noted that a breakaway patch of thin foam that he described yesterday as being 8 inches by 10 inches was actually more than 12 by 14. That larger patch was still within the range that the agency expected to see, Mr. Shannon said, and did not constitute a threat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the shuttle crew will transfer an Italian-made cargo carrier, known as Leonardo, from the shuttle to the station so that the 5,000 pounds of supplies inside can be loaded into the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the early afternoon briefing on Thursday, Mr. Ceccacci also talked about Mr. Reiter's ''seat liner,'' the soft shell that is tailored to the astronauts' bodies so they are not injured on the rough ride back to Earth. It was transferred to the space station along with him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When reporters asked Mr. Ceccacci whether the lack of seat liners for the shuttle astronauts meant that they could not return to Earth on a Soyuz in case of orbiter damage, he said that in an emergency, other options always emerged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll tell you what,'' he said. ''I'd take the chance. I'd wrap myself in bubble wrap if I had to to get home safely.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 7 -- On a day devoted to moving thousands of pounds of supplies from the space shuttle Discovery to the International Space Station, engineers and analysts on the ground scrutinized images of the shuttle on Friday for damage that might cause problems in the brutal heat of re-entry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said that the shuttle came through the rigors of ascent in a remarkably clean state and that they had narrowed their analysis to a few unresolved issues.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news briefing on Friday, Steve Poulos, the space shuttle orbiter projects manager, said analysts were still examining two blemishes on the hard panels that line the leading edge of the right wing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poulos added that teams were continuing to work through questions about a piece of stiff cloth known as a gap filler, which sits between tiles so they do not rub against each other as the shuttle flexes. The filler is poking out from the underside of the craft, toward the rear; a similar piece near the nose was removed by a spacewalking astronaut during the Discovery's mission last summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are also trying to determine whether a blemish on the nose of the vehicle was a weakened spot, Mr. Poulos said, or something as harmless as bird droppings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. Poulos nor John Shannon, the deputy shuttle chief and leader of the mission management team, appeared to be worried about any of the three issues, though they said they were withholding judgment until the analysis was complete.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't rule out anything until the analysts come out and say it's not a problem,'' Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the briefing, the officials also announced that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had decided to extend the mission by a day to add a third spacewalk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mission managers do decide to have an astronaut remove the gap fillers, that bit of maintenance would take place during the added spacewalk, on the ninth day of the mission. The walk, which mission planners had long considered but which depended on the condition of the shuttle's fuel cells, will be devoted to testing repair techniques that the space agency is developing for the shuttle's delicate insulating tiles and panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first spacewalk of the mission will take six and a half hours starting Saturday morning and will involve repairs to a minirailcar system on the outside of the station that transports equipment. In another experiment on the first spacewalk, two astronauts, Piers J. Sellers and Michael E. Fossum, will ride at the end of the shuttle's robot arm and extension boom, which together stretch 100 feet, to get a feel for the swaying and bouncing that might occur during a repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is too much motion, NASA engineers may have to come up with another solution, like a platform that could be temporarily attached to the outside of the shuttle, to support repair work, Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a midday briefing, Anthony J. Ceccacci, the lead flight director for the mission, said it would be premature to try to use the first spacewalk to remove the gap filler until the characteristics of riding on the boom were well understood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One baby step at a time,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 8 -- Two astronauts from the shuttle Discovery ended a spacewalk of more than seven and a half hours after doing a bit of on-orbit repair to a malfunctioning part of the International Space Station and testing a new use for the shuttle's robot arm and sensor boom as a work platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts two Piers J. Sellers and Michael E. Fossum returned to the space station's Quest airlock just after 4:30 Eastern.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts began easing out of the airlock at 9:17 a.m. The two major objectives of the spacewalk were fixing a small railway car on the outside of the station that transports equipment and testing their ability to use the 100-foot-long extended shuttle boom for shuttle inspection and repair -- an exercise that has been dubbed "bouncing on the boom." In the morning packet of messages and instructions sent up to the shuttle, mission managers joked that the exercise "Sounds like a new country song."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task involved making sure that the power and data cable to the transporter were safe. The transporter has two sets of the cables, to ensure that if one fails the other will still work. But in December, the transporter's cable cutter, a safety device for overcoming snags, cut one of the cables. NASA still does not know why, but managers of the space station wanted to keep the other cutter from sabotaging the other cable, since the transporter is essential for completing construction on the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attempt to block the cutter with a bolt on a previous space walk by the space station crew was unsuccessful, but Mr. Fossum was able to install the blocker on this walk. A second step to restoring the transporter will come on Monday, when the astronauts will replace the cut cable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts then moved on to the second objective of the spacewalk, which is to test the ability of astronauts to use the 50-foot extension to the shuttle's 50-foot Robot arm as a work platform for shuttle inspection and repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That task involved attaching a work platform to the end of the boom and then taking a ride on the platform, mimicking motions that they would make during repairs to the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the shuttle, astronauts Lisa Nowak and Stephanie Wilson operated the robotic arms for the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before climbing aboard the boom, Mr. Fossom found "It definitely moves with just a few pounds" of pressure. "Whoa, look at that," he said, as it oscillated in front of him. But as the tests progressed, it the boom wobbled less than NASA engineers had predicted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers, who was taking his fourth spacewalk, was the lead spacewalker on this excursion, and could be seen on camera wearing a suit with red stripes. Mr. Fossum, a first-time spacewalker, wore a plain white space suit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next space walk is scheduled to begin on Monday, and will involve installing a spare pump to the station's thermal control system and completing the work on the transporter.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 8 -- Two astronauts from the shuttle Discovery took a seven-and-a-half-hour walk outside on Saturday, doing a bit of repair work to a malfunctioning part of the International Space Station and testing whether the shuttle's robot arm and sensor boom can be used as a work platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts, Piers J. Sellers and Michael E. Fossum, began easing out of the space station's Quest airlock at 9:17 a.m. Eastern time and returned at 4:48 p.m.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on the ground, mission managers continued to examine questionable spots on the shuttle's exterior to decide whether any of them constituted a threat to the craft and crew in the shuttle's fiery re-entry through the earth's atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have cleared all but two of what mission managers called ''regions of interest,'' Steve Poulos, the space shuttle orbiter projects manager, said during an afternoon briefing at the Johnson Space Center here. ''Yesterday, things were a little fuzzy,'' he said, ''and today, things are a lot more clear.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysts, he said, are still examining a stiff piece of cloth, known as a gap filler, that is poking from the belly of the shuttle toward the back of the craft. Gap fillers that poke up between tiles might disrupt the flow of superheated gases over the shuttle and cause uneven heating. But high-resolution photographs showed that the gap filler was likely to lay flat during re-entry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another area under examination, a bit of insulating blanket near a window on upper surface of the orbiter that appears to be slightly out of place, will probably be cleared within 24 hours as well, Mr. Poulos said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other marks on wing panels now appear, under closer inspection, to be harmless drips of hydraulic fluid or sooty stains from the exhaust of the motors that pushed away the solid rocket boosters. A spot on the nose of the vehicle, under close examination, turned out to be bird droppings -- or, as Mr. Poulos put it, a ''surface deposit.'' Over all, Mr. Poulos said, ''This is the best, cleanest orbiter I've seen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of damaging foam debris in the Discovery's liftoff does not mean that the space program can claim victory, said John Shannon, the deputy manager of the shuttle program. ''Now that we're so sensitive to the state of the foam,'' he said, ''we're going to look for continuous improvement.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task for the spacewalkers, fixing a small railway car on the outside of the station that transports equipment, involved making sure that the power and data cable to the transporter was safe. The transporter has two sets of the cables, with one as a backup. But in December, the transporter's cable cutter, a safety device for overcoming snags, cut one of the cables.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA still does not know why it malfunctioned, but managers of the space station wanted to keep the other cutter from sabotaging its cable, since the transporter is essential for completing construction on the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attempt to block the cutter with a bolt on a previous spacewalk by the space station crew was unsuccessful, but Mr. Fossum was able to install the blocker on this walk. A second step to restoring the transporter will come on Monday, when the astronauts will replace the cut cable and assembly on the other side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts then moved on to the second task, testing the use of the 50-foot extension to the Discovery's 50-foot robot arm as a work platform for shuttle inspection and repair. The astronauts attached a work platform to the end of the boom and then took turns riding on the platform, mimicking motions that they would make during repairs to the shuttle. Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration called this process ''bouncing on the boom.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lead flight director for the mission, Anthony J. Ceccacci, said that his team was pleasantly surprised to find that the boom stopped its swaying in 20 seconds or less, not the 60 seconds they had predicted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hopefully, we'll never have to use it,'' he said, ''but we know we'll have the capability if we do need to.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the fourth spacewalk for Mr. Sellers, and the first for Mr. Fossum. Inside the shuttle, Lisa M. Nowak and Stephanie D. Wilson operated the robotic arms for the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems with balky tethers, which hold astronauts to the shuttle while they move around, caused delays. ''We had problems with almost every tether we touched today,'' the mission's lead officer for spacewalks, Thomas Gonzales-Torres, said at the briefing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the spacewalk may have lacked in drama it made up for in humor. The astronauts outside traded quips with those inside the shuttle, and dealt with obstacles with sheepish amusement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Fossum moved to take Mr. Sellers's place on the robot arm, his safety tether stubbornly refused to retract. Engineers on the ground worked through the problem and, stumped, finally asked the astronauts to get a spare tether -- but, just before sending them to retrieve it, asked one more thing. ''We want to just make sure it's in the unlocked position,'' came the message from earth. The astronauts checked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers said, ''It's in the locked position.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fossum exclaimed, ''No!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, no!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, radioed back to mission control, ''Thanks for that recommendation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chagrined Mr. Fossum said, ''Oh, that's pretty embarrassing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: In a spacewalk yesterday, Michael E. Fossum and Piers J. Sellers worked on a transport system outside the space station and tested whether a 50-foot robot arm and its extension could be used in shuttle repairs. (Photo by NASA TV)  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 9 -- Mission Control informed the crew of the space shuttle Discovery on Sunday that the ship's thermal shielding was ''100 percent cleared for entry'' in a week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One heat shield issue remained going into the afternoon mission management meeting: a two-inch-long piece of fabric filler sticking out about an inch from thermal tiles on Discovery's belly. But engineers determined that it was not necessary to have an astronaut pluck the strip out in a spacewalk and that it posed no concern for the spaceship's return to Earth on July 17.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials had already decided that several other nicks and spots -- things like bird droppings and frayed fabric -- were of no concern.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, astronauts will perform a spacewalk, beginning at 8:13 a.m. Eastern time. The bulk of the scheduled six-and-a-half-hour walk will concentrate on finishing repairs on the International Space Station's railcar-like mobile transporter. This is a crucial piece of the station that slides back and forth, helping in its expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need that thing to be working to move big pieces around during assembly,'' Piers J. Sellers, the flight engineer, said Sunday. ''It was dead on one side, kind of limping on just two wheels.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers and Lt. Col. Michael E. Fossum of the Air Force Reserve will replace part of the transporter's umbilical reel, which weighs about 330 pounds on the ground.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what may be an awkward maneuver, Mr. Sellers will hold the old umbilical in one hand and the new one in the other, Mr. Fossum said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most challenging thing tomorrow is going to be just the choreography, going back and forth in the payload bay,'' Colonel Fossum said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, Mr. Sellers and Colonel Fossum made a seven-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, which included testing an extension of the shuttle's robot arm. They said standing on the end of an oscillating 100-foot robotic arm was unusual.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You find yourself lying sideways when you think you're standing up,'' Mr. Sellers said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article on July 3 about a decision by NASA to postpone the launching of the space shuttle Discovery until July 4 misstated a factor in the timing of the current mission. The space agency needed to launch the shuttle by July 19, or wait until late August, because of the amount of daylight required to photograph both the liftoff in Florida and the jettisoning of the external fuel tank over the Indian Ocean; the date was not dictated by the orbital plane of the International Space Station.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 10 -- Is the space shuttle Discovery safe to re-enter the atmosphere on its way to landing next Monday?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining that it is, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration did on Sunday, is an arduous process. Even though engineers and analysts say there is really no choice for an agency still climbing back from a horrendous re-entry accident -- the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven on a bright February morning in 2003 -- the level of detail can sometimes seem absurd.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blame the tools that have been developed since the Columbia disaster. They give such stunningly clear and detailed images of the shuttle from orbit that there are endless new problems to worry about.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, mission managers announced results of their close look at every suspicious mark and irregularity on the shuttle surface, including stiff bits of cloth called gap fillers that were poking out of the underbelly, as well as loosened patches on insulating blankets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Columbia, such problems would have probably not been noticed. Now, each becomes a potentially troubling issue, to be dealt with one by one by one by one. On Sunday, the sixth day of the 13-day flight, Steve Poulos, the orbiter projects office manager, said every item had finally been checked off.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not only did the team pound these issues flat,'' Mr. Poulos said. ''They put a dimple in the board when it was all said and done.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also pondered an octopus-shape black mark on the leading edge of the right wing that turned out to be soot from the craft's small rockets and a suspicious white mark that appeared to have a black center that turned out not to be a dangerous ding, but dung. Or, more precisely, bird droppings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it seems like a bit much, NASA managers remind reporters that re-entry is unforgiving, and the loss of the Columbia is still all too fresh. They point out that the analysis took far less time than on the Discovery mission a year ago and that NASA is developing techniques to quickly discern potential hazards from mere schmutz.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Camps on Foam   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Discovery was launched last Tuesday, the chief safety officer and the chief engineer of NASA recommended that the mission be delayed until more work could be done to resolve the problem that doomed the Columbia and plagued last year's return-to-flight mission, foam falling from the external tank at liftoff. They were overruled by the agency administrator, Michael D. Griffin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now managers are exulting over the remarkable lack of damage to the orbiter. But some of those who had suggested delay pointed out that foam did, in fact, fall off, including a patch larger than 12 by 14 inches.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both sides can claim victory on this,'' said an engineer who favored a delay and who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about internal NASA activities. The engineer added, ''It's just like politics.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the cautious camp, he said, ''we'll say we had a major foam loss'' and push for more work to be done. But the other side could say, ''Everything's beautiful.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a briefing with reporters on Saturday, the deputy manager of the shuttle program, John Shannon, sought the middle course.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm fairly confident that we will never finish redesigning the external tank,'' Mr. Shannon said. Until the program ends in 2010, he added, ''we're going to be in a state of continual improvement.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggie Jokes   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michael E. Fossum struggled with a tether on Saturday on his spacewalk and found he had not noticed that it was in the locked position, many Texans had a two-word explanation -- Aggie astronaut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggies are students at Texas A&amp;M University, and they have long been the butt of dumb-guy jokes across the state. A sample: Aggie scientists announce plans to launch a mission to explore the surface of the sun. ''But the ship and anyone in it will burn up!'' other scientists exclaim. ''Shows how much y'all know,'' the Aggies respond. ''We're going at night.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fossum, as it happens, is the first person with an undergraduate degree from A&amp;M to reach space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a news conference on Saturday when the manager of spacewalks for the mission, Thomas Gonzales-Torres, was asked whether there had been Aggie jokes. ''I think there will be some now,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reporter asked Mr. Fossum on a video link, ''After the locked-tether incident yesterday, have you heard any new Aggie jokes?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts broke into raucous laughter, and Mr. Fossum smiled. ''Oh, real fine,'' he replied. ''I guess I knew that was coming.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Than One Entendre   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has a language all its own, a jumble of jargon, euphemism and colorfully geeky terms that make commonly used phrases somehow end up sounding surreal or even vaguely indecent. The spacewalk in which two astronauts rode on the robot arm and boom extender and simulated motions for inspection and repair to check wobble and sway was called ''bouncing on the boom.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space to transfer materials is the ''bungee jail.'' A gap filler with a rounded top peeking out was named the ''tadpole gap filler,'' and the infamous guano was ''surface deposit'' or a ''surface artifact.'' Reporters for Agence France-Presse used ''fiente,'' which sounds almost elegant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: Piers J. Sellers was one of two astronauts who spent nearly seven hours yesterday on a spacewalk to make repairs to the International Space Station. The work was rigorous, and Mr. Sellers said, ''This is a beast.'' (Photo by NASA)   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 10 -- Two astronauts from the space shuttle Discovery spent nearly seven hours outside the International Space Station on Monday in the second spacewalk of their 13-day mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The walk, to repair parts of the space station, began at 8:14 a.m., Eastern time. The astronauts, Michael E. Fossum and Piers J. Sellers, completed their work and, sounding thoroughly winded, began re-entering the airlock about 2:45 p.m. The spacewalk officially ended at 3:01.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was rigorous. ''This is a beast,'' Mr. Sellers said at one point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task was attaching a bar to part of a pump for the space station so two other astronauts, Lisa M. Nowak and Stephanie D. Wilson, could work inside the station to grab the assembly with the station's robotic arm and move it into position for installation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the bar was in place, Mr. Sellers and Mr. Fossum moved on to the next task: replacing part of a transporter for equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station is only half-built, and continuing the construction requires that the transporter work. The transporter is like a remote-controlled railway car; it has two cables to carry power and data so that if one is damaged, the transporter can still work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA requires that the transporter have two good cables. But a safety device that is supposed to undo snags by cutting a cable fired unexpectedly in December, disabling one of the two cables. The space agency has not yet determined why that happened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their first spacewalk, on Saturday, Mr. Fossum and Mr. Sellers installed a metal device to keep the other cutter from slicing its cable. Monday's spacewalk involved replacing a cable-reeling assembly on what is known as the trailing umbilical system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They removed the old cable-reeling unit, but the spacewalk stretched on as Mr. Fossum struggled to put the new one in place, a task that required more force than is easily applied in a microgravity environment. Mr. Sellers came over to work with Mr. Fossum to wrestle it into place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers, while unlatching the old umbilical assembly, said he was ''going slow here,'' and added, ''Don't want to bump anything expensive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fossum replied, ''It's all expensive.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 11 -- Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery continued to move supplies into the International Space Station on Tuesday while fielding a phone call from President Bush and preparing for their third and final spacewalk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crews of the shuttle and the space station received a late morning private call from Mr. Bush, who said he had seen part of a Monday spacewalk in which the astronauts repaired a remote-controlled sled that crosses rails atop the station, and wanted to thank them for their service to the country. He also invited the Discovery crew and their families to visit the White House after the mission, a White House spokesman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials and astronauts also said that they were feeling good about the success of the Discovery's mission so far, and believed that the shuttle program was ready to resume the task of completing the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle appears to have come through launching with little or no damage, evidence that the time and expense of many modifications had worked, Anthony J. Ceccacci, the mission's lead flight director, said at a news conference here at the Johnson Space Center. In addition, two successful spacewalks by the Discovery astronauts put the station in shape for continued expansion on future missions, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives everybody a really good feeling that we're getting there,'' Mr. Ceccacci said. ''It's time to get going and start building the station.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts voiced the same confidence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My brother put it very well,'' the shuttle pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly, told The Associated Press in an interview from space, describing a telephone conversation with his twin and fellow astronaut Scott Kelly. ''He said 'We're back, baby!' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts Piers J. Sellers and Lt. Col. Michael E. Fossum checked their spacesuits to prepare for Wednesday's spacewalk, in which they will enter the shuttle's cargo bay and test materials that might be used to repair damage to the hard, black material that protects the nose and wing leading edges from the hottest heat of re-entry. A case in the bay contains samples of this composite material, called reinforced carbon carbon, and an assortment of plugs and special putty that might be used to seal small cracks and abrasions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Columbia was destroyed on Feb. 1, 2003, while returning from a mission because of damage to this material on a wing caused by pieces of insulating foam that fell from the shuttle's external fuel tank and struck it during launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers are also expected to test a special infrared camera to see if it can pick up small cracks in the reinforced carbon carbon that be invisible to the human eye. It is hoped that the heat-detecting camera can find distortions in surface temperature that could indicate cracks that might need to be sealed or smoothed with a repair material.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Columbia disaster, NASA has been testing experimental methods that might be used in space to repair minor damage to a shuttle's heat shield, if found. Major damage would require abandoning the shuttle while the crew took refuge in the space station for later rescue.  </p>
