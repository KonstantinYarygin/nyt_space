<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE skies could get crowded in 2007. This time around it's not just a space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. New countries, and some rich people, will make it more of a space roller derby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expect developments from China, which has planned an orbital flight and spacewalk for 2007, and India, which has scheduled an unmanned lunar mission for next year. Both nations are hungry for the kind of international science cred that comes with being a spacefaring nation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are heating up even more on the private side of the space game. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has said it will be testing vehicles in 2007 that eventually will take well-heeled tourists to suborbital space. So will Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, at the West Texas launch site of his secretive company, Blue Origin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lesser-known companies like XCOR Aerospace, Aera Corp, Armadillo Aerospace, PlanetSpace and Rocketplane-Kistler are also hustling to get vehicles up and running. Robert Bigelow, the founder of Budget Suites of America, is likely to push forward with his goal of putting a hotel in orbit by 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At NASA, the year will be devoted to a series of complex shuttle missions to continue building the International Space Station, which the Bush administration has aimed to complete by 2010, the same year the shuttle program will be wound down. For most people, the 2007 missions are likely to seem like more of the same: construction, wiring and the kind of handyman work that are giving NASA TV ( www.nasa.gov/ntv [http://www.nasa.gov/ntv]) the feel of an orbital ''Tool Time.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John E. Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, an organization that monitors defense and space operations, said, ''The paradox of the space program has been to make extraordinarily difficult things look easy, and to make really exciting things boring.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID S. CLOUD  </div><div>706 words</div><div>30 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 -- The Pentagon is seeking nearly $100 billion for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, a request that, if approved by Congress, would set an annual record for war-related spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $99.7 billion request, detailed in a 17-page internal Defense Department memorandum dated Dec. 7, would be in addition to $70 billion appropriated in September. The request would push the total for the 2007 fiscal year to nearly $170 billion, 45 percent more than Congress provided for 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The request is likely to receive more scrutiny from Congress next year than previous supplemental spending bills, in part because Democrats now control both the House and Senate. Another reason for the scrutiny is that Pentagon officials encouraged the services to ask for ''costs related to the longer war against terror,'' not just continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a memorandum that became public earlier this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $50 billion -- most of the money -- would go to the Army, which is conducting the bulk of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The request also includes $3.8 billion for the Air Force and $3 billion for the Navy to buy or upgrade aircraft. Both services have argued in recent months that they need to replace planes used in combat operations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts questioned whether the services were exploiting the must-pass nature of the supplemental bill to seek money for other purposes like the modernization of aircraft rather than just wartime replacements. Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute, a policy analysis organization in Virginia, pointed to the Air Force request for $62 million for ballistic missiles, a weapon not being employed in Iraq or Afghanistan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson said the request, which is not described further in the memorandum, may be part of a continuing Air Force project to arm ballistic missiles with conventional warheads to be able to strike terrorist targets quickly if other weapons cannot be used.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, he added, ''there are a number of weapons systems in the supplemental request not normally associated with fighting terrorists but which the services say still should be covered as part of the global effort.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, the four military services would receive $26.6 billion for ''reconstitution,'' a term that the memorandum said covered repair and replacement of equipment damaged in Iraq and Afghanistan. Along with the $50 billion already provided this year, that is more than double what Congress appropriated in 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a real question about how much of this is really related to the war,'' said Steve Kosiak, a defense budget expert with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington policy analysis group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon is also seeking $9.7 billion for training Iraqi and Afghan security forces, almost as much as has been spent in total since 2001, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service. In a reflection of the worsening security situation in Afghanistan, more than half of the requested money would go to training the country's army and police forces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The request also underscores the continuing strain that deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan are putting on ground forces. The request includes $3.7 billion to speed up its outfitting and training of two Army combat brigades and three Marine battalions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2001, Congress has approved $507 billion for Afghanistan, Iraq and other operations deemed part of combating terrorism. Even with the Democrats in control, there is unlikely to be much appetite for cutting the war-related spending requests, Mr. Kosiak said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one seems to be saying we're going to make deep cuts in war-related expenditures,'' he said. ''I don't see evidence that the Democrats are interested in cutting this.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the incoming Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees have said they will push the Bush administration to finance war costs in regular appropriations bills, not in supplemental spending measures, to make the costs clearer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The request also includes $10 billion for protective equipment for troops and $2.5 billion for technology to defeat improvised bombs, the leading cause of American combat casualties in Iraq.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THESE are very good times for military contractors. Profits are up, their stocks are rising and Pentagon spending is reaching record levels. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only cloud might seem to be what the Democratic takeover of Congress could mean for their business. After all, this is an industry that has generally supported the Republican Party by sending about 60 percent of its political contributions to Republican candidates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, even so, few in the military industry are worried. Next year's Pentagon budget is expected to exceed $560 billion, including spending for Iraq. And, sometime this spring, President Bush has indicated he will seek an additional $100 billion in supplemental spending in 2007 for Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And no one expects Democrats, in the last two years of the Bush administration, to make major changes, especially with the war continuing. Democrats are sensitive to the charge of being ''soft'' on defense, and are expected to use their control of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to establish their military bona fides for the 2008 presidential election. This would include Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who is an increasingly vocal member of the committee. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't look for Democrats to make cuts in the defense budget,'' said Michael O'Hanlan, a military expert at the Brookings Institution. ''You didn't hear a lot about the defense budget in the last campaign and the Democrats know that you don't mess with the top line.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the industry can expect some harsh scrutiny. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has lead the efforts to tighten oversight of military contractors and programs, moves up to become the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He promises to keep up his relentless criticism of how the Pentagon spends its billions -- he has already written the incoming secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, to lay out some of his complaints. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the House side, the incoming Democratic chairman, Ike Skelton of Missouri, has said he wants to resurrect the committee's investigations and oversight subcommittee, which the Republicans disbanded in 1995. And he wants to hold hearings on missile defense and other space-based weapons systems that many Democrats have questioned. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Democrats and Senator McCain may cause individual companies some pain through attacks on specific programs and weapons systems, the billions that have been supporting the industry are expected to continue unabated, and perhaps even increase. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the Democrats will be on good behavior as long as the war continues and we have 150,000 troops in Iraq,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Securities in Newport, R.I. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of the industry's good fortune is reflected in the stocks of major contractors over the last year. At the end of 2005, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the largest contractor, was trading around $62 a share. Now Lockheed is around $92 a share. Over the last year, Boeing, which holds the No. 2 position, saw its shares rise from about $66 a share to around almost $89 a share. Meanwhile, Raytheon stock has risen from around $39 a share to more than $53 a share in the last year and General Dynamics has gone from the high $50s a share to almost $74 a share over the same period. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We certainly don't foresee any change,'' said Thomas Jurkowsky, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin. ''You certainly cannot deny that there is a lot of uncertainty in the world -- North Korea, Iran, Iraq. The Democratic Congress will see the reality of the dangerous world we live in, and will make decisions accordingly.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats are typically loath to cut programs that could affect unionized workers. The fact that so many of the Pentagon's weapons are build by unionized work forces -- the backbone of the Democratic Party -- is another reason why Democrats are expected to keep the money flowing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unionized workers in defense plants are a natural constituency of the Democrats,'' said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va. ''There is not too much advantage for Democrats to attack weapons programs.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some programs are not expected to fare well. Among those considered vulnerable are large Air Force programs that are not directly related to the war in Iraq -- satellites, missile defense and tactical fighters, for example. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the incoming Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Carl Levin, has said it is a mistake to purchase more missiles until tests can determine whether the missile defense program works. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also worrisome to the industry is that the incoming Democrats -- specifically, Mr. Levin -- have indicated that they are supportive of efforts to more closely scrutinize contractors on the issues of mismanagement and cost overruns. In a postelection news conference, Mr. Levin expressed support for Mr. McCain's efforts and even listed industry oversight as one of his top priorities. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to put much more emphasis on the oversight process, to make sure that the American people are getting a proper return on their tax dollars and that Pentagon activities are lawful and transparent,'' Mr. Levin said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes as some of the most important and costly weapon systems the Pentagon is acquiring have fallen years behind in development and billions over budget -- grist for Congressional scrutiny, especially from Mr. McCain. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. McCain, even before stepping up to the No. 2 position on the committee, began to make his presence felt. Just this month, the Air Force, under pressure from Mr. McCain, announced it was rewriting some of the rules for a contest between Airbus and Boeing for a contract potentially valued at $200 billion to build a new fleet of aerial tankers, which allow military planes to be refueled in midair. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain's past scrutiny of this contract led to the jailing of two top Boeing executives and the early retirement of an Air Force secretary. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain wrote Mr. Gates, the incoming defense secretary, to complain about a lack of open competition in the tanker bidding process, which led to rewriting of the bidding rules. The tanker program would be a record order of commercial jets -- the Air Force plans to buy some 530 commercial jets over the next three decades and adapt them for use as flying gas stations. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain would have wielded even greater influence had he become chairman of the full Senate Armed Services Committee. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These contractors clearly are relieved,'' said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit that has been critical of Pentagon practices. ''These reforms won't be the No. 1 priority for the committee, but it will be an important priority.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globalization is tough to sell to average people. Economists can promote the very real benefits of a robustly growing world: when they sell more overseas, American businesses can employ more people. But what sticks in our minds is the television image of the father of three laid off when his factory moves offshore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is worth taking note, therefore, of a good-news trade story for an icon of American manufacturing. The Boeing 747 looked as if it was heading toward obsolescence in the difficult environment for air travel after Sept. 11, 2001. Fast-forward five years and the old bird is flying high. Boeing has received orders for 67 of the airplanes this year, the most for that model in a single year since 1990 and worth a total somewhere in the neighborhood of $16.75 billion. Of course, all of this benefits Boeing's shareholders, the American economy and the nearly 150,000 people Boeing employs in the United States.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the credit for this good news goes directly to globalization and trade. As Leslie Wayne reported in The Times, expanding global trade is a main reason for the aircraft's renewed success, with many of the orders coming for air freighters rather than passenger planes. While sweat socks and cheap plastic toys take the slow boat, high-end goods like computer chips and expensive perishables like seafood go by air. Hence the demand for 747s, and Boeing's -- and America's -- good fortune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to bear in mind just how much this country has benefited from free trade at a time when protectionist sentiment -- particularly of the China-bashing variety -- is growing. America's middle class is unquestionably suffering through an era of wage stagnation and job insecurity. That is an argument for a stronger safety net for workers cut loose in the upheaval of a changing economy, whether those changes are driven by technology or global competition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large part of the problem is the disposition of the spoils of globalization. While liberalized trade has meant faster growth, lower inflation and huge profits, the benefits in this country have gone disproportionately to the wealthy. The United States needs a more progressive tax system and the government must find a way to help businesses and individuals with out-of-control health care costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the World Bank's recent report, Global Economic Prospects, trade in goods and services will very likely more than triple by 2030. Over the same period, the global economy is expected to expand from $35 trillion in 2005 to $72 trillion -- ushering hundreds of millions around the world out of poverty and into the global middle class in the process. That would mean a lot more goods to make and sell -- and a lot more cargo and passengers for Boeing jets.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the liftoff of Discovery in July, the space shuttle program was back in business, more than three years after flights were suspended because of the Columbia disaster. Two more shuttle missions followed, construction of the International Space Station resumed and a newly ambitious NASA announced a goal of establishing a permanent base on the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, immigration policy became an election-year issue. Polls showed that most Americans wanted a reasonable solution to twin problems: how to control better the flow of immigrants into the country, and how to deal with the millions already here illegally. Congressional debate on the issues proved fruitless, except for a bill authorizing -- though not financing -- the building of a fence along part of the border with Mexico.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could it already have been five years since the attacks of 9/11? A lot has happened in the intervening years, but at ground zero in Lower Manhattan, in some ways it seemed as if time had stood still. While developers, architects and government leaders finally agreed on who would build what for whom, plans for a memorial at the site were reconsidered when the price tag neared a billion dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers had a grim reminder of that disaster when industrial buildings along the waterfront in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, burned to the ground in May. It was a 10-alarm fire, the largest mobilization of firefighters in the city since the 9/11 attacks. But no one was killed or injured.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the year drew to a close, it was the city's police officers, not the firefighters, who were in the spotlight. Five officers fired a total of 50 bullets at a car leaving a Queens strip club, killing a 23-year-old man hours before he was to be married, and wounding two others. Community leaders organized protests and demanded an investigation, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the circumstances of the shootings ''unacceptable.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Military reality finally broke through the Bush administration's ideological wall last week, with President Bush publicly acknowledging the need to increase the size of the overstretched Army and Marine Corps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger ground forces are an absolute necessity for the sort of battles America is likely to fight during the coming decades: extended clashes with ground-based insurgents rather than high-tech shootouts with rival superpowers. The president's belated recognition is welcome, though it comes only after significant damage has been done to the Army's morale, recruitment standards and fighting readiness. Given the time required to recruit and train the additional troops, the proposed increase will not make much difference in Iraq's current battles. But over time it will help make America more secure and better prepared to meet future crises.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need for more troops has for some time been obvious to Americans. They have heard from neighbors or from news reports of tours of duty involuntarily extended, second and even third deployments to Iraq, lowered recruiting standards and members of the National Guard and Reserves vowing to get out. That is the inevitable consequence of trying to squeeze out an additional 160,000 soldiers for Iraq and Afghanistan year after year without significantly increasing overall ground forces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it took the departure of Donald Rumsfeld -- the author of the failed Iraq policy and the doctrine of going to war with less than the Army we needed -- for Mr. Bush finally to accept this reality.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no permanent right number for the size of American ground forces. The current size -- just over 500,000 for the active duty Army and 180,000 for the Marine Corps -- is based on military assessments at the end of the cold war. As the world changes, those assessments must be constantly reviewed. When the 21st century began, Pentagon planners expected that American forces could essentially coast unchallenged for a few decades, relying on superior air and sea power, while preparing for possible future military competition with an increasingly powerful China. That meant investing in the Air Force and Navy, not the Army and Marines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then 9/11 changed everything, except the Pentagon mind-set. During the Rumsfeld years, reality was subordinated to a dogma of ''transformation,'' which declared that with a little more technology, the Army could do a lot more fighting with fewer soldiers than its senior generals believed necessary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every year since 2001 has brought increased demands on America's slimmed-down and dollar-starved ground forces, while billions continued to flow into sustaining the oversized and underused Air Force and Navy, and modernizing their state-of-the-art equipment. As a result, the overall Pentagon budget is larger than it needs to be, while the part going to overtaxed ground forces is too small.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing those ground forces will cost roughly $1.5 billion a year for every 10,000 troops added, as well as tens of billions in one-time recruitment and equipment expenses. But America can afford it and it can be done without any significant increase in the annual military budget.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the estimated $15 billion a year (plus start-up costs) needed to add 100,000 more ground troops could easily be found by slashing military pork and spending on unneeded stealth fighters, stealth destroyers and attack submarines, and by trimming the active duty Air Force and Navy to better reflect current battlefield requirements.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, bigger ground forces will mean more sustainable troop rotations, fewer overseas deployments of the National Guard and better battlefield ratios of American to enemy fighters. That is the least America owes to the men and women who risk their lives to keep us all more secure.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By STEFANO S. COLEDAN and JOHN SCHWARTZ; Stefano S. Coledan reported from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and John Schwartz from New York. Andrew Pollack contributed reporting from Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. </div><div>957 words</div><div>23 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 22 -- The shuttle Discovery returned to Earth at 5:32 p.m. Friday in a gentle sunset landing at the Kennedy Space Center here. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wheels stop,'' said the shuttle commander, Mark L. Polansky, as the Discovery rolled to a stop on the 15,000-foot runway. After returning a greeting from mission managers, he said, ''It's going to be a great holiday.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the day -- which concluded a 13-day mission to rewire the International Space Station -- the astronauts were not sure where they were headed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers at mission control, at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, wrestled for days with the choice of a landing site. The weather rules are strict. There cannot be rain within 30 nautical miles of the runway, because of the risk of lightning and the damage that rain can cause to the shuttle's delicate thermal tiles at high speeds. Visibility has to be good so the commander and the pilot can see the runway, and winds must be at safe levels. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The favorite landing place is the Kennedy Space Center, where the shuttle fleet is maintained and readied for new missions. But clouds and rain at the runway violated NASA's rules for a safe landing at the first opportunity to prepare for a landing around 2 p.m., so managers had to take a close look at the two backup landing strips. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first, at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of California, has been the runway of choice for 50 of the 117 previous shuttle flights. It requires the shuttle to be brought back to Florida atop a specially fitted Boeing 747, which can add weeks to the turnaround time for its next mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final site, at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, has been used only once, in 1982. With little equipment on the site for maintaining the shuttle after it lands and preparing it for transport back to Florida, it was a distant third choice. It would have taken six weeks or more before the Discovery could have returned to Florida had it landed at White Sands. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High winds across the runway at Edwards took it out of the running for the first opportunity to order a landing there, around 4 p.m. Eastern time, and managers took another look at Florida, where weather conditions were improving somewhat. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4:20, mission managers gave the order to prepare for a landing at the Kennedy Space Center with a ''de-orbit burn,'' in which the shuttle fires its rockets to tip it out of orbit and back into the atmosphere. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Ham, an astronaut at mission control communicating with the shuttle crew, called up to say: ''Believe it or not, we're going to offer you a 'go' for the de-orbit burn. We're pretty confident we're going to keep you clear of clouds and rain.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission commanders had already told the astronauts to begin ''fluid loading,'' in which they would drink up to 32 ounces to replenish fluid lost from their body when they entered space. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery followed a re-entry path from the west-southwest, cutting across Mexico and West Texas and passing north of Houston and along the curve of the Gulf Coast. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was complex and ambitious. Spacewalking astronauts rewired the International Space Station so it could draw power from a new array of solar panels that was brought up on the previous mission of the shuttle Atlantis. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rewiring changed the main source of power for the orbiting laboratory, from a temporary configuration that used an old array atop the station; the new power network will allow the addition of more arrays, and the repositioning of the old array so the station will have the power it needs to support modules to be added in the next few years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission's first spacewalk involved adding a short truss to the station's structure. The rewiring required two spacewalks, in which half of the station's power was turned off. Both went smoothly. But things were not as simple in an effort to retract half of the old solar array. It had to be folded back into its container to make way for the new array, which rotates to face the Sun. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the array proved balky after six years of being extended and exposed to the harsh temperature extremes of space. The first effort to retract it by remote control got the panels folded up only about halfway. So mission managers ordered a fourth spacewalk, and two astronauts -- Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy and Christer Fuglesang of the European Space Agency -- poked, prodded and shook the arrays to help the process along. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That set a record for Captain Curbeam, who became the first American to take part in four spacewalks on a single mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission also delivered a new astronaut for the space station's three-member crew. Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy succeeded Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency, who rode back on the Discovery; she is to spend six months at the station. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA watched the weather in three time zones as it struggled to pick a landing site for the space shuttle Discovery. The agency plans to bring the ship home today. But showers were in the forecast at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and crosswinds were expected at the next-best option, Edwards Air Force Base in California. At the third-best choice, White Sands, N.M., the weather looked favorable, but that could change and New Mexico is considered inconvenient for transporting the shuttle back to Florida. NASA said that if one of the sites had favorable weather today, it would bring the shuttle home. The shuttle does not have enough fuel to remain in orbit beyond Saturday.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By IAN AUSTEN  </div><div>553 words</div><div>22 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA, Dec. 21 -- Onex, a Toronto-based investment company, expanded its presence in the aerospace business Thursday by joining with the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs to buy Raytheon's business jet division for about $3.3 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raytheon had put the unit under review in July as part of a program to focus on government and military aerospace, where profit margins are generally higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business jet unit, which is based in Wichita, Kan., and has about 8,500 employees, will be renamed Hawker Beechcraft, after two of the unit's venerable brand names.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unit is Onex's third significant aerospace investment. Last year, Onex acquired a component division of Boeing for $1.2 billion; part of it was sold off last month in an initial public offering worth $1.4 billion. Onex is also a minority member of the consortium that successfully bid for Qantas Airways earlier this month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all business jet makers, Raytheon's unit suffered as the market for its products dropped after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But the unit has returned to profitability in the last three years, posting earnings of $142 million in 2005, up from $63 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unit, which makes Hawker and Premier business jets and King Air turboprop planes, had revenue of $2.85 billion last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said that while the unit had made a strong comeback, it remained a laggard in its sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an elite club,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''They are the weakest of the big five.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among Hawker Beechcraft's largest rivals will be another Canadian-owned company, Bombardier, which is based in Montreal. The Teal Group ranks Bombardier as the market leader, with a 25 percent share compared with Raytheon's 10 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with the purchase of the Boeing unit, it appears that Onex will be entering the business jet market at the beginning of a growth period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an annual survey released in October, Honeywell estimated that shipments of business jets were up 26 percent in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2006, Honeywell estimates total shipments of 850 business aircraft, and for 2007 it forecasts 1,000 or more. Sales are still rebounding from 2003 lows in North America, and are rising in Asia and the Middle East.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Boeing operations acquired by Onex, Raytheon's business jet unit was an early user of resin-reinforced carbon fiber composites as substitutes for metals. But Mr. Aboulafia said that it was not clear if that would enable cooperation between the operations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the unit produces a training jet for the American military and Onex is not an American company, the acquisition is subject to Pentagon approval.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onex and Goldman Sachs will own equal shares of the company. Onex said in a statement that it would retain the business's current management, as it did with the Boeing unit.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore Airlines and Qantas of Australia have confirmed orders for a total of 17 A380 jets from Airbus, giving the European plane maker its first firm sales of the superjumbo jet in more than a year. The nine-plane deal for Singapore, initially announced in July, nearly doubles its initial purchase of 10 planes. Qantas, which already had 12 of the jets on order, confirmed a commitment for 8 more, Bloomberg News reported. The moves dispel months of speculation that the carriers might cancel orders as a result of manufacturing delays that have pushed back A380 deliveries. NICOLA CLARK  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ; Warren E. Leary contributed reporting.  </div><div>734 words</div><div>19 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two spacewalking astronauts used jury-rigged tools, ingenuity and muscle yesterday to coax balky solar panels to fold up into their containers on the International Space Station. The exacting effort took care of the major piece of unfinished business for this 12-day mission of the shuttle Discovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With innumerable starts, stops and tweaks, Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy and Christer Fuglesang, a Swede from the European Space Agency, helped a set of arrays, which when fully extended stretched about 115 feet, fold themselves like pleated blinds and fit back into the ''blanket boxes'' in which they made the trip to space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk began shortly after 2 p.m. Eastern time. The folding operation required the astronauts to move panels painstakingly along a frayed guide wire, to free up stuck grommets, pry panels apart and tug wires into the proper position and, occasionally, to grab the array structure and give it a good shake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was careful craftsmanship more than 200 miles above the Earth, and the astronauts used pliers and scrapers wrapped with tape to provide insulation against possible electric shock.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When, after five hours of work, the images from the astronauts' helmet cameras showed the folded panels sliding gently into their boxes, relieved applause broke out in the mission control room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Curbeam then announced that he had ''one little bad piece of news,'' saying that he noticed one guide wire that had not completely retracted, and was ''kind of looped over.'' He spent a half-hour examining, and finally tugging the wire into place so that it would not present a snag hazard or scrape the delicate glass panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 7:45, about five and a half hours after the spacewalk began, the automatic latches slipped into place to lock the boxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goal of the mission is rewiring the International Space Station so it can begin drawing power from a new solar array that was installed on the side of the station on the previous mission. The new array rotates like a paddlewheel to face the Sun continuously. That array's power replaces the balky solar array, which sat atop the station as a temporary power source.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To start rotating the new array, one-half of the old array had to be retracted; if not, the new arrays would strike it. The NASA plan was to retract one-half of the array completely on this mission and to retract the other half on a mission next March. After it was locked back in its boxes, the array could be moved on a later mission to a new position on the side of the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers had hoped that the array would retract without hands-on help, as it was designed to do. But the array had stayed extended in its temporary position for six years, far longer than the original station construction plans called for. NASA officials said going into the mission that they were worried that the panels would not properly retract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partial retraction last week did provide the clearance that was needed to start up the rotating array and allowed the astronauts to conduct the two spacewalks that successfully rewired the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission managers still hoped to retract the array before the repair crew, especially the highly experienced Captain Curbeam, headed home. And so managers added a fourth spacewalk. Captain Curbeam, by leading all four, set a NASA record for the most spacewalks by an astronaut in a single mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery will return to Earth as early as Friday just before 4 p.m. Eastern time. Before then astronauts will conduct a final inspection of the shuttle's delicate external tiles and panels to see whether any damage occurred on the flight from orbital debris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an evening news conference, Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy space station program manager, said the fourth spacewalk was especially risky, since most spacewalks are planned and practiced for years. This one came together in a couple of days, he noted, with improvised tools and an array that ''was not intended to be touched with tools or hands.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Diversification Over, BCE of Canada Will Sell Satellite Unit   </span>
</div><div class="author">By IAN AUSTEN   </div><div>486 words</div><div>19 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA, Dec. 18 -- In a final step toward concentrating on its Bell Canada telephone business, BCE Inc. said on Monday that it would sell its Telesat Canada satellite communications division to Loral Space and Communications and a Canadian pension fund.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale price of 3.25 billion Canadian dollars ($2.8 billion) was about 600 million to 1 billion Canadian dollars more than analysts' estimates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bell came out of this with a big, big valuation upside,'' said Dvai Ghose, a telecommunications analyst in Toronto with Genuity Capital.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Telesat sale represents the end of a long process by BCE, which is based in Montreal, to withdraw from a diversification program it embraced early in the decade. About a year ago, the company also sold its controlling stake in Bell Globemedia, a company that includes Canada's largest private television broadcaster, CTV, as well as The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher-than-expected price for Telesat will also help offset recent turmoil for BCE's share price brought on by a change in Canada's tax laws. In October, BCE said it would become an income trust, a corporate structure that would allow it to avoid most taxes by paying out the bulk of its income directly to shareholders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of Canada's largest telecommunications company becoming a trust, however, was too much for the federal government. It announced rules that effectively block new conversions and that limit the life span of current income trusts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, BCE, unsurprisingly, abandoned its conversion plans. It will eliminate the BCE holding company structure and adopt Bell Canada's name for all the company's operations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participation of the Public Sector Pension Investment Board in the deal appears partly intended to circumvent Canadian rules banning foreign control of satellite services and telecommunications ventures. The board manages funds for federal public servants and members of the military.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Loral, based in New York, will own 64 percent of Telesat's total equity, the pension fund, along with some minority Canadian shareholders, will own 66.7 percent of the company's voting shares. Mr. Ghose said he expected Loral to take full voting control of the company if Canada changed its ownership rules. The current Conservative government has hinted that such changes are coming.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telesat, which was once owned by the federal government and launched the world's first domestic commercial communications satellite in 1972, will remain based in Ottawa. Loral plans to transfer 4 of its Telstar satellites to give Telesat a total of 11; Telesat operates another 7 satellites for customers. It will also control four others that are scheduled to become operational over the next three years. That will make Telesat the fourth-largest satellite service provider in the world, based on the number of satellites it controls.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 18 -- Google Earth, meet Google Moon and Google Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA Ames Research Center and Google announced Monday that they had signed a formal agreement to collaborate on a broad set of projects that could include virtual flyovers of the Moon and Mars, and other initiatives that will make NASA's vast trove of space and weather data widely available on the Internet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is going to bring the excitement of space travel'' to a wider audience, said S. Pete Worden, director of the Ames Research Center, near Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Worden said that as the space agency pursued new manned space missions, the technology-sharing agreement might enable people everywhere to feel the crunch of an astronaut's step as he walked on the surface of the Moon or even Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collaboration may also allow the public to track space shuttle flights or the International Space Station in real time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signing of a Space Act Agreement formalizes a planned collaboration announced in September 2005. Still, Google and NASA spoke of possible joint projects only in broad outlines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them was the possibility that, using data from NASA, Google will develop products that work like Google Earth for the Moon and other planets. Google Earth is a software program allowing users to view a three-dimensional image of the world and then zoom in to specific areas for close-up views.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently Google offers limited two-dimensional views of the moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is already known for offering compelling images from space on its Web site, said Chris C. Kemp, director of business development at Ames. The agreement with Google will allow a great expansion of the agency's offerings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kemp said the agency had already worked with several private-sector companies and was eager to work with more. ''Part of the message here is that we are open for business,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Google nor NASA would comment on specific terms of the agreement. But Mr. Worden said NASA had funds to make some data and images available to the public. Google may finance specific projects to make additional data broadly accessible and integrated into its services, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Google and NASA first announced their planned collaboration, Google said it planned to build as much as a million square feet of space at Ames Research Center. A Google executive said that project was still in preliminary planning stages.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 17 -- The space shuttle Discovery's seven astronauts prepared Sunday for an unplanned fourth spacewalk to force a stubborn, half-retracted solar array to fold up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's crew prepared spacesuits, relocated the station's robotic arm and mobile platform so they can be used during the spacewalk and moved cargo from the station to the shuttle for the trip home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, by Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. and Christer Fuglesang, was to start at 1:47 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. Managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hope that fixing the array problem will not take more than four and a half hours, but the spacewalkers will be equipped to stay longer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's return to Earth was pushed back a day to Friday because of the extra spacewalk. Because of supply limits, the astronauts need to return no later than Saturday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be the third spacewalk for Dr. Fuglesang since the shuttle Discovery's arrival at the International Space Station almost a week ago, and the fourth for Captain Curbeam, who will set a record for most spacewalks on a single shuttle mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the mission's three previous spacewalks, for which astronauts had several months' practice in a large swimming pool at Johnson Space Center, Monday's trip outside has been put together on the fly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a briefing on Sunday, the lead spacewalk officer, Tricia Mack, outlined a vague spacewalk plan, noting that adjustments might be made depending on how the spacewalk progressed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station's cranelike robotic arm will carry Captain Curbeam to areas of the array that need troubleshooting. Dr. Fuglesang will be floating near the base of the array and will have with him insulated tools to pass to Captain Curbeam. Based on what he sees firsthand, Captain Curbeam can flip or fan out some stuck grommets, the source of the array folding problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to send astronauts outside for a fourth time was made by NASA managers on Saturday in the middle of a spacewalk by Captain Curbeam and Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, in which they successfully finished rewiring the orbital outpost from a temporary power source to a permanent one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the astronauts finished their tasks ahead of schedule, flight controllers asked them to inspect the half-retracted solar array, which had generated power for the station's temporary system. The old array retracted halfway by remote control Wednesday before getting stuck, and since then, the space agency has tried a number of approaches to fix it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalking pair on Saturday pushed a box into which the accordion-like, 115-foot array folds. That managed to free some stuck grommets and enabled the astronauts in the space station to retract the array farther by remote control, but then more grommets became stuck.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA considered having the current station crew or the next shuttle crew fix the array after the shuttle Discovery leaves. But managers did not believe that the three-member station crew had enough astronauts for the job, and they wanted to gain experience in solving the problem because the next shuttle crew in March will be performing similar work on another array.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The holidays may be the season of giving, but Lockheed Martin has decided that it's also a good time to take certain things away. Sort of.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company, the world's biggest military contractor, said it would no longer pay its executives' annual fees at country or social clubs after Jan. 1. Nor will it pay for cars and drivers for personal use, tickets to sporting events and concerts, or financial advice and tax preparation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives hired after Jan. 1 will not be eligible for the ''postretirement'' death benefits promised to their predecessors, nor will they be reimbursed for initiation fees at country clubs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't worry. Lockheed Martin is not just putting coal in executives' stockings. In the filing, it said it would give raises to make up for the lost perks. The chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, will receive an extra $40,000, for example, while Robert B. Coutts, an executive vice president, will get $25,000. MICHELLE LEDER  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese engineer was charged in San Jose with stealing trade secrets from a Silicon Valley company that made military training software. The man, Xiaodong Sheldon Meng, 42, who has Canadian citizenship, was indicted on 36 felony counts, including the rare charge of economic espionage to benefit a foreign government. Prosecutors say Mr. Xiaodong stole the code for software made by the company, Quantum3D Inc., that is used to train military fighter pilots, and tried to sell it to the Royal Thai Air Force, the Royal Malaysian Air Force and a company with ties to China's military.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>806 words</div><div>15 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the midpoint of the 12-day mission of the shuttle Discovery, two astronauts took a complex six-hour spacewalk yesterday to rewire the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers, Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy and Christer Fuglesang of the European Space Agency, completed the tricky electrical work in just two hours and moved on to more mundane tasks before ending the spacewalk at 7:41 p.m., an hour ahead of schedule. They completed the first half of the rewiring, with a second spacewalk planned for Saturday to finish the job.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past six years, the station has been running on a temporary configuration of its power system, drawing electricity from an array of solar panels atop the station. The rewiring will bring the station to its permanent arrangement, drawing power from a new array that rotates to face the sun during orbit. That array was carried to the station on the shuttle Atlantis's flight in September; more arrays may be added later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work involved a fair amount of unplugging and plugging cables in the harsh environment of space. The power cables the astronauts handled were not live; half the power network was turned off for each spacewalk. Mission managers spent much of the morning turning off equipment that was not essential -- including half the lights in the orbiting laboratory -- so critical equipment could remain in operation, receiving power from the other half of the network.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 4:45 p.m., the rewiring was complete and Stephen Robinson, an astronaut at mission control who communicates with the crew in orbit, radioed with what he called ''good news from Houston.'' And then he corrected himself: ''It's not good news, it's great news.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The components of the power system that had been connected were functioning properly, and none of the equipment would need to be replaced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ex-cellent,'' Captain Curbeam responded, stretching the word with pleasure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, which included a moment of awed appreciation of the northern lights seen from above, came after a frustrating day on Wednesday, as astronauts tried to get the old solar array to fold back into its storage box to provide clearance for the new array to rotate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old array, which has been open for six years, stubbornly refused to retract all the way, developing kinks and jams as Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy ran the motorized unit to retract it with more than 50 stop-and-start operations. Commander Williams was able to get the array retracted by 40 percent of its length, which was enough to allow the new array free movement, so mission managers decided to move on to yesterday's spacewalk and try to fully retract the array later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers, who have been discussing options since Wednesday night, appear to be leaning toward adding a spacewalk before the end of this mission to try to coax the solar array panels back into their container by hand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier yesterday, as Captain Curbeam and Mr. Fuglesang prepared for their spacewalk, the video feed on NASA TV showed the shuttle team floating around the cabin, reveling in weightlessness as they performed their tasks. But the spacewalk itself was conducted without the usual live video for much of the spacewalk, because the site was too close to the antenna required for video transmission, and mission managers did not want to expose Captain Curbeam and Mr. Fuglesang to additional electromagnetic radiation from the antenna.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation from the sun has also been a concern on this mission. A solar flare on Wednesday caused what the National Weather Service Space Environment Center called a ''moderate solar radiation storm.'' The storm has affected some radio transmissions on Earth, and has led mission managers to order the shuttle and station crews to sleep in protected areas of their craft, where there is more shielding from radiation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the rewiring complete, mission controllers turned on the cooling system so the power grid equipment would not overheat. If a problem had developed with the pumps that circulate cooling ammonia through the power network, managers would have had to order the two spacewalkers to undo all of their previous electrical work and return to the old configuration until the pump problem could be resolved -- potentially in an additional spacewalk to replace one of the 1,500-pound pumps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 5:19 p.m., Mr. Robinson let the astronauts know that the pump, which had been on the station for four years without being used, kicked on without trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Excellent,'' Captain Curbeam said again.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A balky array of solar panels that stubbornly refused to fold back into their box threatened yesterday to derail the ambitious attempt by NASA to rewire the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day mission of the shuttle Discovery involves a complex and highly choreographed effort to alter the electrical system of the station from its current configuration, with power being drawn from a set of solar arrays atop the station, to a new arrangement that will draw power from an array that was taken up on the previous mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That new array will rotate like a paddlewheel so its panels continuously face the sun as the station orbits Earth. But the older solar panels block the rotation of the new one, so they must be retracted before the astronauts can proceed to the next steps of the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers hoped to get the 115-foot-long array to fold itself back into its original container. As a fallback, they said, it could be folded by 40 percent of its original length, which would get it out of the way of the new array with about 10 feet of clearance and allow the new one to rotate and for rewiring to proceed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation began just before 1:30 p.m. Eastern time and was to have been completed quickly. Instead, it stretched on through several orbits and hours of stop-and-start operations, with the panels shimmering golden and rippling in the sunlight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was a mix of tense and tedious. The astronauts were able to squeeze about 17 of the 31.5 sections, or bays, back into the box before hitting a snag. But mission managers pressed forward, since the array might eventually hinder station operations in its partly folded state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble was not unexpected; managers had fretted about being able to get an array to fold neatly after having been exposed to the harsh temperature extremes of space for so long. In briefings with reporters last month, John Curry, the lead flight director for the station during the mission, said the problem was like ''when you buy a map and it was originally all nice and compressed, and now we try to compress it back'' to its original form.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will be pleasantly surprised if that all works without a hitch,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday afternoon, mission managers could be seen on NASA television ( www.nasa.gov [http://www.nasa.gov]) discussing the issue intently, and the astronauts tried variation after variation to make the panels come together.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't get any joy on that last motion,'' the station commander, Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, said at one point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 6 p.m., Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, the astronaut who operated the motorized mast, was trying to retract the array a bit at a time, calling out ''Ready ready now'' before each movement, and ''Abort'' at the end of each. That incremental approach got them down to just fewer than 17 bays, ''well within the safety restrictions,'' said Kyle Herring, a NASA public affairs officer for the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As hopes of getting the array fully retracted faded, managers decided to leave it in its partly retracted state for the moment so they could start the rotating array and prepare for the scheduled spacewalk today to carry out the rewiring process.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS, Dec. 12 -- The French police searched the Paris headquarters of European Aeronautic Defense and Space and its French shareholder Lagardere on Tuesday in connection with an insider-trading investigation involving managers at EADS, the parent company of Airbus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The raids overshadowed the news that European and American regulators had issued a long-awaited safety certificate for the A380, Airbus's twin-deck jet, which has been troubled by manufacturing delays.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for EADS and Lagardere, which owns 15 percent of EADS, confirmed the searches but declined to provide details.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation seeks to determine whether managers at EADS, including a former co-chief executive, Noel Forgeard of France, had inside information when they sold stock in March as EADS shares were near a record high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inquiry follows a complaint filed in June by a group of French shareholders, which asserts that Mr. Forgeard and three other EADS directors made more than 7 million euros ($9.2 million) by exercising options weeks before an April 5 announcement that two large shareholders -- DaimlerChrysler and Lagardere -- would each sell 7.5 percent stakes in EADS.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A French shareholder association, Appac, asked prosecutors last month to widen the investigation to include top executives at DaimlerChrysler, which is based in Germany, and Lagardere. The group asserted that the managers would have known about delays to the A380 that were not made public until June 13.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small shareholders were left in the dark and lost their savings,'' the president of Appac, Didier Cornardeau, said recently.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EADS shares have fallen 30 percent since reaching a peak of 35.13 euros on March 24 -- a loss of almost 9 billion euros in market value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, Thomas Froehlich, said that he was aware of the accusations but that so far the company had not been contacted by French investigators. He denied any wrongdoing by the company's management.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After checking all EADS board meeting minutes,'' Mr. Froehlich said, ''our lawyers have confirmed that at no point in time did our management have any information about further delays to the A380 program.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calls to Mr. Forgeard, who resigned his EADS post in July amid the insider-trading accusations, and his lawyer were not returned. Mr. Forgeard has denied wrongdoing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French and German market regulators are conducting separate investigations into irregular trading activity from March 7 through March 19, when EADS employees were entitled to exercise options. EADS said in October that it was also conducting an investigation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents filed with the French market watchdog, the AMF, show that Mr. Forgeard exercised options worth 3 million euros on March 9 and sold 2.5 million euros worth of shares on March 15. Mr. Forgeard's children sold shares worth 4.2 million euros on March 17. Three EADS directors also sold shares around the same period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widening inquiry came as Airbus said the A380 had received airworthiness certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration, which means it can be registered and flown commercially in the European Union and the United States.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 11 -- Astronauts used the International Space Station's robotic arm on Monday to examine a spot on the shuttle Discovery's left wing where sensors detected a ''very low'' vibration, NASA officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks like something happened,'' said John P. Shannon, chairman of the mission management team, noting that the wing looked fine during an inspection earlier Monday. The sensor recorded a level of vibration not considered worrisome, Mr. Shannon said, but managers decided to take a closer look to be safe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had not determined the significance of the vibration, though they did not expect it to affect the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle delivered a two-ton, $11 million addition to the space station, using the robotic arms of the shuttle and the station. The addition will be attached to the station during a spacewalk on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, the shuttle's commander, Mark L. Polansky, closed in on the station at a tenth of a foot per second before latches automatically linked the spacecraft shortly before sunrise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Space shuttle Discovery arriving,'' Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, a space station resident, told Mission Control in Houston at 6:54 p.m. Eastern time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Televised images showed Capt. Robert L.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About an hour before docking, the Discovery did a slow back flip so the space station crew could photograph its belly for signs of liftoff damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has been especially alert to damage to the shuttle's heat shield since the Columbia disaster in 2003, which killed seven astronauts. Foam broke off the Columbia's fuel tank during liftoff and gashed a wing, allowing hot gases to penetrate the spacecraft during re-entry.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTGOMERY, Ala., Dec. 11 -- It has been part of the lore of America's first black fighter pilots since the end of World War II: the famed Tuskegee Airmen never lost a bomber to enemy fire.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, more than 60 years later, a leader of the group says he has uncovered records proving the claim is not accurate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Air Force records show that at least a few bombers escorted by the red-tailed fighters of the Tuskegee Airmen were shot down by enemy planes, the man, William F. Holton, historian of Tuskegee Airmen Inc., said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. And the group's losses may have been much greater, Mr. Holton said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his research, first reported on Sunday by The Montgomery Advertiser, showed that though the group's record was stellar, it was not perfect, as long believed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some surviving members of the group are offended by the findings of Mr. Holton and Daniel Haulman of the Air Force Historical Research Agency at Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base here, who came to the same conclusion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former Tuskegee airman, Carrol Woods of Montgomery, called their claims outrageous.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think they are trying to destroy our record,'' Mr. Woods, 87, told The Advertiser. ''What's the point now?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holton said his sole interest was in making sure that the group's history was as accurate as possible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., Lt. Gen. Russell Davis of the Air Force, who is retired, said he would no longer say in speeches that the group never lost a bomber under its escort ''until we can get this thing clarified.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tuskegee Airmen were the first group of black fighter pilots allowed into the Army Air Corps. The name came from the east Alabama town where they trained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With nearly 1,000 pilots and as many as 19,000 support personnel, including mechanics and nurses, the group was credited with shooting down more than 100 enemy aircraft and, for years, with never losing an American bomber under escort.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holton, who has been historian of the association for about a decade, said he began leafing through old mission reports after hearing a veteran complain that the airmen really did lose some bombers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haulman said the group's combat mission reports clearly showed that American bombers were lost while being escorted by the airmen in Europe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One mission report states that, on July 26, 1944: ''One B-24 seen spiraling out of formation in T/A after attack by E/A. No chutes seen to open.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T/A'' stands for target area, ''E/A'' for enemy aircraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second report, dated Aug. 31, 1944, praised the group commander, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., saying he ''so skillfully disposed his squadrons that in spite of the large number of enemy fighters, the bomber formation suffered only a few losses.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report said that on Sept. 12, 1944, ''10 Me-109s attacked the rear of the bomber formation from below and left one B-17 burning, with 6 chutes seen to open.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, Dec. 10 -- The space shuttle Discovery looks to be in good health so far, NASA managers said Sunday, although it will be at least two days before engineers can rule out any possible damage from the program's first night launching in four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far so good,'' said Tony Ceccacci, the lead flight director, as the shuttle's astronauts wrapped up an inspection of the heat shield, looking for any possible damage from liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As expected, small pieces of foam debris and ice fell off the shuttle's external fuel tank during its Saturday-night launching, but they did not appear to strike the spacecraft, said John Shannon, the deputy shuttle program manager and chairman of the mission management team.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Discovery was launched in the dark, technicians from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration were not able to capture the same sharp photos as they did in the last three launchings. Still, they were able to take some images from the illumination of the solid rocket boosters and engines in the first few minutes of flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sweep of the shuttle, using the robotic arm, looked for damage from foam, a procedure made mandatory after the Columbia accident of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers worked on problems with a system that cools the shuttle's radiators, a predicament that surfaced during Discovery's flight in July, and on a latching mechanism on the shuttle's robotic arm that would not operate automatically. Neither problem was expected to affect the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crew members, meanwhile, checked the spacesuits that will be used for the 12-day mission's three spacewalks at the International Space Station. The first walk will involve installing an $11 million addition to the station, and the othersrewiring the station from its temporary power system to a permanent one. The rendevous with the station is scheduled for Monday afternoon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's crew will bring home one of the station's three crew members, Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut. Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, an American astronaut, will replace Mr. Reiter.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>958 words</div><div>10 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 9 -- Night became day on Saturday as the shuttle Discovery muscled its way off of the launching pad with a shuddering roar on a mission to rewire the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a blinding streak of yellow flame that left a mark on the retina and a lump in the throat, the shuttle and its crew of seven astronauts lifted off at 8:47 p.m. in the program's first nighttime launching in more than four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second launching attempt for the Discovery. Weather concerns forced mission managers to scrub on Thursday, and on Friday the forecast was even worse. Early Saturday, there were high crosswinds here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center landing strip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the winds died and the weather improved as the evening progressed, and the mission management team ultimately gave approval for launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before beginning the final countdown, the shuttle launching director, Michael D. Leinbach, polled his team and then called to the Discovery's commander, Mark L. Polansky, using his nickname.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''O.K., Roman, 48 hours makes a tremendous difference,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''The weather is outstanding, the vehicle is in great shape, so we wish you all good luck, Godspeed, and we'll see you back here in 12 days.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After liftoff, the firing room erupted in cheers and applause, and Mr. Leinbach said, ''Calm down now, we've got eight minutes to orbit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those eight minutes passed with exceeding smoothness. The crew and the launching team calmly communicated the milestones of reaching orbit: the ''go at throttle up'' call about a minute into flight as the shuttle passed through the zone of maximum turbulence; the separation of the solid rocket boosters; the main engine cutoff; and the separation of the external tank. Discovery was well on its way to catching up with the space station on Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, liftoffs have taken place during the day so NASA analysts can look for the kind of liftoff debris that doomed that shuttle and its crew. This nighttime launching made it harder to make out any debris in the images from the camera on the shuttle's external fuel tank, but those images and data from radar and other sensors will be scrutinized for signs of damage to the craft. ''We'll have lots of looks at it,'' said LeRoy Cain, the head of the launching mission management team.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day mission promises to be one of the most complex in the history of the shuttle program. The astronauts are to install a stubby extension to the station's structure and reconfigure its electrical system to receive power from new solar arrays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission also includes a tricky effort to coax a solar array that has been standing atop the station for six years to fold itself into a more compact form, out of the way so that the new array can rotate to face the sun continuously.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work will prepare the station to generate the power it will need for the next rounds of construction and expansion, and to meet the needs of a crew that will eventually double to six from three. Spacewalkers will unplug and reattach 112 power connectors in the process.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rewiring is risky. Half of the space station's electrical system will be powered down as its wiring is reconfigured, and then brought up again. Then, in another spacewalk, the astronauts will shut down the other half of the station's electrical system. Crucial systems will remain online, since they can receive power from either power network. But some lights, communications systems and other components will be turned off during each of the two rewiring spacewalks, and mission managers have fretted about what might happen if those do not come back online.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, after the power procedure is complete, the astronauts must start cooling pumps that will control the temperature of the circuit control boxes. The pumps have not been used in four years, and that, too, has managers sweating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two members of the Discovery's crew -- Commander Polansky, a former Air Force test pilot, and Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy -- have been to space before. The rest of the crew members will be taking their first trip, including the pilot, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy; Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy; Nicholas J. M. Patrick; Joan E. Higginbotham; and Christer Fuglesang, the first Swedish astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Williams will remain on the space station for six-months, and Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency, who has been living on the station, will climb aboard the shuttle for his ride back to earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the post-liftoff briefing on Saturday night, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said the shuttle and the station were now part of a larger effort to return to the work of sending humans to explore the Moon and the planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to learn to live on other planetary surfaces,'' Mr. Griffin said, ''and use what we find there and bend it to our will -- just as the pilgrims did when they came to what is now New England.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is part of what it takes ''to become a space-faring nation,'' he said, adding that it is up to NASA to make that happen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes we stumble,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''Today, we didn't stumble.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Missile Defense System Is Taking Shape in Alaska  </span>
</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM YARDLEY  </div><div>974 words</div><div>10 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT GREELY, Alaska, Dec. 4 -- Snow fences help keep drifts from piling up on the missile silos. Heat-sensing security devices that monitor the edges of this 800-acre installation are sometimes set off by wayward moose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the soldiers here, members of the 3-year-old 49th Missile Defense Battalion of the Alaska National Guard, were just selected to help field test for the Army the third generation of the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System, seven layers of synthetic meant to resist the brutal winds that rip past the snow-clad peaks of the Alaska Range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years after President Bush ordered a limited missile defense system to be built and nearly a quarter century after Ronald Reagan first proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative, this sub-Arctic outpost, once a cold war training site and still a cold-weather training site, is where progress on the long-embattled missile system is perhaps most evident, military officials say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven interceptor missiles are installed in underground silos here, buried beneath the snow and a former forest of black spruce. This summer, when North Korea signaled that it planned to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile, Fort Greely, which has never fired a test missile, was put on alert status, ostensibly ready to respond if necessary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the test either failed or was aborted, ''there was a little bit of a letdown'' at the base, said Lt. Col Edward E. Hildreth III, commander of the 49th, ''because we were prepared.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That assertion, echoed by other commanders at Fort Greely during a limited tour of the base this week, comes a little more than three months after Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld visited Fort Greely and expressed caution about the program's readiness. Critics have noted that tests on some parts of the system have failed and a recent successful missile test -- in California, shortly after Mr. Rumsfeld's visit to Fort Greely -- lacked decoys and was unrealistic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as questions persist about capability, the missile defense program is pushing forward at a cost of at least $9 billion a year. About a third of that goes to the kind of operation that is based at Fort Greely, called Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, which is intended to shoot down enemy missiles while they travel through space. Vandenberg Air Force Base in California also houses two interceptors, but military experts say Fort Greely is better situated to interrupt the likely flight path of a missile from Asia or the Middle East.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few years after being shut down, Fort Greely, about 100 miles southeast of Fairbanks, is now the destination of about 1,700 people, including some 200 soldiers, and the rest defense contractors and family members. The base's Brownie troop is at 16 girls and growing -- Monday night they made root beer floats -- just as the number of interceptors installed at the base is expected to expand to as many as 38.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in a region with barely four hours of daylight in December, there is a new espresso shop on base and an expanded PX that sells flat-screen televisions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sgt. Jack W. Carlson III, an intelligence analyst, said he was assigned to Fort Greely before the Pentagon officials created the 49th Missile Defense Battalion. ''We didn't have a name,'' Sergeant Carlson said. ''We didn't have patches. We just called ourselves G.M.D.,'' for Ground-Based Midcourse Defense.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sergeant Carlson married another soldier and has bought a house in nearby Delta Junction, population 840. He said he heated his house mostly with wood salvaged from the spruce left after a wildfire.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Fort Greely, he had been stationed in the Virgin Islands. He learned of openings in the missile defense program through an online posting, he said. ''I'd been on the beach all my life, and it was time to see the snow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaska has been crucial to American military interests since long before it became a state in 1959. Now, Adak, in the Aleutian Islands, is scheduled to become the home port of the Sea-Based X-band Radar, a long-delayed system built on a converted oil rig that is critical to the ground-based system's ability to track enemy missiles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the 49th is an Alaska National Guard unit, Colonel Hildreth reports to Col. Michael L. Yowell, commander of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade, based in Colorado.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Hildreth said he was well aware of criticism that missile defense was far from a perfected program. He said Fort Greely operated in a balance between operational mode and construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We build a little, test a little,'' he said. ''It's fluid.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 12th interceptor will be installed this month. Last summer, however, when American intelligence learned that North Korea might be preparing to launch an intercontinental missile, much of the bustle of contractors on the site stopped. Fort Greely went on alert. The system that had struggled through tests faced the possibility of firing a live missile.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It got quiet,'' said Col. Thomas M. Besch, director of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense for the Missile Defense Agency. ''And all of a sudden no developmental activity occurred. You could feel in the atmosphere that people were on edge and ready. You were kind of waiting for something to happen, and it didn't.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SULAIMANIYA, Iraq, Dec. 8 -- The Kurdish security contractor placed the black plastic box on the table. Inside was a new Glock 19, one of the 9-millimeter pistols that the United States issued by the tens of thousands to the Iraqi Army and police.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This pistol was no longer in the custody of the Iraqi Army or police. It had been stolen or sold, and it found its way to an open-air grocery stand that does a lively black-market business in police and infantry arms. The contractor bought it there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He displayed other purchases, including a short-barreled Kalashnikov assault rifle with a collapsible stock that makes it easy to conceal under a coat or fire from a car. ''I bought this for $450 last year,'' he said of the rifle. ''Now it costs $650. The prices keep going up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for this American-issued pistol and the ubiquitous assault rifle illustrated how fear, mismanagement and malfeasance are shaping the small-arms market in Iraq.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weapon prices are soaring along with an expanding sectarian war, as more buyers push prices several times higher than those that existed at the time of the American-led invasion nearly four years ago. Rising prices, in turn, have encouraged an insidious form of Iraqi corruption -- the migration of army and police weapons from Iraqi state armories to black-market sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All manner of infantry arms, from rocket-propelled grenade launchers to weathered and dented Kalashnikovs, have circulated within Iraq for decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But three types of American-issued weapons are now readily visible in shops and bazaars here as well: Glock and Walther 9-millimeter pistols, and pristine, unused Kalashnikovs from post-Soviet Eastern European countries. These are three of the principal types of the 370,000 weapons purchased by the United States for Iraq's security forces, a program that was criticized by a special inspector general this fall for, among other things, failing to properly account for the arms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weapons are easy to find, resting among others in the semihidden street markets here, where weapons are sold in tea houses, the back rooms of grocery kiosks, cosmetics stores and rug shops, or from the trunks of cars. Proprietors show samples for immediate purchase and offer to take orders -- 10 guns can be had in two hours, they say, and 100 or more the next day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every type of gun that the Americans give comes to the market,'' said Brig. Hassan Nouri, chief of the political investigations bureau for the Sulaimaniya district. ''They go from the U.S. Army to the Iraqi Army to the smugglers. I have captured many of these guns that the terrorists bought.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forces propelling the trade can be seen in the price fluctuations of the country's most abundant firearm, the Kalashnikov.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2003, a Kalashnikov in northern Iraq typically cost from $75 to $150, depending on its condition, origin and style. Immediately after the invasion, as fleeing soldiers abandoned their rifles and armories were looted, prices fell, pushed down by a glut and a brief sense of optimism.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the same weapons typically cost $210 to $650, according to interviews with seven arms dealers, two senior Kurdish security officials and several customers. In other areas of Iraq, prices have climbed as high as $800, according to Phillip Killicoat, a researcher who has been assembling data on Kalashnikov prices worldwide for the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based organization.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price ranges reflect not only a weapon's condition but its model. A Kalashnikov made in a former Soviet-bloc factory costs more than a Kalashnikov made in China, North Korea or Iraq. Collapsible-stock models have become disproportionately expensive. The price ranges do not include the most compact Kalashnikovs, like those Osama bin Laden has been photographed with, which now have a collector's value in Iraq and can cost as much as $2,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, weapon prices provide a condensed history of Iraq's slide into chaos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices began moving upward in the summer of 2003 as several classes of customers entered the market together, Iraqi security officials and the arms dealers said. Western security contractors, Sunni insurgent groups, Shiite paramilitary units and criminals who were released from prison by Saddam Hussein before the war all sought the same weapons at once.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kalashnikov prices quickly reached $200, they said. Since late last year, prices have been moving up again, as sectarian war has spread. Militias have been growing at the same time that more civilians have been seeking weapons for self-defense -- twin demand pressures that pushed prices to new heights this fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now the Sunni want the weapons because they fear the Shia, and the Shia want the weapons because they fear the Sunni,'' said Brig. Sarkawt Hassan Jalal, the chief of security in the Sulaimaniya district. ''So prices go up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Killicoat put it another way. ''When households start entering the market, that's a free-for-all,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge is evident across a spectrum of arms. Pistol prices have nearly tripled since 2003. Western 9-millimeter pistols now sell for $1,100 to $1,800 in the bazaars of this city. Sniper rifles cost $1,100 to $2,000, the dealers said. In the West, similar pistols sell for $400 to $600.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arms dealers say that rising prices have led to more extensive pilfering from state armories, including the widespread theft of weapons the United States had issued to Iraq's police officers and soldiers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the south, if the Americans give the Iraqis weapons, the next day you can buy them here,'' said one dealer, who sold groceries in the front of his kiosk and offered weapons in the back. ''The Iraqi Army, the Iraqi police -- they all sell them right away.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No weapons were displayed when two visitors arrived. But when asked, the owner and a friend swiftly retrieved six pistols, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and three Kalashnikovs from a car and another room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rifles and the grenade launcher were wrapped in rice sacks. He slipped two of the rifles out of the cloth. They were spotless and unworn, inside and out, and appeared never to have been used. They had folding stocks and were priced at $560 each.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dealer said they had recently been taken from an Iraqi armory. ''Almost all of the weapons come from the Iraqi police and army,'' he said. ''They are our best suppliers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pistol was a new Walther P99, a 9-millimeter pistol that the dealer said had been issued by the Americans to the Iraqi police. It was still in its box.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glock pistols were also easy to find. One young Iraqi man, Rebwar Mustafa, showed a Glock 19 he had bought at the bazaar in Kirkuk last year for $900. Five of his friends have bought identical models, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked if he was surprised that the Iraqi police and soldiers sold their own guns, he scoffed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything goes to the bazaar,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''It is not only pistols. A lot of police cars are being sold. The smugglers brought us three cars and asked if we wanted to buy them. Their doors were still blue, and police labels were on them. The lights were still on top.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the scale of weapons sales is unmistakably large, it is impossible to measure precisely. Sales are almost always hidden and unrecorded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracing American-issued weapons back to Iraqi units that sell them is especially difficult because the United States did not register serial numbers for almost all of the 370,000 small arms purchased for Iraqi security forces, according to a report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weapons were paid for with $133 million from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. Among them were at least 138,000 new Glock pistols and at least 165,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles that had not previously been used, according to the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lt. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, agreed that weapons provided by the United States had slipped from custody.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I certainly concede that there are weapons that have been lost, stolen and misappropriated,'' General Dempsey said. He noted that the inspector general had estimated that 4 percent, or about 14,000 weapons, were lost between arriving in Iraq and being transferred to Iraqi forces. Most of the weapons were pistols.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general said that he thought the estimate was high and that accountability was improving. A weapons registry was being created, he said. ''Serial numbers are being registered,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the estimate of a 4 percent loss did not include weapons that were lost or stolen after being issued to Iraqi units. The arms dealers said this was the main source of their goods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arms dealers described several factors that kept weapons flowing from state custody.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have been taken by insurgents in ambushes or raids. Defections and resignations have also been common in Iraqi police and army units, they said, and often departing soldiers and officers leave with their weapons, which are worth more than several months of pay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Karp, a small-arms researcher at Old Dominion University, said Iraq resembled African countries that had had extraordinary difficulties with the police selling off their guns. ''The gun becomes the most valuable thing in the household,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If anything happens to a police officer's family and he needs money, he walks into work the next day and says, 'Hey, my gun got stolen.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another weapons dealer, who Kurdish officials said had been providing them with weapons since 1991, said the latest black-market sales followed an old pattern precisely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout Mr. Hussein's rule, Iraqi Army officers were in the arms trade, he said, selling weapons to smugglers. This was how the Kurdish guerrillas kept themselves supplied.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he said, the smugglers remain in business, and their trade is made easier because the units often do not have inventories. ''I am surprised sometimes by the numbers,'' he said. ''Sometimes they come by the hundreds.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an age of rogue regimes and pre-emptive war, states developing clandestine nuclear programs know better than to leave them in plain sight. Anxious to ward off an American or Israeli attack, Iran, for example, appears to have buried its uranium-enrichment halls under 30 feet of earth and concrete. No doubt, canny proliferators will soon dig even deeper and better-armored holes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if they dig deeper, we can always go higher: hence the call for the ''Rods From God.'' More properly known as hypervelocity rod bundles, these weapons would simply be slender solid tungsten cylinders, 20 or 30 feet long and one or two feet in diameter. The rods would be sent into space and fired from satellites at bunkers on the ground, which they would hit at speeds of more than 10,000 feet per second, penetrating deep into the earth without any explosives. The idea is far from new. Jerry Pournelle, a science-fiction writer and space-weapons expert, conceived it while working for Boeing in the late 1950s; he called the weapon Thor, and as he explained in an interview, ''People periodically rediscover it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists have observed serious limitations to the idea, beginning with the high cost of lifting heavy tungsten poles into orbit. The rods were nevertheless included among ''future system concepts'' in a recent Air Force ''Transformation Flight Plan,'' which envisioned their ''capability to strike ground targets anywhere in the world from space.'' Even if Thor will not be hurling tungsten thunderbolts at suspected bunkers in Iran any time soon, the military has accelerated its pursuit of space weaponry; one study of nonclassified budgets released earlier this year indicated that spending on space-weapons research has grown by more than a billion dollars each year since 2000, with an eye toward establishing uncontestable ''space superiority.'' In August, the Bush administration adopted a revised ''National Space Policy'' that rejects any arms-control agreements that might hinder ''freedom of action in space.'' JONATHAN SHAININ  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Phantom Sentinel takes flight, it looks like an awkward boomerang -- a set of three small blades. It spins in a circle, faster and faster as it ascends into the sky. Then, when it reaches about 50 feet, it whirls so fast that something remarkable happens: it vanishes right before your very eyes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sentinel is still there, but you can't see it. It is the world's first ''invisible spy drone,'' a new class of remote-controlled stealth aircraft. Driven by electric-engine propellers on two of its blades, the Sentinel also moves in virtual silence. ''You could fly it 75 feet above the Macy's parade, and nobody would know it was there at all,'' says Dean Tangren, president of VeraTech Aero Corporation, which received a patent for the invention this summer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phantom Sentinel works by putting the difficulty we have in perceiving rapidly spinning objects to use. Think of a helicopter: the body is immobile and thus visible, but the blades are moving so fast that the eye sees them as only a vague blur. Tangren's device works like a helicopter, except that the whole craft is nothing but the blades. Meanwhile, cameras mounted near the center of the Sentinel whirl in circular patterns, capturing a 360-degree panorama and broadcasting live video to the operators. A Sentinel can be folded up into a backpack and can fly for up to 40 minutes before its batteries need refueling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Military agencies have already contacted Tangren about using the Sentinel for spy surveillance. So have private-sector firms, including an oil company that envisioned using Phantom Sentinels to patrol its 5,000 miles of oil pipelines. If Osama bin Laden is ever caught by one of these drones, it would be a scene straight out of science fiction: the world's most reclusive terrorist, nabbed by a pair of invisible eyes.

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>857 words</div><div>9 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 8 -- NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, says the current period of space exploration will come to be seen as a mistake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Viewed from the point of history several decades out,'' he said in an interview, ''the period where the United States retreated from the Moon and quite deliberately focused only on low Earth orbit will be seen, to me, a mistake.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin has made similar comments before, notably a year ago in an interview with USA Today. This time, his remarks came as he waited for Thursday's down-to-the-wire effort to launch the shuttle on a 12-day mission to rewire the International Space Station. The liftoff was scrubbed at the last minute because of weather concerns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers decided not to try to launch on Friday, when weather conditions were predicted to be too cloudy and windy for a safe launching. They expect to try again at 8:47 p.m. on Saturday, though the decision about whether to proceed will not be made until weather officers give their prediction early that morning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching opportunities extend to Dec. 26, though space agency officials hope to get the shuttle to orbit long before then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin was appointed to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 2005, a year after President Bush announced his ''vision for space exploration,'' which calls for returning astronauts to the Moon by 2020 and then moving on to send humans to Mars. Mr. Griffin has from the start been an enthusiastic proponent of that plan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has put him in a delicate situation, as he has shifted NASA financing to the Moon initiative, while moving to complete the space station and shut down the shuttle program by 2010, and cutting back on its science activities. And in doing so, he has occasionally expressed doubts about the wisdom underlying the nation's decision to build the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his remarks a year ago, he issued an apologetic memorandum to NASA employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if there was any discomfort in expressing such opinions once again at the Kennedy Space Center in the midst of preparations for launching, Mr. Griffin showed none. He said in the interview that his comments had been broadly misconstrued as a slap against the people who build and maintain the shuttle and space station, and emphasized that he admired the people of NASA who took on enormous challenges to create the shuttle and station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fault is not NASA's, he said, adding: ''The space shuttle is a response to a policy mistake -- it isn't the mistake. The mistake was tearing up all the infrastructure that we built for Apollo and saying, 'let's just focus on low Earth orbit.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan to return to the Moon by 2020 has been met with some skepticism, especially among those who doubt that the space agency can take on such a daunting project within its $17 billion annual budget. Dr. Griffin said that NASA could do the job -- and could reach the moon even more quickly, with more money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm tempted to say, 'Why the skepticism?' '' he said, adding, ''but in fairness, NASA's recent history has not had the on-time, on-budget performance characteristic of the Apollo era. And I'm trying to restore that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that Democrats won the majority of seats in Congress in the November election, and other political changes that will occur over time, should have little effect on the plan, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless you believe that a future U.S. president or a future U.S. Congress actually wants to cancel the U.S. spaceflight program, then I actually do not perceive a big threat from changing administrations and changing Congresses,'' he said. ''I think the country wants to have a manned spaceflight program, and a substantial one.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger D. Launius, the chairman of the division of space history at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, expressed surprise that Mr. Griffin would repeat his statement about the judgment of history after the controversy that erupted a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here we've got a guy who speaks his mind,'' Mr. Launius said. ''That's not always the case, certainly in Washington, and it certainly hasn't been the case at NASA.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while some of the criticism is justified, Mr. Launius said, the shuttle ''turned out better than it had any right to,'' and stands today as something of an engineering marvel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee and the incoming head of the House Committee on Science, declined to address Mr. Griffin's comments about the history of the space effort, saying through a spokeswoman: ''I would rather focus on where we go from here. I support human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. However, it's got to be paid for.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 7 -- NASA scrubbed the launching of the shuttle Discovery on a mission to the International Space Station on Thursday night at the last possible moment because of low clouds here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the clock ticking down toward the 9:35 blastoff time, Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, called the commander, Mark L. Polansky, using his nickname. ''O.K., Roman, we gave it our best shot,'' Mr. Leinbach said, and explained they could not assume the clouds would clear in time for launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mike, we understand, and thanks to the team for all their hard work,'' Mr. Polansky replied. ''Try not to be too disappointed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather has been a concern for the mission in recent days at Cape Canaveral and at three emergency landing sites in Europe. At the cape, low clouds and gusting winds exceeded NASA's limits for safe launching, with the probability that weather would cause a delay rising from 20 percent early in the week to 60 percent by Thursday. Mission managers have decided to forgo a launching attempt on Friday, when conditions are expected to be even worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers kept their launching hopes alive until minutes before 9:35 p.m., the scheduled blastoff time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On any given day, the launching window is very narrow -- usually about 10 minutes, and just five for Thursday -- as the Kennedy Space Center falls within the orbital plane of the space station. If conditions do not allow launching during the window, the opportunity for the entire day is lost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The span of days available to launch in December stretches until Dec. 26. Managers hope to get the crew off the ground by Dec. 17 for the 12-day mission, however, so that they can avoid a problem that has never arisen before: the shuttle's computer system was not designed to function over the change of a year. The computers would have to be reset on Jan. 1 -- something mission control is loath to try in space. But mission managers have said that it is possible to reset the computers in space and that the crew is trained to perform the operation. If time runs out, NASA may push ahead with the later launching, so long as the reset occurs while the shuttle is connected to the station in case anything goes wrong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if mission managers decide against trying the reset in space, they will have to postpone the beginning of the mission until January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Michael Griffin, the administrator of NASA, said he was not worried about getting Discovery off the ground. ''We've got many days in this window to launch,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''We're fine.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By SARITHA RAI  </div><div>446 words</div><div>8 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANGALORE, India, Dec. 7 -- Airbus, the European aircraft maker, said Thursday that it planned to invest $1 billion in India over the next decade to meet the vigorous demand in its travel market, the fastest-growing in the world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India would need passenger and freight aircraft valued at $105 billion to meet burgeoning demand by 2025, Airbus said in a market forecast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it would spend $300 million in setting up a pilot-training school and $250 million on an engineering unit, both likely to be situated in India's technology hub, Bangalore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is just the beginning, there will be much more,'' Kiran Rao, president of Airbus India, said at a news conference Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment is part of a $500 million commitment to the Indian government, which recently ordered 43 Airbus aircraft for Indian Airlines, the state-owned domestic carrier, in a $2.25 billion deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fierce global rivalry between the world's two leading aircraft makers, Airbus and its American competitor, Boeing, is escalating in the rapidly growing Indian market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For aircraft makers, the future lies in India and China,'' said G. R. Gopinath, managing director of Air Deccan, the first low-cost airline in India.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is being unleashed by deregulation of the airline sector, the emergence of several new airlines, low fares and the large untapped demand for air travel, John Leahy, the chief operating officer of Airbus, said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's civilian airline market is booming, with more than a half-dozen new airlines in the last couple of years offering more connections, cheaper flights and superior service. Several more are expected to start in the coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus has already sold about half the passenger planes that fly in India, the company said. On Wednesday, Boeing delivered 18 of the 68 jetliners ordered by the state-owned carrier Air India under an $11 billion contract, the largest commercial aircraft order in India's civil aviation history.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India would need 1,100 new planes, 935 of them passenger aircraft, according to Airbus's market forecast. That would be nearly five times the 190 passenger aircraft in service at the end of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus would seek to capture at least half the Indian market, the company said. Boeing forecast in August that India would need 856 new planes over the next two decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, an airline consulting group based in Sydney, has predicted that India's domestic air travel market will expand to 70 million passengers a year by 2010, about four times the current number.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After air traffic fell off sharply following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Boeing 747, the hump-backed giant of the skies, appeared to have run out of lives.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plane -- the first of which was flown in 1970 by Pan Am after being christened by the first lady, Pat Nixon -- was no longer in strong demand, as the world seemed to be moving to smaller, more fuel-efficient planes. And the new double-decker A380 from Airbus, Boeing's archrival, had captured the industry's imagination, even though it was years from being built.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 747 ''was on a heart-lung machine,'' Howard Rubel, an aviation analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company, recalled. ''It looked like Boeing was about to shut it down.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a funny thing happened to the 747 on the way to the graveyard: it found a new tailwind, and a strong one at that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is growing for the new 747-8 Intercontinental, which was introduced a year ago. Boeing now has 73 orders for the plane after its latest lift yesterday from Lufthansa, the big German carrier, which announced it was placing a $5.5 billion order for 20 747-8s, and took options to buy 20 more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's taken us time to evolve the plane,'' said Larry S. Dickenson, Boeing's vice president for sales, at a news conference yesterday. ''We think we have a winner.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This reversal of fortune comes as Airbus's superjumbo A380 has stumbled, falling two years behind its delivery schedule amid persistent wiring problems and a management shake-up at the company. While Boeing takes pains to say that the two planes are not head-to-head competitors, the industry generally sees them that way. They are the only two planes in the ''very large'' category: The 747-8 is designed to carry up to 467 passengers, while the A380 can carry up to 555.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In large part, the 747's new lease on life is owed to global trade. Until the Lufthansa deal was announced, all 747-8 orders had been for the freighter version of the plane. Even the initial orders for the latest model were for air freighters, an unusual move in an industry that likes to kick off new models with orders from high-profile passenger carriers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, technological advances, particularly next-generation fuel-efficient engines, improved the economics of operating a four-engine passenger plane like the 747.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new 747 is an inexpensive way for Boeing to capture some passenger orders, a lot of cargo orders and make a fair amount of money because of the Airbus 380 hiccup,'' said Jon B. Kutler, chief executive of Admiralty Partners, a private investment firm in Santa Monica, Calif., that specializes in aerospace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 747-8 is even being sold and outfitted by Boeing as a private jet much like Air Force One, which is a 747. Each plane carries a list price of about $275 million. Boeing will not identify the customers, but many in the aviation world say the orders are probably coming from people in the Middle East who are flush with oil riches. They are historically big buyers of Boeing jets for personal use.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, these events have not gone unnoticed at Airbus, which has lost some freighter orders for its A380 to Boeing in recent weeks. Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus North America, called the new 747-8 a brand-new Edsel, the famous new-car failure of the late 1950s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The 747 is on its last legs,'' Mr. McArtor said in an interview. ''It doesn't have any legs to stand on. Boeing is trying to breathe life into a 1960s-era design. There is only so much you can do with a plane.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''But it is irritating. Boeing is getting orders only because of our inability to meet demand. Had we not stumbled with the A380, there would not be orders like the Lufthansa order for the 747-8.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing executives, not surprisingly, have a different view of the plane. ''The 747 is a plane that is tough to beat,'' said Dan Mooney, Boeing's vice president for the 747 program. ''The 747 will do what our customers are looking forward to. We now have a plane that works for them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's 747, of course, is not the same as the one flown in the 1970s. The first version, the 747-100, featured a piano bar on the upper deck. Today's 747-8, which will be delivered in 2009, is longer, faster and will carry over 100 more passengers than earlier models.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mach 0.855, about 570 miles per hour, the 747-8 will be the fastest commercial plane in the sky. It can also fly 8,000 nautical miles nonstop, compared with 4,500 nautical miles for the original version. Boeing has produced a total of 1,379 747s to date and has a backlog of 91 orders   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The 747 has turned into the Energizer bunny of airplanes,'' said Byron Callan, an aviation analyst with Prudential Equities Securities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the plane fell into a steep decline in the last few years. Once Airbus announced in 2000 that it would build the A380, it created the industry buzz that the 747 once enjoyed. In 1990, Boeing had 122 orders for the plane. By 2003, it had only four.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Airbus announced the A380, Boeing looked flat-footed. For years, it appeared to dither about the future of the 747. It ordered up a number of 747-X studies of an advanced version of the plane, but came to no conclusion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dithering paid off. As time marched on, so did technology. And when Boeing shifted its emphasis into developing its new 787 Dreamliner, a wide-body midsize passenger plane, many of the technologies it pioneered for that plane could be adapted to the 747, including the fuel-efficient engines developed for the 787 and a new wing design that could stretch its flying range.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were challenged,'' said Mr. Mooney, head of Boeing's 747 program. ''We could stretch the plane, but not get range. We could get range, but not add capacity. The real breakthrough was the new 787 engines. That was the last piece of the puzzle allowing us to add additional seats as well as increase the flying range. That automatically allowed our customers to get more revenues from the plane.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more important to the longevity of the 747 was a design decision made in the 1960s, when the 747 was still on the drawing board.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the plane was envisioned as a passenger jet, it was also designed to be easily adapted to a freighter model. The first freighter -- complete with a nose that opened up for big cargo -- entered the market in 1972. But, at the time, there was scant interest in this type of craft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed in the late 1970s, when passenger demand hit a cyclical low and airlines found that the 747 was too big for their needs. In response, Boeing came up with the idea of helping airlines convert their 747s to freighters to sell them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The conversion program came out of necessity,'' said Ned Laird, managing director of the Air Cargo Management Group, a consulting firm and a former Boeing executive who worked on the conversion program. ''Freight companies that could not afford a new 747 could purchase a surplus 747 at a favorable price.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion program helped eliminate what otherwise would have been a glut of planes. At the moment, 747 freighters now dominate the air cargo market. Mr. Laird estimates that measured by ton-miles carried, the 747 represents about 60 percent of the freighter market, which has revenue of about $60 billion a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As manufacturing increasingly moves to Asia and worldwide commerce increases, the cargo market is growing at a faster rate than the passenger market -- about 6 percent a year, compared with passenger growth of about 4 percent, according to Air Cargo Management. (That said, the passenger market is about three times the size of the freighter market, with revenue of $185 billion last year.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, there are 481 747 freighters in use. This compares with 353 in 2000. While there are many smaller cargo planes -- and the combined total of all them exceeds the number of 747 freighters in the air -- the 747 is the only big cargo plane available and is the only plane that can be used for some large loads.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Boeing's big coups was to lure Federal Express away from a freighter version of the Airbus A380. Federal Express decided to go with Boeing -- it ordered 15 smaller Boeing 777s -- because of the delivery delays in the A380. Currently, Airbus has only one main customer, United Parcel Service, for its A380 freighter. .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing has high hopes that it may be able to peel away some passenger orders from Airbus, as well. Mr. Mooney, the 747 program manager, predicted that, over time, the bulk of 747-8s would be sold to passenger carriers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airlines have already hinted that more 747-8 passenger orders might be in the offing. Etihad Airlines, the national carrier for the United Arab Emirates and an A380 customer, said it might consider a 747-8.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, also an A380 customer, said last October that the airline was considering the 747-8. Another possible buyer is British Airways, whose chief executive, Willie Walsh, complained recently that the A380 is ''too big.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a matter of just a few years, the market positions of the A380 and the 747 have switched. The A380 has gone from being the plane of the future to the one in trouble. The 747, meanwhile, moved from being an also-ran to a real competitor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One would have never thought that Boeing could have gotten a lot of orders for the 747,'' said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I. ''But they will turn out enough to give Airbus some real heartburn with the A380.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''THE ENDURING 747''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing has delivered 1,379 of its 747 jumbo jets since 1969, and airlines still operate nearly 1,000 of them. Early customers liked the plane's ability to carry hundreds of passengers long distances; some versions featured an upper-deck lounge. But the plane was also designed to be easily adapted to a freighter model, with a nose that opens, an innovation that has proved popular among carriers.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 6 -- Low clouds related to a cold front have increased the likelihood that the scheduled launching of the shuttle Discovery on Thursday will have to be postponed at least a day, NASA said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately, the weather continues to deteriorate,'' said the shuttle launching weather officer, Katherine A. Winters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Winters put the likelihood of a postponement at 60 percent, up from 20 percent earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects are even worse for Friday, with a 70 percent chance of high winds and rain. Forecasters expect slight improvements by Saturday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On any given day, the launching window is extremely narrow, about 10 minutes, as the Kennedy Space Center falls within the orbital plane of the International Space Station. If conditions do not allow a launching in that window, the opportunity for the entire day is lost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather conditions have to be promising not only here, but also over at least one of the three sites, two in Spain and one in France, that NASA has chosen for emergency landings in case the shuttle cannot reach orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard M. Linnehan, an astronaut who has flown on the shuttle three times, said that weather was always a concern but that the percentages were not always decisive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You hear it's no-go for weather, and then I've seen them launch,'' Mr. Linnehan said, adding that sometimes the clouds have a chance break. ''Literally, a hole we can see comes through, and we can launch through it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the weather over the emergency sites, Mr. Linnehan noted that no such landing had been necessary but added that NASA had to be ready, anyway. He said, ''It's never going to happen -- until it happens.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>728 words</div><div>6 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 5 -- The space shuttle Discovery is to begin a complex 11-day round trip to the International Space Station as early as Thursday night, lighting up the skies in the first nighttime launching in four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the weather and technology cooperate, the shuttle and its crew of seven astronauts will be launched just before 9:36 p.m. The fiery blastoff should be visible along much of the Eastern Seaboard; weather permitting, even New Yorkers will be able to see it along the south-southwest horizon about seven minutes after liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will appear as a very bright, pulsating, fast-moving star, shining with a yellowish-orange glow,'' about as bright as Jupiter, which is often visible in city skies, said Joe Rao, an associate and guest lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium in New York, in an e-mail message.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No technical problems that would necessarily delay the mission have been announced, and the likelihood of favorable weather is 60 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an evening news briefing, NASA mission managers said that their teams continued to work through remaining issues leading up to the launching, including a power surge detected at the launching pad, said LeRoy Cain, NASA's launching integration director. Nonetheless, he added, "We're on track, and on target for Thursday."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last nighttime launching was in November 2002, two months before the ill-fated mission of the shuttle Columbia. Foam debris shed during the Columbia's liftoff punched a hole in a wing, allowing superheated gases to enter the craft and break it apart when it re-entered earth's atmosphere 16 days later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, shuttles have been launched in daylight so cameras can capture detailed images of any liftoff debris. Now, NASA managers say they are confident that they have learned enough from those images and that other sensors will provide them with any data they need.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two members of the Discovery's crew -- the commander, Mark L. Polansky, a former Air Force test pilot, and Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy -- have been to space before. It will be the first trip to space for the rest of the crew: Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy, the pilot; Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy; Nicholas J. M. Patrick; Joan E. Higginbotham; and Christer Fuglesang, the first Swedish astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle will leave Commander Williams on the space station for a six-month stay and bring Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency back to earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 20th mission to the station involves significant challenges, mission managers say. Astronauts will add a small structural truss to the orbiting laboratory and reconfigure the station's electrical system to begin drawing power from solar panels added on the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will have to retract a set of solar arrays that have been sitting atop the station for about six years so the new arrays can turn on their axis like a paddlewheel and continuously face the sun as the station orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers acknowledge that the panels may not automatically refurl into their holders. John Curry, the lead flight director for the station during this mission, used this analogy in a briefing last month: ''When you buy a map and it was originally all nice and compressed, and now we try to compress it back'' to its original form.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will be pleasantly surprised if that all works without a hitch,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If necessary, there are backup plans to retract the arrays manually.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers also fret over the complications involved in powering down half of the station at a time for the rewiring work; they say the question of whether everything will smoothly power up again is a nail-biter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course, the biggest concern is the one that never goes away. Commander Polansky said last month that the space agency had learned from the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a lot of confidence that the program has done everything they possibly can to make the vehicle as safe as it could be,'' he said. ''That's how I go to sleep at night, and how I look my family in the eye.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">NASA Plans Permanent Base For Exploration on the Moon  </span>
</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY; John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.  </div><div>1310 words</div><div>5 December 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 -- NASA announced plans on Monday for a permanent base on the Moon, to be started soon after astronauts return there around 2020.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's deputy administrator, Shana Dale, said the United States would develop rockets and spacecraft to get people to the Moon and establish a rudimentary base. There, other countries and commercial enterprises could expand the outpost to develop scientific and other interests, Ms. Dale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dale and other officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the agency envisioned a base at one of the lunar poles, to take advantage of the near-constant sunlight for solar power generation. It would have an ''open architecture'' design to which others could add the capabilities they want.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Horowitz, NASA's associate administrator for exploration, said crews of four astronauts would make weeklong missions to the Moon starting around 2020.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more equipment was set up, human stays would eventually grow to 180 days, and become permanent by 2024. By 2027, officials said, a pressurized roving vehicle on the surface would take people on expeditions far from the base.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA gave no cost estimate for the program and no design details for the base. Ms. Dale said all plans assumed that the agency would continue operating from a fixed budget of about $17 billion a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle fleet is to be retired by 2010, and the United States plans to scale back its involvement in the International Space Station. The station is still under construction, with a mission by the shuttle Discovery to lift off on Thursday. Ms. Dale said money would be shifted to the lunar exploration program from the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Bush administration and NASA have spoken in general terms about plans for a return to the Moon, followed by human spaceflight to Mars, the lunar outpost plan is the first time officials have proposed a permanent presence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going for a base on the Moon,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''It's a very, very big decision.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many gaps in the plan remain to be filled in. NASA called Monday's announcement a baseline concept.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a televised news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston on the eve of an international conference there on space exploration, Ms. Dale said the plan was developed after consultation with space agencies representing 14 countries and more than 1,000 experts in space science and commerce.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The door is open for international and commercial interests,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lunar base plan is part of a larger effort to develop an international exploration strategy, one that explains why and how humans are returning to the Moon and what they plan to do when they get there, NASA officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planning includes an international conference early next year on setting scientific goals for returning to the Moon, including those that private interests might want to pursue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Cooke, the agency official who led the lunar study group, said the plan called for putting a lander craft down near a polar crater and later adding solar-power generating units and living quarters to establish a base.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A site near the lunar South Pole, like the Shackleton Crater, would provide enough sunlight for power generation. It is also near possible deposits of valuable minerals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From this site, Mr. Cooke said, other nations could add scientific laboratories or observatories, and commercial concerns might want to process rocket fuel and other products from water and other materials that might be found in the ground nearby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said having a base did not mean that humans would go there after every lunar landing. The option remains open for some missions to go to equatorial regions, as the Apollo project landers did in the 1970s, or even to the other side of the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting to the Moon and establishing a base will require a versatile, general-purpose lander that could land anywhere and be the core of an outpost, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nickname I use for the lander is, it's a pickup truck,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''You can put whatever you want in the back. You can take it to wherever you want. So you can deliver cargo, crew, do it robotically, do it with humans on board. These are the types of things we're looking for in this system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dale said she and other NASA officials would spend part of next year visiting potential partners in the lunar project, like the space agencies of Europe, Russia and Japan, to see what they might want to contribute. Different aspects of a lunar base might come from many agreements between the United States and other nations, she said, rather than following the model of the space station of having many partners signing one agreement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there have been preliminary talks about cooperation in space with China, a growing space power which along with the United States and Russia has the ability to launch humans, it is too early to tell whether the two nations will agree to work together on human space flight projects such as the lunar base, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard McCurdy, a NASA expert who is a professor at the school of public affairs at American University in Washington, expressed some skepticism about whether the space agency could make the ambitious plan fit in its budget, even with the winding down of the shuttle program and ''throwing the keys to the International Space Station'' to the other nations that helped to build it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By relying on some of the ideas and technologies developed during the Apollo program and beyond, Mr. McCurdy said, NASA planners expect to be able to get back to the Moon for 40 percent to 60 percent of the original cost. There would be savings, too, in not having to reinvent technologies for protecting spacecraft from the heat of re-entry into the atmosphere, and not having to develop new launching facilities from scratch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said he was concerned that the technology for lunar exploration ''won't get us beyond the Moon'' and on to Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fear is that the Moon, which is now viewed as a means to get beyond the Moon, will become its own destination, for hundreds of years,'' he said. ''The easy way to go to the Moon is the hard way to go to Mars.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA has yet to design the permanent camp, last July officials at the Johnson Space Center took reporters on a tour of possible lunar habitats to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mock-ups were built of plywood and plastic, and had the crowded feel of a FEMA trailer. They addressed problems that NASA engineers expected astronauts living on the Moon to encounter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dust, for example, is not just untidy. On the Moon, the particles tend to be jagged and sticky, and so the engineers have designed an airlock to allow dust removal after any trip outside.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''A Home Away From Home''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of NASA's first priorities will be to determine where to place the proposed Moon base. NASA is focusing on areas on the Moon's poles that receive increased sunlight, which could power the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOP CANDIDATE  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has already identified one promising site at the south pole, the rim of the Shackleton crater.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT, Dec. 4 -- Airbus said on Monday that it had no immediate plans to seek government-backed financing for its new wide-body aircraft, the A350 XWB, avoiding another round of trans-Atlantic recriminations over aircraft subsidies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he refused to rule out going to European governments in the future, the chief executive of Airbus, Louis Gallois, said the company could handle the initial phase of the $13.2 billion development program from its own cash resources and by sharing the costs with its suppliers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have no imminent cash needs,'' Mr. Gallois said at a news conference in Paris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus is currently in discussions with ''about 10'' potentially significant partners that could help shoulder both the risk and the potential reward of developing the A350, Mr. Gallois said. Airbus expects to have work allocated and partners selected by the spring, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gallois also said that Airbus, which has been hit hard by the decline of the dollar because its planes are priced in declining dollars, would seek to acquire a ''natural hedging'' against this currency risk by outsourcing $2.4 billion of the development costs to American companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will be very happy to have American partners,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gallois emphasized that the A350 project would support Airbus's overhaul program, known as Power8, which it developed in response to lengthy delays and production problems with its A380 superjumbo jet. The A380 was developed with aid from European governments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The A350 XWB is not only our response to market demand,'' Mr. Gallois said. ''This program is also a crucial vehicle to transform Airbus.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans appeared to defuse, at least for the moment, a further escalation of the European-American fight at the World Trade Organization over what the United States contends are improper aircraft subsidies. Last month, the United States prepared to file a complaint against Airbus over any financial assistance it might receive for the A350, which is intended to compete with Boeing's brisk-selling 787 Dreamliner but will not enter service until 2013, four years after the American plane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By announcing its new development model, Airbus has mooted any fight or at least deferred it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may simply be a tactic to defuse the W.T.O. case,'' said George Hamlin, an aerospace consultant at Morten, Beyer &amp; Agnew in Arlington, Va. ''Or it could amount to a judgment that the company is financially mature enough to do this themselves, so why rock the boat?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus failed to drum up more than about 100 orders for its original A350 design, so it went back to the drawing board this year and unveiled the A350 XWB, which stands for extra wide body, in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer for customers, said the company might lose some of those earlier orders after the redesign, but that it would retain many, because the XWB was better. ''We'll lose some, but not as many as some of you seem to think,'' he told reporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its price will be $215 million, though discounts are common in the industry.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, the shuttle Discovery is about to blast into space. And once again, it will dock with the International Space Station, and astronauts will continue the process of building the half-completed orbiting laboratory in a mission full of daunting challenges. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the majesty of the first nighttime liftoff in more than four years, now scheduled for Thursday just before 9:36 p.m. Eastern time, will not dispel a question that has long been the subject of sharp debate among experts: What is the space station for? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, when its first components were launched as a replacement for the Mir, a worn-out Soviet-era relic, the station was billed as a manned science lab of nearly unlimited potential, with promises of advances in areas like pharmaceuticals thanks to the ultrapure crystals that could be grown in a microgravity environment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was to be finished by 2004, and it was to cost about $40 billion, shared by 16 nations, including the United States, Canada, Russia and the European Union. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those goals are barely recognizable now. As the Columbia catastrophe forced a two-and-a-half-year delay in construction missions by the shuttle fleet, and as cost overruns and changing presidential administrations forced NASA to rethink its entire science mission, the station's price tag has ballooned to $100 billion and the completion date has moved to 2010. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And questions about the station's scientific value have grown sharper than ever. David J. Goldston, the departing chief of staff for the House Science Committee, said in an interview that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration now seemed more motivated by the need to satisfy its commitments to international partners than by any compelling scientific objectives. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never heard anyone say, 'We have to do this because it's important for the future of the U.S. space program or science,' '' Mr. Goldston said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now focused heavily on building a new generation of space vehicles for exploring the Moon and Mars; yesterday it announced plans to establish an international base camp on the Moon by 2024. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials insist that today's space system is a crucial element of building tomorrow's. In particular, they say, the station is essential for researching the potential effects of prolonged weightlessness on astronauts: a round trip to Mars, as envisioned by President Bush in his long-term goals for human spaceflight, would take at least two years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the agency has also sharply cut back plans for scientific experiments. Plans to take equipment like a 10-ton centrifuge module, which was developed by the Japanese space agency and which could spin to produce artificial gravity for experiments on small animals, have been canceled. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget crunch for the program is so pronounced that this year, the station program manager, Michael T. Suffredini, looked into having all NASA science experiments aboard the station shut down during the 2007 fiscal year. (He has since backed away from that idea.) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with tight budgets, NASA faces an even tighter deadline: completing the station by 2010, when the agency is planning to retire the shuttle fleet. The next generation of vehicles will not be ready before 2014, leaving the world dependent on the Russian and European space programs, and potentially on entrepreneurs partly financed by NASA, for access to the station. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion of a completed station with such limited access, and potentially limited utility, led Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, to ask NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, in April, ''Is this going to be a techno-whoops?'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin responded, ''I certainly hope not,'' and explained that the need to complete the station and to develop tomorrow's space fleet has meant making choices about how best to use the station during the construction process. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science work in orbit had to be narrowed, he testified, with a tight focus on conducting scientific work that can help the space agency keep astronauts healthy on long missions to the Moon and Mars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA cannot do everything that our many constituencies would like us to do within our $16.8 billion budget,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risks of space travel are anything but tamed. Maintaining the station and its equipment is a continuing challenge. Maintaining astronauts' health may be an even greater one. Experts say that in zero gravity they suffer from osteoporosis at a rate 10 times that of postmenopausal women. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a trip to Mars, 40 percent of them would lose more than half of the bone mineral in their hips, according to James A. Pawelczyk, an assistant professor of physiology and kinesiology at Pennsylvania State University and a former astronaut. The returning spacefarers would have hips as delicate as eggshells. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muscle mass also declines, and efforts to prevent the process have not been very successful, said Julie Robinson, the acting manager of science projects for the station program. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, we can say we've made progress, but we're not where we need to be for exploration missions,'' she said. Outside experts have had reservations about the shift. In a report this year, the National Research Council said the space agency lacked a strong plan for scientific research or for use of the space station ''in support of the exploration missions.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not formally responded, but Dr. Robinson said the science was gearing up along the lines suggested by the report. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increasing emphasis on the next step has left many experts worried that the orbiting laboratory is being treated like an albatross, to be cast aside as quickly as possible. ''Low-earth orbit'' -- the station orbits some 220 miles above the Earth -- ''should not be abandoned in favor of going to the Moon and Mars,'' said Jeff M. Bingham, the staff director for the Senate Commerce subcommittee on science and space. ''We're sort of saying, not too fast.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current law requires that 15 percent of the station's science budget still be devoted to the hard science research that was originally acclaimed in the 1990s. The legislation also officially declares the station a national laboratory, a move intended to open the station more broadly to research and financing from outside agencies and businesses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In defense of the station's potential, Mr. Bingham points out that it is just half finished and has half the six-member crew that the fully completed station is designed to support. ''It's not a space station that is or should be expected to be producing anything of any significance by now,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists hoping to conduct research in the microgravity environment of the station say the new focus on the Moon and Mars has done great damage to their field. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since 1990, NASA has spent literally billions of dollars building up a world-class microgravity program that has been basically squandered,'' said Peter W. Voorhees, a professor of engineering at Northwestern University. ''There's a perfect example of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have talked of a return to the science focus once the next generation of vehicles is available to get projects up to the completed station, Dr. Voorhees said, but he added: ''The problem with this is the science community is not like a water faucet you can turn off and on at will. If you turn it off now, it will be extraordinarily difficult to turn it on again down the line.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Important scientific work will be done in space, said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. But it may be conducted by international partners after the United States has shifted its focus to the Moon. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be ironic,'' Mr. Logsdon said, ''if research breakthroughs came through the work of our partners, rather than research that we've chosen to forgo.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station's principal role, suggested John E. Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a group that monitors military and scientific programs, may be as ''an insurance policy, to retain a toehold in orbit, in space -- to keep the program going until we can figure out a new reason for doing it.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst case, he said, would be a variant of the ''techno-whoops'' hypothesis: a national failure of will that would leave the Moon initiative stalled and the science program mothballed. ''Maybe we'll find out that spaceflight turned out to be a historical aberration, like zeppelins,'' he said, adding: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would be the end of the frontier. I just don't want to go there.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER, Dec. 2 -- A test last week of a new communication system that would be used in times of national emergency hit hundreds of Coloradans right where they live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a secretive Air Force installation in Colorado Springs began testing the radio signal, it knocked out remote control garage door openers around the area. The communication system, intended to reach first responders, uses the same frequency as an estimated 50 million garage door openers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holly Strack, who lives near the entrance to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, said friends in the neighborhood had all had the same problem. ''I never thought my garage door was a threat to national security,'' Ms. Strack said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners were forced to go out into temperatures in the teens to open their doors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capt. Tracy Giles of the 21st Space Wing said Air Force officials were trying to figure out how to resolve the problem. ''They have turned it off to be good neighbors,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, the Air Force has the right to the frequency, which it began using nearly three years ago at some bases. Signals have also interfered with garage doors in other areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air station is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which was set up during the cold war to monitor Soviet missile and bomber threats.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, effects from the transmissions would be felt only within 10 miles, but the Colorado Springs signal is beamed from atop 6,184-foot Cheyenne Mountain, which likely extends the range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David McGuire, whose Overhead Door Company received more than 400 calls for help, said the Air Force might be able to slightly adjust the transmission frequency. If not, it will cost homeowners about $250 to have new units installed.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOBODY around the table flinched at the sharp crack of bullets Wednesday night in the front room of the Seneca Sporting Range in Ridgewood, Queens. The back room is a handgun range, and the people around the table just raised their voices to be heard over the shots, and over a gun-safety video blaring on the other side of a thin wall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also raised their voices because they were talking about the fatal police shooting last weekend of Sean Bell, the unarmed man who was leaving a strip club in the wee hours of his wedding day. Voices have been raised citywide over the shooting, and although the people at the gun range may know more about firearms than the average New Yorker, they couldn't agree on what happened outside that club.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the blame, the place's owner, John DeLoca, was saying to the man next to him, has to go to Mr. Bell's friend who, in the police account of events, had moments earlier threatened to bring a gun to the club to settle an argument.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once he raised the threat level to level red, because he said 'gun,' he threatened a police officer,'' Mr. DeLoca, a stocky man with a blunt face and a white mustache, told Joe Ested, who had come in to ask about getting a handgun license. ''I would have stopped him before he got to the car. I would have defused it in the bar over a drink, I would have called out to my help. I would have never let him get to the vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody disagrees that the officers felt threatened, Mr. Ested countered, shaking his head. ''People disagree with when you empty your gun, reload and empty it again.'' Mr. Ested, who said he used to be a policeman in Virginia, wonders if the officer who fired 31 shots overreacted, or saw something the other officers missed, or sensed a threat that did not really exist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After visiting a firearms safety class on the range, Mr. DeLoca headed back to the front room, where he sat back at the round table with another customer, a criminal defense lawyer named Fred Abrams, who wore a tan suit with a yellow rose in his lapel and matching yellow cowboy boots.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard for a police officer to make that critical decision in a split second, and it's always easier to play Monday morning quarterback after an incident,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''When the officer is in that role at that moment and he has to make that decision, he doesn't have that luxury.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeLoca nodded, repeating his point, ''The guy, when he said, 'I'm going to get my gun,' that raised that threat level.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abrams cocked his head and stopped him: ''Allegedly said.'' JAKE MOONEY  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS, Dec. 1 -- Airbus won approval from the board of its parent company late Friday to begin development of the A350-XWB family of passenger jets, a redesigned midsize plane that the European plane maker hopes will compete against the Boeing 777 and the 787 Dreamliner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board of the parent company, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, approved plans for the development of a re-engineered and wider-bodied A350 at a cost of 10 billion euros ($13 billion) at a meeting in Amsterdam. In a statement, the company said the plane would be financed primarily from Airbus cash flows and from partners, but provided few details.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Airbus and a co-chief executive of EADS, Louis Gallois, said: ''The decision follows a thorough review of all the resources available to ensure a smooth development of the family backed by a very sound program planning.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing had been a major sticking point in winning approval from the company's core shareholders. The group's biggest private shareholders -- the German automaker DaimlerChrysler and the French conglomerate Lagardere -- have been pushing to issue bonds to raise money for the plane, people briefed on the negotiations said last week. But the French government had proposed an issue of new EADS shares that it would have purchased, a move that would have increased the French state's 15 percent stake at the expense of other core shareholders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EADS said in a statement on Friday that it expected to spread the development costs of the program over the years 2007 to 2014 with the bulk of spending occurring from 2010 to 2013.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus has promoted the A350 XWB -- as in extra wide body -- as the linchpin of its recovery. The company has suffered costly setbacks to its A380 superjumbo project, and said last month that the project would be delayed two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A350, which will carry 250 to 375 passengers, is intended to challenge Boeing's 787 and 777, and is scheduled to enter service in 2013, the company said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preserving the A350 name is a reminder that this is not a wholly new plane, but a redesign of the earlier A350, which had disappointed airlines and seemed likely to be an also-ran to Boeing's 787. Airbus contends that the new version surpasses the 787 in several respects, especially its cabin, which is five inches wider than the cabin of the Boeing plane.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By AL BAKER; Cara Buckley and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.  </div><div>833 words</div><div>30 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days after the groom-to-be Sean Bell died in a 50-shot fusillade fired at his car by five police officers, city officials have gone into detail about the Police Department's guidelines for shooting at a moving vehicle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules, in the department's Patrol Guide, are clear: ''Police officers shall not discharge their firearms at or from a moving vehicle unless deadly physical force is being used against the police officer or another person present, by means other than a moving vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, by citing the guidelines, raised the possibility that the five officers who shot at Mr. Bell might have been in violation of the department's internal rule.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You should know that it is not the policy of the Police Department, where a police officer can shoot at a car when the car is being used as a weapon,'' Mr. Bloomberg said Monday at a City Hall news conference. ''So at least, in that case, it would appear that the policies of the Police Department were broken.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly said, ''As far as the policy of using deadly force against a vehicle -- we have a policy that prohibits that if the only deadly force that's being used against you is the vehicle itself.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a series of other recent confrontations in which police officers shot at drivers trying to run them down, police officials voiced unambiguous support for the officers involved. In two police shootings since last month -- one in which an officer fatally shot a driver -- the police said the shootings appeared reasonable, at least after preliminary investigations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Nov. 11, when a driver in Brooklyn was killed by the police, the officers saw him pointing a gun. In the other, in the Bronx, on Oct. 27, a loaded 9-millimeter gun was found in the driver's waistband and a second gun was in the car, according to the police.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Saturday's case, at least one police officer appeared to have believed the men in the car had a gun, but no gun was found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three police shootings -- and the official statements about them -- underscore the nettlesome aspects of trying to set rules for unforeseeable, potentially deadly situations that unfold in seconds. To some, including many retired officers, the guidelines are confusing, even contradictory, particularly since an overarching statement in the Patrol Guide states that the primary function of all officers is ''to preserve human life.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Quinn, a lawyer who is general counsel to the Sergeants Benevolent Association, observed that the policy is more restrictive than the state's penal code. And a veteran prosecutor who has investigated previous police shootings suggested that the hard-and-fast rule is contrary to common sense.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Patrol Guide definitely states that, and it's hard to believe that it says it, that you can't use deadly force against a vehicle,'' said the prosecutor, who refused to be named.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every cop you say that to says, 'Oh, come on,' '' the prosecutor said. ''It seems at best to be selectively enforced.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some defended the policy as written. John C. Cerar, a retired commander of the Police Department's firearms training section, said, ''Guidelines are guidelines, and they can be violated without breaking the rules.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the policy, Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said, ''What we look at is the totality of the situation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''We don't know the totality of this event yet.'' But of the two previous shootings, Mr. Browne said, ''There was more than the threat of the automobile alone involved.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in the Oct. 27 shooting, Mr. Quinn said that Sgt. Edward Warren was not shooting at a car, but ''at a driver who was armed and who was about to shoot a cop.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is idiotic,'' he said of the policy. ''There are absolutely circumstances where a car can be used as a deadly weapon, and the only way a cop can save his life or the life of a fellow officer or the life of a civilian is to use his handgun.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly has been careful not to characterize the conduct of the five police officers involved in the shooting of Mr. Bell. None of those officers have been interviewed by officials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk of a gun, however, has colored the early reports of what happened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a confrontation before the shooting outside a Queens strip club, Joseph Guzman, an acquaintance of Mr. Bell's, shouted, ''Yo, get my gun,'' the police said. Later, according to the account of a police lieutenant at the scene, a detective working undercover who was shadowing Mr. Bell and his acquaintances called the lieutenant just before the shooting to say the situation was getting ''hot,'' and, ''I think there's a gun.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY  </div><div>531 words</div><div>30 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 -- The third and final space shuttle flight of the year, an intricate mission to continue construction of the International Space Station, is to blast off on Dec. 7, NASA managers announced Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a two-day meeting to review the mission at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the shuttle Discovery would be launched next Thursday at 9:35 p.m., the first night launching in four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA has restricted the three shuttle launchings to daylight hours so that it could take detailed photographs and measurements to assure that safety modifications made after the accident were working. Columbia and its crew of seven were lost while returning to Earth because foam debris from the external fuel tank damaged the craft during the launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we're all ready to resume night launches,'' N. Wayne Hale, NASA's shuttle program director, said at a televised news conference after the meeting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale and William Gerstenmaier, the agency's associate administrator for space flight, said radar and images taken during liftoff using light generated by the shuttle's rocket engines should be able to spot any potentially damaging debris even in surrounding darkness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were really no dissenting opinions on the night launch,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said data from the three previous flights launched in daylight showed that modifications had greatly reduced the danger from debris. The added data, he said, allowed NASA engineers to refine their calculations of the debris hazard risk and reclassify it from ''probable catastrophic'' to ''infrequent catastrophic.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space shuttle flights remain hazardous, he said, but the debris hazard now can be placed in perspective with other risks, such as those posed by the craft's rocket engines and meteoroids striking the ship in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not nearly as bad as we thought last summer,'' Mr. Hale said. ''We're concerned, but we're not nearly as frightened as before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA needs the option of launching the shuttle at night if it is to meet a busy schedule to complete the space station by 2010, when the shuttle fleet is to be retired.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its scheduled 12-day mission, Discovery and its crew of seven are to deliver a metal truss segment to extend the space station's structural backbone. In addition, astronauts are to conduct three space walks to help rewire the electrical and cooling systems, and retract a solar power panel that has been supplying the station with electricity for six years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said the mission is so complex because it involves changing the station's entire electrical system, including switching most of the outpost's equipment off and powering it up again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This task will keep both the astronauts and ground crews busier than ever before to get it done right, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a typical day, he said, the space station gets 800 commands from the ground. During this mission, more than 4,000 commands are scheduled for execution during a critical three-day period, he added.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saying no to one of your best customers may not seem like a smart business strategy. But that is exactly what Boeing said this year to Southwest Airlines, which buys more Boeing planes than any other carrier, having taken delivery of 477 to date. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southwest flies only Boeing 737s, and it typically buys them in bulk. But when the airline wanted to add two planes to a recent order of 80, Boeing turned it down. It did, however, offer a Plan B, by pointing Southwest in the direction of two slightly used 737s that Ford Motor wanted to shed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one is more important to Boeing than Southwest,'' said Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of Airline Monitor, a trade publication. ''If Boeing is not willing to raise production and build for Southwest, you can be sure they won't accommodate anyone else.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was method to Boeing's seeming madness. With aviation booming and airlines lining up to buy Boeing planes, the company is trying to manage what could be too much of a good thing. Granted, it is a potential problem that is much easier to tackle now that its archrival, Airbus, is stumbling. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing, which is based in Chicago, is trying to avoid mistakes of the past. In the last aviation boom, in 1997 and 1998, Boeing gorged itself on orders, but its production lines could not keep up and ground to a halt. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the company flooded the market with too many planes and ultimately had to sell them at cut-rate prices. Boeing's write-offs came to more than $4 billion in 1997 and 1998, executives were sent packing and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Boeing's stock plunged, as did profits, and many wondered whether Boeing would ever regain its footing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, having learned its lesson, Boeing is adopting a polar opposite strategy as it faces a new wave of orders that, if not managed right, could swamp the company again. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Boeing's new head of commercial aviation pressed his message of moderation to the Wings Club, an industry group that had gathered in Seattle. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this hot market, it would be easy to be consumed with the desire to sell anything to people walking through the door who want to buy and push our production system to the point where you could break it,'' said Scott E. Carson, the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Aviation. ''It's much harder to say, 'I'm sorry, we're sold out.' '' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet that is exactly what Boeing is telling customers these days -- not just Southwest -- as it slowly increases its airplane production while holding firm on its sticker prices. Demand is jumping, especially now that Airbus has had design and delivery problems with its two new offerings: the midsize A350 and the superjumbo A380. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Boeing, for instance, orders for its 787, nicknamed the Dreamliner -- which will not hit the market until 2008 -- are so strong that it is sold out for four years, and the earliest a new customer can get a plane is 2013. In all, 36 customers have ordered 455 planes. The venerable 747, which was headed to the end of the line, has. meanwhile, received a reprieve as airlines have shown renewed interest in the plane. Other popular jets have a two-year waiting list. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing's stock, which traded around $30 a share in aviation slump after 9/11, has risen sharply, and closed Monday at $87.37. Boeing earned $492 million in 2002; it earned $2.57 billion in 2005. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carson is a 33-year Boeing veteran who helped dig the company out of the 1997-98 crisis. He succeeded Alan R. Mulally as head of the commercial aviation unit in September when Mr. Mulally, in a surprise move, left to become chief executive at Ford. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Mr. Carson is in charge, he vows to make restraint a virtue -- and a path to fatter profit margins. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly, we are much more disciplined than in 1997 and 1998,'' Mr. Carson said in a recent interview. ''The message is, Don't get ahead of yourself; don't go crazy about how we ramp up.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''We have to communicate that openly with customers and suppliers to be sure they understand why this is good for the industry. The role of the industry leader is to demonstrate discipline and restraint in the marketplace.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To industry analysts, this is a 180-degree turn from the last boom, when Boeing responded to Airbus's new competitive threat by trying to sell so many planes that Airbus would be overwhelmed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the Khrushchev approach,'' Mr. Greenslet said. ''Remember when he was at the United Nations and was banging his shoe and saying, 'We will bury you.' It was the bury-you strategy and it did more damage to Boeing than the competition.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout from that period is still fresh in the memories of today's Boeing leadership. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the guys at Boeing saw their bosses get fired the last time,'' said Troy Lahr, an aviation analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, a Baltimore brokerage firm. This time, the company has sharply cut the number of products it builds. In the late 1990s, Boeing customers had a choice of eight planes, including the MD series of aircraft it inherited from its merger with McDonnell-Douglas. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it builds only the 737, the 767, 777 and the giant 747. The 787 Dreamliner is still in the development phase. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing today has only about half the suppliers that it did a decade ago and has shifted more of the risk -- and cost -- of developing and building the airplanes to them. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major parts of Boeing planes are built by suppliers in Japan and Italy and come to the Seattle area, where the commercial aviation division is based, only for final assembly. In the United States, its airframe manufacturing operation in Wichita, Kan., was sold to investors and now works for Boeing as a subcontractor, absorbing costs and risks Boeing once shouldered. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The world has changed, and Boeing has changed with it,'' said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo. ''They've offloaded a lot of production. They are farming out everything to others so they don't have to build it. '' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That future is perhaps best represented by the 787 Dreamliner. It will be the first commercial jet made in large part from composite plastics, rather than aluminum. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wings are made by Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji Heavy Industries, all of Japan. Italian companies are building part of the fuselage, and Boeing has contracted with its former Wichita operation, now called Spirit AeroSystems, to make other parts of the fuselage. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These parts will be shipped to Seattle -- many on a 747. For instance, barrel sections of fuselage that are made in Italy will be flown to a subcontractor, Vought Aircraft Industries, in South Carolina. There, they will be connected with parts of the wing from Japan, stuffed with wires, tubes and other systems and tested and painted. Once that is done, the mostly finished plane will be shipped, again on a 747, to Boeing's plant in Everett, Wash., for final assembly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All Boeing does is design it and glue it together,'' said Mr. Boyd, the aviation consultant. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a downturn in orders, Boeing does not have to face the challenge of what to do with a permanent, unionized work force. It also means that fewer workers are needed in Everett since less of the work is done there. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is happy with this outsourcing -- especially Boeing's union work force, which numbers about 20,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have an issue with the vendors and the suppliers,'' said Connie Kelliher, spokeswoman for Machinist Union District 751, the largest union at Boeing. ''We are the smartest, most skilled work force in the world. If there is a problem with vendors, our workers make it right. Boeing is very public about wanting its suppliers to share the risk. But they've let go of core competencies. If we are good enough to bail them out, we are good enough to have the work left in our hands.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this outsourcing is not without business risk, as well. ''The danger is that your supplier can become someone else's supplier,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''There is no stopping Spirit or Vought from doing business for Airbus. When Boeing owned all the factories, it only did stuff for Boeing.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, Boeing is taking small steps to increase the number of planes it is building. It has stepped up the pace by creating moving assembly lines for the 777 and the 737, something it did not do before and a move that enables the planes to be built more efficiently and quickly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing does not disclose how many planes it builds a month, but Mr. Lahr of Stifel Nicolaus estimated that by 2008, Boeing would add 3 planes to its monthly production of 28 737s, it would build one more 777 to reach eight a month and, at some point, would add three more to an anticipated monthly run of seven 787s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest challenges ahead for Boeing is ensuring that the 787 stays on schedule and that all its technological innovations are a success. In the long term, it hopes to raise its monthly production slowly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real challenge, once you work out the 787 design, is that Boeing wants to move at a rate that is unprecedented for a widebody plane,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in northern Virginia. ''No one has built more than 7 widebodies a month, and they are talking about 10 a month.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing says, however, that increased outsourcing and the more efficient moving assembly lines will enable it to pick up the pace without risking some of the problems it had in 1997 and 1998. In addition, for at least the first two years, there will be no increases in the anticipated 787 production rates, no matter how strong the demand, Boeing said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a media conference call this month, Michael Bair, general manager of the 787 program, said there was no danger Boeing would fall into its old trap. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are being very, very careful in the front end of the program that we don't get greedy and overcommit before we have all the potential kinks worked out in the production systems,'' Mr. Bair said. ''So we have not touched the first two years of production in terms of what our ramp up is going to be -- and we won't.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGAPORE, Nov. 27 -- Boeing is enjoying heady times in Asia. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence came from Seoul last week, when Korean Air Lines announced an order for 25 jets from Boeing, the largest single order ever from a Korean carrier. The deal is estimated to be worth $5.5 billion at list prices, but significantly less once the discounts typical of such negotiations are taken into consideration. Neither side would disclose the price. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to fast-growing economies, Asia's airlines have been lining up to buy new planes to feed surging demand for travel. The International Air Transport Association forecasts that traffic in Asia will grow almost 7 percent this year, compared with roughly 5 percent in North America and Europe. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Asia-Pacific is faster-growing and therefore an attractive market for the manufacturers,'' said Andrew Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ''Boeing has had an exceptionally strong year.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Boeing is soaring, its only significant competitor, Airbus, has suffered a string of embarrassing setbacks that have delayed delivery of its A380 superjumbo jet by more than two years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the winds of international politics, crucial to multibillion-dollar aircraft sales, are also blowing in Boeing's favor, thanks to growing security jitters and concerns about possible protectionist moves by a Democratic Congress. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South Korean purchase helps Boeing deflect a recent assault in Asia by Airbus, which last year outsold its American rival in the region for the first time. According to the aviation consultancy Airclaims, two-thirds of all the commercial planes flying in Asia were built by Boeing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That revived edge is all the more important now that Asia's growth is helping offset slower sales increases at home. Boeing's sales in Asia rose to 16 percent of its global revenue last year, from roughly 13 percent in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next 20 years, Boeing estimates Asia will grow to represent 36 percent of the global aircraft market. China, not surprisingly, is at the forefront. Boeing forecasts that China will spend about $280 billion in the next two decades on aircraft, becoming the world's second-largest plane market, after the United States. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-October, China's largest carrier, China Southern Airlines, announced that it would buy 12 Boeing jets in an order worth up to $1.8 billion. All told, Boeing has won roughly 100 orders in China this year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may seem surprising that even more orders have not come Boeing's way, given the troubles at Airbus. The largest customer for the A380, Emirates Airlines of Dubai, has vented its frustration over the delays by canceling a $4 billion order for smaller A340s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thai Airways International is discussing whether to proceed with its order for six A380s. And Singapore Airlines, the deep-pocketed carrier that expected to receive the first A380 this year, will unveil its new luxurious A380 cabin next month -- on a Boeing 777 instead. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing said it would not be stealing Airbus customers, largely because it is struggling just to clear the backlog of orders it already has. ''You don't just turn the switch and overnight increase your production levels,'' said Wade Cornelius, vice president for business development and global strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Renton, Wash. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cornelius said Boeing's suppliers were stretched to the limit in terms of production, with many experiencing shortages for raw materials like aluminum and titanium. As a result, he said, by the time Boeing could deliver a rival aircraft to an A380 customer, Airbus would probably have already been able to deliver the A380 originally ordered. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That explains in part, analysts said, why Qantas Airways recently responded to the delays in its A380 deliveries by increasing its order from 12 to 20, taking advantage of the situation to negotiate lower prices. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airlines are also willing to stick with Airbus to maintain competition between the major aircraft makers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reality is that this industry needs a highly competitive offering from two established, incredible manufacturers,'' said Stephen Forshaw, vice president for public affairs at Singapore Airlines. ''We rely on -- every time we go to the market -- running a highly competitive process between the two manufacturers and getting the best deal.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to traffic growth, high fuel prices are pushing carriers to buy new, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Boeing is also being helped by predictions of long-term growth in demand for cargo out of China. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most serious weakness in Boeing's position in Asia, analysts say, is in the rapidly growing market of low-cost carriers, where the Airbus A320 has emerged as the aircraft of choice. The budget airline AirAsia, based in Malaysia, for example, has ordered 100 A320s to expand and update its fleet of Boeing 737s, saying the A320 is a more profitable aircraft to run. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cornelius disputed this analysis, however, saying that Boeing's latest version of the 737 was competitive. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing partly credits its long-term relationships with customers for its market lead in Asia. After 50 years in Japan, Boeing says it has an 80 percent market share. Japanese airlines have not ordered any A380s. Korean Air's fleet is 75 percent Boeing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts say diplomacy has also played a major role and that the longstanding alliance of the United States, Japan and South Korea also helps explain Boeing's dominance in those markets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These aircraft purchases are always very close to high-level politics,'' said Peter Harbison, managing director of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney, Australia. In China, Beijing still decides what aircraft the country's three largest airlines fly. ''If Beijing says they like Washington today, they buy Boeing,'' said Peter Drolet, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade relations can often play a role in determining which company wins an aircraft order. And since aircraft orders are so big, Asian exporters can use them to blunt criticism over yawning trade surpluses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They make a big aircraft purchase and, bang, billions of dollars of trade surplus are wiped off the board,'' Mr. Drolet said. Contracts may still coincide with state visits, Mr. Herdman said. ''But behind the scenes,'' he added, ''there are people with sharp pencils and calculators weighing up the options.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reciprocal investment is also important, analysts say. All Nippon Airways is the first customer for Boeing's 787. It is not surprising, then, that many of the aircraft's parts are being made in Japan. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus plans to apply that model to China, where it announced last month during a visit to Beijing by Jacques Chirac, the president of France, that it would build an assembly plant in Tianjin. China then announced a $10 billion deal to buy 150 Airbus A320s, the largest single order for the planes so far. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing has dismissed the factory as an empty gesture. Assembly represents a relatively low percentage of an aircraft's cost, Mr. Cornelius said. ''Design, production and the integration of all the other components is where the real value is,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing says it is buying an increasing number of parts from China for export to its assembly plants in the United States. Mr. Cornelius said Boeing already had $600 million in supply contracts in China and that major Chinese-made parts could now be found in roughly 34 percent of the 12,000 Boeing planes in service around the world. Analysts say the pressure from China on Boeing and Airbus to base more production in the country is intense. Its reasoning is no secret: China is eager to build its own aircraft industry. ''All China wants is the ability to build large aircraft,'' Mr. Harbison said. ''That's where China is heading.'' </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has changed in New York since Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was killed in a hail of 41 bullets fired by city police officers in 1999. Mr. Diallo's death sent racial tensions in the city nearly to a boiling point -- helped along by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who regularly shunned meetings with black leaders and failed to treat the crisis with the urgency it required.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, are dealing differently with their own Diallo-style disaster. Police officers firing 50 rounds early last Saturday killed Sean Bell, an unarmed man who was to have married his high school sweetheart later in the day. The mayor and the commissioner moved quickly to answer questions and to hear the concerns of the victim's family and the community. But their responsiveness will not bring back Sean Bell. The challenge here is far greater than good communications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officers who killed Mr. Bell were part of a sting operation at a Queens nightclub suspected of narcotics, prostitution and weapons violations. According to published reports, the officers have said that as Mr. Bell and his friends left the club and headed toward their car, an undercover detective heard one of them say he was going to get a gun. They also reportedly said that when the men entered the car, the detective pulled his gun and identified himself, but the car suddenly gunned forward, hit him in the shin and then struck an unmarked police minivan. The officers then opened fire.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tragedy may simply involve two sets of very frightened men who reacted instinctively to what they thought was imminent danger. But only one of the sets was armed. There was no gun in the car, nor on the shooting victims, who sat helpless inside while five police officers began firing 50 rounds at them. One emptied his gun, a 9mm semiautomatic, reloaded and emptied it again, accounting for 31 rounds. The shooting appears to have been frantic, with bullets shattering windows as far away as the AirTrain station, hundreds of yards from the scene. Two of Mr. Bell's companions were injured; miraculously, there were no other casualties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Diallo tragedy, the officers involved in the Queens shooting were not all white. They were also not inexperienced. The first bullet came from an officer with five years on the job, and the detective who fired the 31 rounds had 12. But it is hard to explain their actions as anything but panic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police rules mandate that an officer pause after firing three rounds to assess the situation. If the shooters had followed procedures, they might have seen there was no threat before it was too late. Mayor Bloomberg has rightly called for a quick and impartial investigation. The officers must be held accountable for what has happened. But the Police Department must also confront the fact that a disaster that everyone swore to prevent seven years ago has repeated itself in Queens.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REINING IN ORDERS AT BOEING -- Business is booming at Boeing, where airlines are lining up to buy new aircraft while Boeing's chief rival, Airbus, struggles with production delays. Asian countries, in particular, are clamoring for planes to meet their surging air travel demands -- last week, Korean Air Lines ordered 25 Boeing jets. But Boeing is leery of overcommitting itself, a mistake it made -- and paid dearly for -- in the last airline boom. [Page C1.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKS TAKE A TUMBLE Concerns about a weak holiday shopping season combined with broader anxiety about an economic slowdown, handing Wall Street its biggest decline in four months. Retailers like Wal-Mart, whose year-over-year sales fell in November, suffered some of the steepest losses. [C1.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORD AT BANK, ASSETS IN HAND -- Ford Motor Company essentially mortgaged nearly all of its domestic assets, including factories, office buildings, patents and trademarks, to raise $18 billion to pay for several more years of painful restructuring. Other auto companies have put up manufacturing equipment and other collateral to secure loans, but Ford has never done so. [C1.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DECLINE IN AMERICANs' INCOME -- The income that Americans reported to the tax collector in 2004, adjusted for inflation, was below its peak in 2000, government data showed. Average real incomes declined $1,641, or 3 percent, to $53,974. [C1.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CERTIFYING THE CATCH OF THE DAY -- What makes a fish organic? The Agriculture Department's answer could determine whether Americans will be able to add fish to the growing list of organic foods they are buying, and whether fish farmers will be able to tap into that trend.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WAL-MART TO ENTER INDIA -- Wal-Mart announced a joint venture with an Indian partner, Bharti Enterprises, with which it will open hundreds of Wal-Mart-branded superstores across India over the next five years, starting in 2007. [C3.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIGHTING AN OLD WRONG -- The Supreme Court took up the question of how to treat a discriminatory action that happened long ago but that has effects that continue to the present day.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Sunday about a police shooting in Queens in which a bridegroom driving away from a strip club was killed and two of his friends wounded gave an erroneous age, supplied by the police, for one victim. (The same error appeared in some copies on Monday in a front-page article about ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat.) The victim, Joseph Guzman, who was critically wounded, is 31, not 21. A map with the article on Monday misstated the location of a storefront gate that the bridegroom backed his car into; it is on the east side of Liverpool Street in Jamaica, not at 94-08 Liverpool, which is on the west side. (A corrected version is at nytimes.com/region.) A picture caption in some copies with a related article on Monday misspelled the surname of another victim, who was also wounded. He is Trent Benefield, not Benfield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Nov 29 2006  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Nov. 27 about ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among police officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat -- referred incorrectly to a 1995 Bronx bodega robbery in which multiple shots were fired. Officers fired 107 rounds at the robbers -- not 125, the number initially provided by the police; and the robbers did in fact return fire. (The number of shots fired by the police was revised during the investigation, which also revealed that the robbers had fired back, according to law enforcement officials.) A reader pointed out the errors in an e-mail message in November; this correction was delayed while the Police Department and the Bronx district attorney's office checked their records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Feb 09 2007   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is known in police parlance as ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat. It spreads like germs, like laughter, or fear. An officer fires, so his colleagues do, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon appears to have happened last year, when eight officers fired 43 shots at an armed man in Queens, killing him. In July, three officers fired 26 shots at a pit bull that had bitten a chunk out of an officer's leg in a Bronx apartment building. And there have been other episodes: in 1995, in the Bronx, officers fired 125 bullets during a bodega robbery, with one officer firing 45 rounds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just what happened on Saturday is still being investigated. Police experts, however, suggested in interviews yesterday that contagious shooting played a role in a fatal police shooting in Queens Saturday morning. According to the police account, five officers fired 50 shots at a bridegroom who, leaving his bachelor party at a strip club, twice drove his car into a minivan carrying plainclothes police officers investigating the club.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bridegroom, Sean Bell, who was to be married hours later, was killed, and two of his friends were wounded, one critically.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the layman, and to the loved ones of those who were shot, 50 shots seems a startlingly high number, especially since the men were found to be unarmed. And police experts concede that the number was high. Yet they also note that in those chaotic and frightening fractions of a second between quiet and gunfire, nothing is clear-cut, and blood is pumping furiously. Even 50 shots can be squeezed off in a matter of seconds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can teach as much as we can,'' said John C. Cerar, a retired commander of the Police Department's firearms training section. ''The fog of the moment happens. Different things happen that people don't understand. Most people really believe what it's like in television, that a police officer can take a gun and shoot someone out of the saddle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative duty yesterday -- without their guns -- as the Police Department and the Queens district attorney investigated the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and relatives of Mr. Bell, joined by the Rev. Al Sharpton, staged a rally and a march to demand answers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officers have not yet been interviewed by police investigators or prosecutors to give their account.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again and again, the focus of the day returned to the number of bullets that went flying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the officers fired more than half the rounds, pausing to reload, and then emptying it again, 31 shots in all, according to the police. Another officer fired 11 shots. The others fired four shots, three shots and one shot apiece, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is the total number of shots that shook and angered the families of the men and community leaders. ''How many shots?'' Mr. Sharpton asked yesterday, over and over, in a chant at a rally in a park near Mary Immaculate Hospital, where the wounded men were being treated. The crowd called back, ''Fifty!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistically, the shooting is an aberration. The number of shots fired per officer who acted in the 112 shooting incidents this year, through Nov. 19, is 3.2, said Paul J. Browne, a department spokesman. Last year, that number was 3.7 shots fired per officer in 109 incidents. They are down from 4.6 in 2000 and 5.0 in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But shootings with high numbers of shots fired, however rare, call to mind dark events of the city's past, like the 1999 killing of Gidone Busch, who was clutching a hammer when officers fired 12 times, and, most notably, the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 bullets, also in 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1995 Bronx bodega robbery in which officers fired 125 shots, the suspects did not fire back. ''They were shooting to the echo of their own gunfire,'' a former police official said at the time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shooting on Saturday unfolded in a flash. An undercover officer posted inside the Club Kalua, a site of frequent drug, weapon and prostitution complaints in Jamaica, overheard an exchange between a stripper and a man that led the officer to suspect the man was armed, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said on Saturday. The undercover officer alerted the officers acting as backup outside -- there were seven officers in all -- about 4 a.m., setting into motion the events to follow later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight men left the club and argued briefly with another man, with one from the group saying, ''Yo, get my gun,'' Mr. Kelly said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight men apparently split into two groups of four, with one group piling into a Nissan Altima driven by Mr. Bell, Commissioner Kelly said. As an undercover detective who had been following the group on foot approached the vehicle, Mr. Bell drove into him, striking his leg, before plowing into a minivan carrying two backup officers, the commissioner said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Altima reversed, mounting a sidewalk and hitting the lowered gate of a building before going forward and striking the van again. The officers opened fire, striking Mr. Bell, 23, twice, in the right arm and neck, Commissioner Kelly said. The critically wounded man, Joseph Guzman, 31, was struck 11 times, and the third man, Trent Benefield, 23, three times. Mr. Kelly said it was unclear whether there was a fourth man in the car and what became of him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person familiar with the case who knows the detectives' version of events said yesterday that it was Mr. Guzman who asked for his gun, and that the first undercover detective on foot clearly identified himself to the occupants of the car and, gun drawn, told them to get out. Instead, the person said, they roared toward him. That detective fired the first shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ensuing barrage, one shot struck the window of a house, another a window at an AirTrain platform, injuring two Port Authority police officers with flying glass. It appeared that the Altima was struck by 21 shots, fewer than half of the number fired, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole thing most likely took less than a minute. The officer who fired 31 times could have done so in fewer than 20 seconds, with the act of reloading taking less than one second, Mr. Cerar said. The 49 shots that followed the undercover detective's first may have been contagious shooting, said one former police official who insisted on anonymity because the investigation is continuing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He shoots, and you shoot, and the assumption is he has a good reason for shooting. You saw it in Diallo. You see it in a lot of shootings,'' the official said. ''You just chime in. I don't mean the term loosely. But you see your partner, and your reflexes take over.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon of officers' firing dozens of shots at a time dates back in part to 1993 and the department's switch from six-shot .38-caliber revolvers, cumbersome to reload, to semiautomatic pistols that hold 15 rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. The change, like any of its magnitude, followed years of studies and differences of opinion, and finally came into effect after the 1986 murder of a police officer, Scott Gadell, who was reloading his six-shooter when he was fatally shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commissioner Kelly, during his first term in the office, in 1992 and 1993, ordered a switch to semiautomatics, but ordered the clips modified to hold only 10 rounds. That modification was later undone, prompting him, after Mr. Diallo's shooting six years later, to speculate in a New York Times op-ed article, ''Now may be the time to re-impose it and to intensify training that teaches police officers to hold their fire until they know why they are shooting.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College, said a high number of shots fired underscores the threat the officers felt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only reason to be shooting in New York City is that you or someone else is going to be killed and it's going to be imminent,'' he said. ''It's highly unlikely you fire a shot or two shots. You fire as many shots as you have to, to extinguish the threat. You don't fire one round and say: 'Did I hit him? Is he hit?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cerar said, ''Until we have some substitute for a firearm, there will always be a situation where more rounds are fired than in other situations.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Map: ''A Police Shooting''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This account was provided by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 a.m. One officer overhears a dancer at the club complain to a man that she is being bothered. The man she complains about appears to the police to pat his waistband, indicating that he has a gun. One undercover officer who overhears the exchange with the dancer later exits to notify his supervisor and backup team of possible trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. 4 a.m. An altercation occurs outside Club Kalua involving as many as eight or nine men. According to police reports, one of the men, said to be in Sean Bell's party, says, ''Yo, get my gun.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. The men split into two groups and disperse. An undercover detective follows one, including the person alleged to have made the remark about his gun, as they make their way east on 94th Avenue and turn south on Liverpool Street.

Two officers in the Camry fire a total of five times.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a foot jammed into a ladder to hold him steady, Russian astronaut Mikhail V. Tyurin sliced a lightweight golf ball into orbit last week with a one-handed swing during a space walk outside the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shot some 200 miles above the Earth was a promotion for a Canadian golf club manufacturer, which paid an undisclosed sum to the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation in the latest venture by the Russians to subsidize their space program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the Russians have allowed a Kodak banner on their side of the space station, launched a rocket with a Pizza Hut logo, and used its program to promote Pepsi, RadioShack and Lego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian space agency's tourism business is booming, too. Since 2002, four tourists have shelled out about $20 million each to ride into space aboard a Russian Soyuz craft. The most recent was Anousheh Ansari, a telecom entrepreneur, in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians recently said they had raised the ticket price by $1 million and that all seats were booked for the next two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's next? Space Adventures Ltd., which has worked with the Russian space agency to send wealthy tourists into orbit, announced this summer that for a mere $15 million (on top of the $20 million or so spent to reach space), a tourist will be able to take an hour-and-a-half space walk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also partnered with the Russians to send two tourists on a trip around the moon, with a departure sometime in 2010. The price? $100 million. Each.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So with all that money being made on the final frontier, why is it that NASA, with its own funding problems, has not pursued the ventures that the Russians have exploited with entrepreneurial zeal?  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a golf swing made by a Russian astronaut outside the space station misstated the weight of the ball. On earth, it would have been one-tenth of an ounce, not 10 ounces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Nov 25 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov. 22 -- It was a typical agenda for a spacewalk on Wednesday. Attach a space station antenna and install a proton detector to monitor solar eruptions. But first, some golf.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a promotion for a Canadian manufacturer of golf clubs, a Russian astronaut used a 6-iron to drive a 10-ounce golf ball off the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronaut, Mikhail V. Tyurin, had to make the shot one handed, with a foot jammed into a ladder to keep him steady.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station commander, Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, was the caddie, placing the ball on a special tee and standing by in case his colleague slipped.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Tyurin teed off, Captain Lopez-Alegria said: ''It was an excellent shot. I can still see it as a little dot that's moving away from us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the latest commercial venture by the Russian Space Agency, which is receiving an undisclosed amount from Element 21 Golf of Toronto. The agency has also taken tourists to the station, despite initial objections from NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave its approval for the golf outing after it was satisfied that the fragile solar panels on the station would not be in danger or that the ball would not settle into the dangerous flotilla of space junk along the flight path of the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This isn't the type of experiment that would be typically designed and conducted for the U.S. program,'' Kirk Shireman, deputy manager of the NASA space station office, said. ''But if it's done by the Russians for their purposes and does serve the purpose of captivating students, I'm glad to do it, as long as it's a safe thing to execute.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ball sailed into orbit trailing the station. In a few days, it should succumb to Earth's gravity and burn up in the upper atmosphere, Mr. Shireman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one other golf ball is out there. On the Apollo 14 mission in 1971, Alan B. Shepard Jr. used a makeshift club for a long drive that he boasted went ''miles and miles.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA, Nov. 21 -- Shares in the Spirit AeroSystems Holdings unit of Onex, the Canadian leveraged buyout company, rose 12 percent on Tuesday, their first day of trading in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onex formed Spirit in June 2005 after acquiring Boeing's aircraft component factories in Wichita, Kan., and Tulsa and McAlester, Okla., for $1.1 billion in cash and the assumption of about $400 million in debt. Tuesday's initial public offering, which sold about 41 percent of Spirit's shares, gave the company a market value of about $3.8 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Spirit opened at $26 and ended the day's trading at $29 a share.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onex, based in Toronto, declined to comment on the successful offering, saying that it was in a quiet period before releasing financial results.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not the only beneficiary of the market's warm reaction. A large number of employees and managers at Spirit were minority investors. In addition, about five million shares were set aside for Spirit's unionized employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing, which remains Spirit's largest customer, sold the unit as part of an effort to concentrate on final assembly of aircraft by outsourcing parts making. In January, Spirit added Airbus to its customer list by buying a wing factory in England and Scotland from BAE Systems for $162 million. That purchase was financed with Spirit's revenues.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirit, which is based in Wichita, earned $86 million on revenue of $2.36 billion in the first nine months of its fiscal year, and it has benefited from a surge in aircraft orders. It provides lightweight carbon fiber fuselage parts for Boeing's successful new model, the 787 Dreamliner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public offering has reduced Onex's control of the company's voting shares to 92 percent from 98.2 percent. It now holds about 57 percent of the common stock.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirit will get about $270.8 million from the stock sale, and $100 million of that will be used to pay down debt. The Onex investor group will receive $1.16 billion.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD  </div><div>609 words</div><div>22 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In words and somber tones usually associated with a death in the family, engineers and scientists said yesterday that the Mars Global Surveyor, the most durable spacecraft ever to orbit that planet, had fallen silent and was given little chance of revival.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year-old spacecraft -- which mapped the Martian surface, recorded seasonal and annual climate changes, and gathered evidence of water in the planet's past -- has not communicated with flight controllers since Nov. 2. A disabled solar power array is the prime suspect.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may have lost a dear old friend and teacher,'' said Michael Meyer, chief scientist for Mars exploration at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Dr. Meyer spoke at a news teleconference from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the mission is being directed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuk K. Li, the laboratory's Mars program manager, said the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the newest spacecraft to explore the planet, drew blanks in several attempts on Friday and Monday to make a photographic inspection of the Global Surveyor. Given that failure, mission officials said yesterday that they had exhausted the most likely means of re-establishing radio communications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two spacecraft regularly passed within 60 miles of each other. But in the last three weeks, ground antennas have not been able to track the Global Surveyor's orbit to fix its probable position, which could have been altered by the malfunction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While we have not exhausted everything we have to do,'' Dr. Li said, ''we believe the prospect of recovery of Mars Global Surveyor is not looking very good at all.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers said they planned a long-shot effort to communicate with the spacecraft through one of the two roving vehicles still operating on the Martian surface. This week, flight controllers will radio a command for the Global Surveyor to use its transmitter to send signals that could be picked up by the rover Opportunity. Any message would be relayed to Earth through yet another spacecraft, the Mars Odyssey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traffic at Mars is fairly heavy these days. The United States has three orbiters and two surface rovers, and the European Space Agency has an orbiter, the Mars Express.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the oldest of these was the Global Surveyor, which was launched on Nov. 7, 1996, and reached Mars orbit the next September. The craft was designed to operate for a minimum of one Mars year, or 25 Earth months. It kept going for almost five Mars years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Thorpe, the Global Surveyor manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the spacecraft had cost $156 million to build and launch and $20 million annually to operate the first few years, then about $6 million in each recent year. NASA recently agreed to extend mission operations another two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is an extraordinary machine that has done things the designers never envisioned,'' Mr. Thorpe said, noting that it had overcome many handicaps: a broken solar panel soon after launching and failure of some navigation components.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus plans to increase production of its A320 family of airliners as the company bets on strong demand for its smaller planes to take the sting out of costly delays to its A380 superjumbo jet. An Airbus spokesman, Justin Dubon, confirmed the plans, reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company, based in Toulouse, would produce 32 of the single-aisle planes each month starting in January, instead of the 30 produced currently. Production will increase further, to 34 planes a month in March 2008 and to 36 by December that year. Before the increase was decided, the first delivery windows available to new customers were in 2010, Mr. Dubon said. Faster production will open up new slots well before that date.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flexible wing is under development that may lead to aircraft that are more fuel efficient and maneuverable. Developed by FlexSys Inc. and the Air Force, the flexible wing uses internal actuators to change its shape as conditions require. A flexible leading edge would allow for smoother airflow over a helicopter rotor or airplane wing. The wing can flex its trailing edge up or down by 10 degrees, so an airliner's traditional mechanical flaps, whose sudden change in curvature adds drag, would be eliminated. FRANK O'CONNELL  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''LEADING EDGE ON HELICOPTER ROTORS''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conventional helicopter rotor, the blade experiences stall and vibration as it moves toward the retreating side, limiting the speed and lift performance. The flexible leading edge prevents this.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONVENTIONAL ROTOR  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airflow separates from the retreating rotor's surface, reducing lift and causing the blade to stall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FLEXIBLE ROTOR  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flexing the leading edge down keeps the flow attached, preventing stalls, increasing lift and reducing drag.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRAILING EDGE ON FIXED-WING PLANES  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flaps on current fixed-wing airliners create drag, increasing fuel consumption. Flexible wings might prevent some of the drag.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONVENTIONAL WING  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mechanical flaps disrupt the airflow, causing it to separate from the wing's surface, increasing aerodynamic drag on the aircraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FLEXIBLE WING  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air flows smoothly and without separation over the seamless wing surface, reducing drag and increasing fuel efficiency.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID S. CLOUD  </div><div>1261 words</div><div>17 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force has conducted more than 2,000 airstrikes in Afghanistan over the past six months, a sharp increase in bombing that reflects the growing demand for American air cover since NATO has assumed a larger ground combat role, Air Force officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intensifying air campaign has focused on southern Afghanistan, where NATO units, primarily from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands, as well as American Special Forces have been engaging in the heaviest and most frequent ground combat with Taliban rebels since the invasion five years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NATO forces are mostly operating without heavy armor or artillery support, and as Taliban resistance has continued, more air support has been used to compensate for the lightness of the units, Air Force officials said. Most of the strikes have come during ''close air support'' missions, where the bombers patrol the area and respond to calls from ground units in combat rather than performing planned strikes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent 11-hour mission that included a reporter for The New York Times, a B-1 bomber circled at 20,000 feet, responding to radio calls from American and Canadian troops who asked the plane to use its radar to watch for insurgent forces and to be prepared to drop bombs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a separate mission last week, a bomber dropped its entire payload of eight 2,000-pound bombs and six 500-pound bombs after ground units called for help, Air Force officials said. One B-1 pilot, Lt. Col. Tim Schepper, said that when troops called for airstrikes, ''There are times when you can hear the gunfire and R.P.G.'s over the radio in the background, and that's when you know you have helped keep them alive.'' An R.P.G. is a rocket-propelled grenade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To carry out the heavier mission load, the Air Force's entire complement of B-1 bombers was shifted over the summer from the British air base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to a Middle Eastern airfield closer to Afghanistan. The new arrangement shortens the flying time to Afghanistan by two hours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Air Force officials said they were prohibited from disclosing the location because of sensitivities by the host country about disclosing the extent of its cooperation with the American military.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lt. Gen. David Richards, the British commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, has promised to win support among Afghan civilians by focusing on economic development and avoiding combat. But the resurgence of the Taliban has made that difficult. NATO forces have established numerous small bases and sent out extended patrols with little or no heavy armor and artillery. NATO has also lacked a reserve force that can be shifted quickly to hot spots, though Poland has promised to send troops to fill that role.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2,095 attacks by American aircraft since June is many times greater than the number of airstrikes in Iraq, where the terrain and nature of the conflict are less susceptible to bombing campaigns. There have been only 88 attacks by American aircraft in Iraq since June, according to Air Force figures. Unlike in Afghanistan, insurgents in Iraq are largely in urban areas and do not often mass in groups large enough to warrant the use of airstrikes, Air Force commanders said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in total munitions dropped has also been substantial. This year in Afghanistan, American aircraft have dropped 987 bombs and fired more than 146,000 cannon rounds and bullets in strafing runs, more than was expended in both categories from the beginning of the American-led invasion in 2001 through 2004, the Air Force said. During those years, a total of 848 bombs and just over 119,000 bullets were used by aircraft, according to Air Force figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the B-1 flight last week that included a reporter, Colonel Schepper and his two-man crew received a radio call from a Canadian soldier at an isolated base near the town of Tarin Kowt, who asked the aircraft to stand by for potential attacks on insurgent forces. A few hours later, the bomber crew received a similar radio message from an American Special Forces soldier, who warned that Taliban attacks on his position had been frequent. ''We've had contact every day this week,'' said the soldier, who could not be identified under military rules. ''As sure as the day is long, we'll have more.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in recent airstrikes coincided with NATO moving into the south over the summer, a period when Taliban attacks also increased. Much of the bombing in September was conducted during several major NATO ground operations against concentrations of Taliban fighters. But the number of air attacks has stayed high, reaching 397 in October, and is expected to remain at comparable levels this month, according to Air Force commanders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Afghanistan the increased use of air power has also come at a cost in casualties among allied forces and civilians. In September, an American A-10 attack jet mistakenly opened fire on Canadian troops southwest of Kandahar, killing one and wounding dozens more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that month, a nighttime NATO air attack involving an AC-130 gunship killed 31 civilians, most of whom were shepherds, a joint NATO and Afghan investigation concluded recently. The civilians were killed as they fled their tents with their wives and children after a NATO bomb struck a nearby compound, killing 20 Taliban fighters. There have also been increased reports of damage or destruction to mosques and other civilian buildings and property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to dropping bombs, Air Force jets are increasingly being called on to provide ground forces with intelligence about possible insurgent forces in their vicinity, using infrared cameras, radar and other surveillance equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the B-1 has proven useful in Afghanistan because of its large fuel tanks and bomb-carrying capacity, the planes' 30-year-old electronics have sometimes been a liability.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the recent 11-hour mission, the B-1 crew had to inform ground troops several times that the plane's radar could not deliver the detailed picture of ground activity they wanted and that many fighter jets and other aircraft equipped with more modern surveillance equipment could provide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the mission, one American soldier called up to say that his unit was holding a memorial ceremony for a soldier who had been killed several days earlier in combat. Trying to detect any possible ambushes of the service, he asked whether the plane could see whether there were any ''military-age males'' with weapons nearby -- a request beyond the capabilities of the B-1's electronics, the crew told him. So he requested that the B-1 perform a ''show of force,'' a low-level pass meant to frighten any fighters nearby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Schepper dropped the jet steeply from 20,000 feet to around 8,000 feet and roared over the soldiers' position, releasing flares to heighten the effect of the fly-by.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plane's radio, the soldier voiced a simple response: ''Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DON PHILLIPS and NICOLA CLARK; Don Phillips reported from Washington and Nicola Clark from Paris.   </div><div>360 words</div><div>16 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 -- The United States filed an updated complaint on Wednesday with the World Trade Organization against European government spending on Airbus, warning that the plane maker would break international rules if it accepted aid to build its new wide-body A350.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complaint is the latest step in the continuing failure of the United States and Europe to negotiate a settlement to a bitter trans-Atlantic trade dispute. Boeing and Airbus are challenging one another at the W.T.O., each saying the other gets improper government subsidies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today, the United States filed a brief with the W.T.O. that demonstrates that subsidization of Airbus aircraft by the European Union, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom is inconsistent with W.T.O. rules,'' said Gretchen Hamel, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative in Washington.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she said, ''Let me be clear that we are willing to negotiate.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The filing was largely procedural, Ms. Hamel said, meeting a deadline that now sets Feb. 9 for a reply from Airbus, a unit of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking forward to the day when the E.U. makes its own filing and all the facts are on the table,'' said Rainer Ohler, a spokesman for Airbus. ''This is long overdue.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The negotiation remains snagged on the question of what is a permissible subsidy under W.T.O. rules. Boeing says the only major issue to be settled is subsidies for developing new aircraft, known as launch aid. Boeing says Airbus has received large amounts of government money for new planes. That aid must be repaid when the aircraft begins selling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Union says Boeing receives its own government aid through military contracts and local tax breaks. Boeing rejects those claims and refuses to trade them for launch aid in the negotiations. ''The one point that stands out is launch aid, which is a multibillion-dollar advantage unique to Airbus,'' a Boeing spokesman, Richard Dalton, said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calverton -- IT has been 12 years since Northrop Grumman left a 2,900-acre block of flat, breezy land here, where F-14s and other United States Navy aircraft were once built and tested. Today, planes carrying sky divers take off and land on a leftover two-mile runway.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land is now owned by the Town of Riverhead, which is actively seeking to have it developed. A number of ambitious proposals have been disclosed, but except for a few businesses that have moved into refurbished hangars on the property, no major development has taken place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site remains an open swath of overgrown grasses and winding taxiways and runways, surrounded by a buffer of pitch pine and autumn-burnished scrub oak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the plans have been out of the ordinary, like one developer's proposal to excavate two lakes for a water skiing park, and negotiations for a year-round 70-acre $36 million indoor and outdoor amusement park. Construction actually started on the water park but stalled when workers mistakenly hit the drinking water aquifer. The amusement park has not yet gained final approval.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent news about the site, called the Enterprise Park at Calverton, is that the residential developer Pulte Homes cannot find a partner to build a hotel and conference center that were part of its plan for a 464-home golf course community on 755 acres, which Pulte proposed to acquire for $91 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, another developer, Ken Wilpon, proposed a similar community for that parcel in the northwest portion of the site, planning two golf courses and a hotel, according to the Riverhead deputy supervisor, Christopher Kent. But that deal ''never got finalized'' either, Mr. Kent said. ''Neither one of these deals has made it to contract.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town's plan for the overall site -- bounded by Route 25, River Road, Peconic Avenue and Manorville Road -- was drawn up in 1997. It focuses on recreational and industrial uses, including amusement parks and sports facilities. As part of it, the town is developing its own 60-acre park with ball fields and trails next to the abortive water-skiing park.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But obstacles, including road access and limited infrastructure, have stood in the way of the bigger projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994, Northrop acquired Grumman and announced that the company was leaving Calverton, where Grumman had leased land from the United States Navy for 40 years. Studies commissioned by the Department of Defense and the New York State Department of Economic Development explored new uses that would bring jobs and tax revenue to Riverhead. The Navy transferred the land to the town in 1998.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Town planners developed a comprehensive plan that turned the site into an urban renewal district, a New York State designation that gives the town control over how the land is used once it is sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, the town created a new zoning code, called the recreational park district zone, which permits five types of development: sports parks; theme parks; light industrial; open space, which includes golf courses with ''accessory housing''; and hotel and convention centers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 755-acre site, Pulte originally proposed building 464 homes for people 55 and older, as well as a golf course, a clubhouse and a hotel and conference center. At the time, Marriott showed interest in developing the hotel part of the project, according to Michael Kelly, vice president for land acquisitions at Pulte.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recently, both Marriott and Starwood, the owner of a number of other hotel brands, which Pulte had also approached, have indicated that the plan is ''a very good idea whose time is not yet ripe,'' Mr. Kelly said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the advent of offices and light industrial businesses planned for an unsold 150-acre piece of the site bordering Route 25, Mr. Kelly said, there is no market to support a hotel and conference center. A revised plan ''would try to carve out a section where we think the hotel would be situated and buy that land at a later date,'' Mr. Kelly added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town has made some progress in industrial development next to the 755-acre parcel. In 2001, it sold 500 acres between two runways to Jan Burman, president of Engel Burman Group, a developer based in East Meadow. Mr. Burman has sold 200 acres to businesses, including a cement company and a custom window and door manufacturer, and is talking to other light manufacturers about the remaining acreage, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riverhead town supervisor, Phil Cardinale, said the Pulte proposal ''could be collapsing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's fair to say that the town is very willing to review a revised offer,'' Mr. Cardinale said, ''but if the revised offer excludes the hotel and conference center, it would be less attractive.'' A major hotel would be expected to generate a great deal of tax revenue and bring jobs to the area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revised offer from Pulte might also reduce the cost per acre that it would pay, since the 50 acres intended for a hotel and conference center are considered more valuable than the remaining 705 acres, Mr. Cardinale added. If the new plan ''diminishes the per-acre cost of what they are buying,'' he said, ''it would be less attractive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the old plan or a revised one, the town would also have to grant Pulte a zoning change to build more homes than are allowed under the current open-space rules.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least two of the four board members (Mr. Cardinale has the fifth vote) don't think the site should have any residential development, which puts a strain on town services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just don't think housing should be placed out there,'' said John Dunleavy, a board member, who said one other board member agreed with him. The Town Board has not yet seen the Pulte plan, he said, but he opposes a new subdivision. ''It's not going to bring jobs to the town of Riverhead,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other proposals for the 755-acre parcel include a Nascar racetrack and entertainment complex that the Long Island company TopGun Entertainment will present to the Town Board at the end of November. TopGun drew hundreds of people to public meetings in nearby Yaphank last winter to discuss development of county-owned land near the county jail but later seemed to shift its attention to Calverton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European company has also been in touch with Town Hall proposing an Olympic training center, Mr. Cardinale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a problem with proposals that would attract thousands of people is access from local roads. From Exit 71 on the Long Island Expressway, traffic would wind along two-lane Edwards Avenue to River Road, a narrow, curving road that leads to the south entrance. Another route would take cars through the sensitive pine barrens, long a source of battles between developers and environmentalists concerned about forested East End land and the impact of development on the drinking water aquifer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's great,'' Mr. Cardinale said of the proposals for a race track, training center or stadium, ''but tell me how you're going to get the people onto the site.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars Global Surveyor has been out of contact with Earth for nearly a week, and engineers tried to re-establish communication with the craft, which may be showing its age after 10 years in space. The agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., lost contact with the surveyor for two days last week, then received a weak carrier signal with no data on Sunday. Since then, the craft has not confirmed receiving a command to point one of its transmitters to Earth, Tom Thorpe, the project manager, said. The craft was launched on Nov. 7, 1996, to map Mars while orbiting the planet. It has operated longer than the other Martian exploration craft.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Foreign Sales by U.S. Arms Makers Doubled in a Year  </span>
</div><div class="author">By LESLIE WAYNE  </div><div>1268 words</div><div>11 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of military weapons by United States contractors to foreign governments doubled in the last year, as countries like Pakistan, Australia and Greece stepped up purchases of armaments and the United States government loosened policies to allow more American weapons to be sold on the world market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of $21 billion in arms sales agreements were signed from September 2005 to September 2006, compared with $10.6 billion in the previous year, according to new data compiled by the Pentagon. Foreign military sales agreements have typically ranged from $10 billion to $13 billion a year since 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors are behind the surge in sales. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration has used arms sales as a way to reward allies and cement international relationships. Middle Eastern countries, flush with oil revenues, have become big buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countries like India, Pakistan and Indonesia that were once barred from buying American weapons have had those bans lifted, and some have placed big orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For military contractors, the sales have provided a welcome source of new revenue at a time when the Pentagon has indicated that the era of record military budgets is ending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because many of the weapons sold overseas are mature products, the profit margins to American arms makers are high, since the initial development costs have long been recuperated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the case of some planes, like the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet and the C-17 Globemaster cargo plane, foreign military sales are a way to keep open production lines that might close for lack of Pentagon orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been a remarkable number of orders placed,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jeffries &amp; Company. ''It's another arrow in the quiver of military contractors.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest orders was placed by Pakistan, which had been barred from buying most American weapons because of its nuclear program. That ban was lifted last year and the country placed a $5 billion order for advanced F-16 jets made by the Lockheed Martin Corporation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar ban on India was also lifted, opening up a potentially lucrative market to American contractors. India is currently looking to buy up to 126 new fighter jets, and American contractors have been flying to India to show off their wares.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil profits are also behind some of the orders. Saudi Arabia said in July that it planned to spend $5.8 billion on American weapons to modernize its National Guard and will also put in more than $3 billion in orders for Black Hawk helicopters, Abrams and Bradley armored land vehicles, new radio systems and other weapons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the gulf region, Bahrain, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have filed plans to buy Black Hawk helicopters -- for a total of $1 billion. Oman plans to buy a $48 million anti-tank missile system. The Emirates plans to buy rocket artillery equipment and military trucks for $752 million and Bahrain will purchase Javelin missiles for $42 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bahrain alone has accounted for $1 billion in foreign military sales in the five years since 9/11.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rise in oil prices has allowed countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to increase their arms purchases dramatically,'' said William Hartung, director of the arms trade project at the World Policy Institute, which is part of the New School in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For contractors, Mr. Hartung added, these sales ''are a welcome windfall, not just icing on the cake.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new big gulf region orders, like the Saudi deal, were not included in the $21 billion tally for 2006. They will be carried over into the 2007 tally and are a sign that next year will be as robust as this one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a good start on 2007,'' said Lt. Gen. Jeffrey B. Kohler, director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which manages foreign military sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Pakistan and India, since 9/11, bans on arms sales have been lifted on Tajikistan, Serbia and Montenegro, Armenia and Azerbaijan as these countries have been identified by the State Department as critical allies in the war on terror. They have turned into buyers, although on a much smaller scale than the big Pakistani or Saudi orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan had no American arms purchases before 9/11. But as a group, they have bought $32 million in weapons under the foreign military sales program, according to statistics from the Center for Defense Information.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign military sales are negotiated directly between the United States and other governments and are overseen by the State Department, the Pentagon and Congress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other strategically situated countries have also stepped up their purchases. Nepal, for instance, bought $1.1 million of American weapons in the full decade before 9/11, and $22 million in the five years since.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Yemen, Djibouti and Uzbekistan bought $16.4 million combined in the decade before 9/11, and $73 million of American weapons since.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Foreign military sales are a good hedge against potential further cuts in Pentagon procurement,'' said Mark T. Esper, executive vice president for defense and international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call with analysts, Christopher E. Kubasik, chief financial officer of Lockheed, estimated that foreign sales account for 15 percent -- or $5.5 billion -- of Lockheed's sales, which were $37 billion in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're valued customers, and we plan to continue to grow in that area,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign sales have importance to military contractors beyond the dollar value of the contract. Once a country buys a weapon system, it will need to continue to buy spare parts or upgrades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the next couple of years,'' said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Company, ''foreign sales as a percentage of company revenues will be tracking up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign sales can also keep endangered weapons programs alive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, when Boeing made some announcements that it might begin to close production of its C-17 cargo line, Canada and Australia quickly stepped in to place orders: Canada's deal is valued at $1.3 billion and Australia's at $2 billion. Orders for the F-16 from Turkey, Greece and Pakistan are pumping $11 billion into that program at a time when the Air Force is phasing out of it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, the Aerospace Industries Association has been pressing Congress to relax rules so more foreign deals can be done outside of government scrutiny -- an effort that has, so far, been rebuffed in Congress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the industry association, along with representatives from the Boeing Company and the Northrop Grumman Corporation, met at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington research group, to outline their plans to pursue this effort.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: Pakistan placed a $5 billion order for F-16 jets, above, made by the Lockheed Martin Corporation. Turkey and Greece also placed orders. (Photo by Pakistan Air Force, via European Pressphoto Agency)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Weapons Sales Rise''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of agreements to sell United States military equipment to foreign governments rose sharply last year. The amount was bolstered by major sales, including one to Pakistan, which previously had been barred from purchases.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force awarded a lucrative contract for search-and-rescue combat helicopters to a team led by Boeing. Boeing beat out rival Lockheed Martin and helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft for the contract to build 141 helicopters by 2019 for the Air Force's fleet of rescue aircraft, known as the Combat Search and Rescue program. The initial contract award is for $712 million; the program may be worth as much as $13 billion. The helicopters will be built at Boeing's plant in Ridley Park, Pa., near Philadelphia. About 200 new engineering jobs will be created initially, with more jobs expected as production moves forward. There are about 4,800 employees in Ridley Park, a Boeing spokesman, Joseph LaMarca Jr., said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov. 9 -- The space shuttle Discovery was moved to the launching pad on Thursday to await a liftoff that could be as early as Dec. 7, an effort to avoid potential New Year's Eve computer glitches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worry is that shuttle computers are not designed to make the change from the 365th day of the old year to the first day of the new one while in flight. NASA has never had a shuttle in space on Dec. 31 or Jan. 1.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By ANDREW E. KRAMER </div><div>679 words</div><div>10 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW, Nov. 9 -- The chief executive of Aeroflot, Russia's national airline, said Thursday that the carrier had missed a deadline to buy Boeing's new 787 passenger plane in time to meet its goals for renewing its fleet. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government-controlled board deliberated for too long in choosing between the Boeing plane and a competing model offered by Airbus, said the chief executive of Aeroflot, Valery M. Okulov, according to the Interfax news agency. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadline for buying Boeing jets for delivery by 2010 expired on Nov. 1, according to an outspoken minority shareholder in Aeroflot, but Boeing and Aeroflot had not commented publicly on a possible breakdown of the deal until Thursday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus and Boeing have been in a long-running battle over aircraft orders, a contest Airbus has been losing elsewhere -- but not in Russia -- because of production delays for its A350 jet. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, everything at Boeing has been bought up until 2014 and we can't buy anything,'' Mr. Okulov said during a trip to China Thursday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Boeing spokeswoman said the company did not comment on negotiations. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still working with Aeroflot,'' Olga Y. Kostrubina, the spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. ''It's not yet over. We still believe that the 787 is the best airplane for Russia.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian aircraft industry is trying to join Airbus's parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, as a partner, a reason analysts cited for its dragging out the decision on badly needed upgrades to the Aeroflot fleet. Buying Airbus planes would seem to dovetail with this effort. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Airbus A350s, now being redesigned to better compete with the 787, will not be ready in time to meet Aeroflot's ambitious expansion plans. Asked whether Aeroflot would rely on the new A350s, Mr. Okulov said that Airbus had ''not yet confirmed its production program,'' according to Interfax. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale has also become tied up in Russia's efforts to revive its domestic aircraft industry in other ways. The government was holding out on the sale to encourage Boeing and Airbus to invest in Russian factories, which both companies did. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently, for example, Boeing created a joint venture with a Russian titanium smelter in August to make 787 parts. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strategy of leveraging the sale for other industrial or political goals was pushed too far, according to Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a billionaire owner of 30 percent of Aeroflot. Now, it seems Aeroflot has lost its chance to get a good price on new airplanes from either company, he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airline, once the world's largest, could be left with too few planes for long-haul routes to North and South America and Asia, and be forced to cut back on flights. Mr. Lebedev has threatened to sue the government for leaving Aeroflot without enough planes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would advise Boeing not to be in such a hurry,'' to sell the planes it had reserved for Aeroflot to another buyer, he said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing, he said, would lose some money if it sold to Aeroflot under the previous contract terms, but would gain entry to Russia's market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They should be willing to pay something for strategic gain,'' Mr. Lebedev said. ''If the Russian market is a strategic gain for them, they should not be eager to sell the airplanes to somebody else.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official to Head Company's Board </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW, Nov. 9 (AP) -- Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, will head the board of a new state-controlled aircraft corporation aimed at reinvigorating the nation's aviation industry, news agencies reported Thursday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Vladimir V. Putin approved the move at a meeting to discuss plans for the holding company, the United Aircraft Corporation, according to Interfax, ITAR-Tass and RIA-Novosti.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felony gun possession charges against the rappers Lloyd Banks and Young Buck of the group G-Unit, arrested last year after a concert at Madison Square Garden, were dropped yesterday. The police said Lloyd Banks, whose real name is Christopher Lloyde, and Young Buck, whose real name is David Brown, were in a van with several other men when it ran a red light in Midtown. Officers who stopped the van discovered a loaded handgun and another weapon inside. Prosecutors asked a Criminal Court judge yesterday to dismiss charges against Mr. Lloyde and Mr. Brown after an investigation determined that neither possessed the weapons, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT, Nov. 7 -- FedEx canceled an order for 10 Airbus A380s on Tuesday, becoming the first customer to abandon the European superjumbo jet in the wake of production delays that have shaken the company. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The order will instead go to its American rival Boeing, which will supply FedEx with 15 Boeing 777 freighters, a plane also designed for long-haul cargo flights. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick W. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of FedEx, faced with a rapidly growing cargo market, cited Airbus's recent decision to delay delivery of the superjumbo jet for at least two years as the reason for shifting its order to Boeing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a watershed event,'' said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst with Jeffries &amp; Company. FedEx was ''meticulous, thoughtful and analytical when they made their decision to buy the A380. They are an ideal lead customer, and for them to turn around in relatively short time and pull out is a stunning reversal.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rubel noted that this was the first time in a decade that FedEx would buy new Boeing planes. One reason, he suggested, was Boeing's ability to deliver the 777 as early as 2009, as well as the flexibility of the twin-engine long-haul plane for many different routes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FedEx also dropped its options for the purchase of 10 A380s at an unspecified date in the future. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation goes beyond a dollar loss. Because FedEx has a reputation for careful decision-making, the switch bolsters the reputation of the 777 at a time when the market for long-haul international cargo planes is growing faster than the international passenger market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like the 777 just got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval,'' Mr. Rubel added. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until FedEx abandoned the A380, Airbus had 159 firm orders for the plane. Far more orders are needed for Airbus to break even, much less earn profits. In the past, Airbus has said it expected to sell about 750 planes -- the A380 will be the largest commercial jet ever built, seating at least 555 passengers -- during the life of the program. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the FedEx contract for Airbus was confidential, but the passenger version of the A380 lists for about $300 million. Airbus may not lose as much as $3 billion in revenues from the order, though; freighters sell for less because their interiors are not as elaborate. Moreover, the FedEx order was placed at rates that would have prevailed in 2001, an Airbus spokeswoman, Barbara Kracht, said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other customers could follow FedEx's lead, however. Virgin Atlantic Airways, another major customer, said less than two weeks ago that it was postponing for four years its order for six Airbus A380s, making it the first airline to step back from its commitment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus has also been jousting with its largest customer, Emirates Airlines, which last month sent teams to Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany, the main Airbus production sites, to look into its orders for 43 planes. A second team of Emirates engineers is expected to arrive in Toulouse later this month to study the progress of A380s there. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of Airline Monitor, a commercial aviation trade publication, said he doubted other airliners would follow suit. Mr. Greenslet pointed to the decision late last month by Qantas Airways of Australia to convert its options to purchase eight A380s into firm orders. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think that this will start a landslide and cause other airlines to say, 'Well, if FedEx is canceling, I will, too,' '' said Mr. Greenslet. ''Other airlines have made their own judgment and are basically committed to the plane.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation by FedEx means that Airbus now has outstanding orders for just 15 freighter versions of the A380. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United Parcel Service ordered 10 A380s in 2005 and has options to buy 10 more. The remaining five will go to the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing company based in California. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for U.P.S., Mark Giuffre, said that the company was in regular contact with Airbus about its A380 orders and had yet to make a final decision about whether to modify or cancel them. U.P.S., which had originally expected to receive its first A380 in September 2009 has been told by Airbus that the first delivery will not be made before the middle of 2010. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are asking for more detailed information from Airbus before making any decisions,'' said Mr. Giuffre. ''We are not making any changes to our order for now, but as a business, we have to be prudent in making sure that we can meet the needs of our customers over the long term.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus announced its first delay for the A380 last year, because of problems with wiring in the planes built at its factory in Germany. In June, Airbus announced another delay and appointed a new chief executive, who then stepped down in October. He had begun laying the groundwork for a cost-cutting program aimed at shaving 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) from annual costs. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To achieve that goal, Airbus plans to reduce the number of suppliers it uses to 500, from 3,000, though that shift will affect general procurement of things like office supplies and furniture rather than aircraft parts. Thousands of jobs are also at stake. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Airbus in the deepest crisis of its 36-year history, some analysts say it will be difficult for the company to obtain many more new orders for the A380. Airbus, the main subsidiary of the European Aeronautic, Space and Defense Company, said it regretted the FedEx decision. ''That said, we respect their need to address capacity growth,'' an Airbus spokesman, David Voskuhl, said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing, meanwhile, enjoys new success for its 777, the world's longest-range twin engine aircraft. It will replace FedEx's aging fleet of McDonnell Douglas-11F cargo jets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Conner, vice president of sales for the Americas at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said, ''We're looking forward to working with FedEx on this new chapter in our relationship.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government and Maoist rebels appeared close to reaching an agreement to lock up both sides' weapons, a major hurdle in the continuing peace talks. The Maoists would contain their armed cadres in designated areas and keep their arms in locked storage. The rebels would keep the keys to their locked weapons, but remain under closed-circuit monitoring by United Nations officials. The Nepali Army would also be obliged to lock up an equal number of weapons. A parliamentary committee would be appointed to recommend military reform. The Maoists want to integrate their fighters into a new Nepali Army. TILAK P. POKHAREL (NYT)  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families of the victims of Brazil's worst air disaster filed a federal lawsuit yesterday against the operator and maker of a business jet that crossed paths with a commercial airliner, which crashed and killed 154 people. The families listed the operator, ExcelAire Service Inc. of Ronkonkoma, and the manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc., as defendants in the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court. A spokeswoman for ExcelAire, Lisa Henrickson, said the company was preparing a reply. A Honeywell spokesman, Bill Reavis, said that the company would not comment because it had not seen the lawsuit. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said the Sept. 29 crash resulted when the executive jet, flown by two New York pilots, collided with a Boeing 737 operated by Gol Airlines, which plunged into the Amazon rainforest. Although the crash damaged the smaller jet's wing and tail, it landed safely.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the Hubble Space Telescope was in the news, it had been figuratively tied to the railroad tracks and left for dead by Sean O'Keefe, then the NASA administrator. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the wreck of the space shuttle Columbia, Mr. O'Keefe, who even had a mustache suitable for diabolical twirling, declared an end to the astronaut service calls that had kept the Hubble eye alive and on its game, all but ensuring that its string of matchless cosmic postcards would cease by the end of the decade. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, night was already falling. A main instrument, a spectrograph, stopped operating two years ago. The main camera stopped working for two weeks this fall. The telescope has been limping along on two of the six gyroscopes that provide pointing and stability in an effort to harbor reserves for the long years ahead. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. O'Keefe's successor, Michael D. Griffin, sprung the Hubble from the rails, announcing that he would send an astronaut crew in spring 2008 to rejuvenate the telescope one more time. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision ensures that if all goes well, the Hubble will continue to send back those postcards long after the space shuttles that launched and nurtured it have been trucked to the bone yards and the museums. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles are scheduled to be retired in 2010 to make way for the Crew Exploration Vehicle that will take people back to the Moon and onward to Mars. But with refurbishing, the telescope will work until at least 2013, astronomers say, and will remain in orbit until 2021 or beyond. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is appropriate that the telescope will be the last robot standing in what has been a long and tense marriage between science and the space truck. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before the shuttle was a glean in NASA's eye -- long before NASA even existed -- there was the idea of a space telescope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late Princeton astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed way back in 1946 that a telescope in space would free astronomers from the curse of looking through air, which distorts and blurs images and blocks many forms of radiation from the heavens. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope has endured a Perils of Pauline existence. In the early 1970s, advocates of the telescope hooked their dreams to the planned space shuttle, designing the Hubble to be launched into a relatively low orbit that the shuttle could reach and to be serviced by astronauts and even retrieved back to the ground, a demonstration of the glories of the new era in manned spaceflight. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan was not popular among many scientists who thought that the shuttle was a boondoggle, that the telescope should be higher so that the Earth would not block so much of its view and that it would be cheaper to build if it did not have to be repaired by someone wearing boxing gloves. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was clear, said John Bahcall, the late Princeton astrophysicist who was deeply involved in the telescope his whole life, that if the telescope did not go on the shuttle, the telescope would not go at all. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an imperfect marriage,'' he said in an interview two years ago. ''The shuttle was the only bride available.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a Catch-22 in which NASA justified the shuttle by its ability to support scientific projects like the telescope and then justified cutting the science budget to pay for the shuttle. The telescope was nearly canceled several times in the '70s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like every Big Science project in recent memory, the telescope was oversold and underfinanced, and so its manufacturer, Perkin-Elmer, skipped an expensive and risky test that would have revealed that the telescope could not be focused because its main mirror was polished to the wrong shape. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of the telescope's launching in April 1990, 14 years after Congress approved it, it had cost $2 billion. The NASA public relations machine, which had been gearing up for years for that moment, called it ''the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, when the blur was discovered, the telescope was a national joke. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, who is a staunch space supporter from Maryland -- home of the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute -- called it a ''techno turkey.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a do-or-die 11-day mission in December 1993, spacewalking astronauts from the shuttle Endeavour corrected the vision of the telescope. Their achievment, which vindicated the idea of astronaut maintenance, and the construction of the space station, as well, was probably the high point of the space shuttle program. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, astronauts have visited the Hubble three more times, replacing the precious gyroscopes as they failed and installing a succession of more and more sensitive instruments, and the Hubble has gradually begun living up to its original hype. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has recorded the deepest telescopic image made, showing galaxies as they existed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. The instrument has shown the presence of monstrous black holes in the milky hearts of galaxies and discerned the first push of dark energy beginning to accelerate the universe five billion years ago. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this make the Hubble a more important instrument than the Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson, which Edwin Hubble used to discover the expansion of the universe, or the 200-inch Hale Telescope on Palomar Mountain, with which astronomers discovered quasars and began to gauge the scale and fate of the universe? I don't know. For sure, the Hubble is the first big space telescope and the first celebrity telescope of the Internet age. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of the Hubble and its amazing images, Sandra Faber, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said a few years ago, ''We're addicted.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, NASA's then administrator Daniel S. Goldin warned astronomers in 1999 to stop ''hugging Hubble,'' lest their affection and the expense of keeping it aloft and well interfered with developing new telescopes and new missions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public is also addicted, not least because of a group of astronomers known as the Hubble Heritage Project, who have applied artistic principles to process the Hubble images into romantic spacescapes. In the best of their work, like ''Pillars of Creation,'' showing star-forming clouds in the Eagle nebula, space takes on the majesty of Western landscapes by artists like Albert Bierstadt. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, the Hubble became the people's telescope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Keefe tried to walk away from the telescope two years ago, saying it was too risky to send astronauts anywhere but the space station. He later conceded to Steven Dick, a NASA historian, that he had never conducted a formal risk analysis. To Mr. O'Keefe's surprise, the public and Congress would not let him abandon the Hubble. Schoolchildren volunteered to send their pennies to NASA to help pay for a service mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's public relations machine had done its work too well. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Keefe then considered sending a robot to repair the Hubble, only to find that many astronomers were wary of a machine tending their telescope. They wanted astronauts, and the National Academy of Sciences concurred. The idea died, seemingly dooming the Hubble. But then Mr. O'Keefe stepped down a year and a half ago to become the chancellor at Louisiana State University. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin, who took over as administrator, is a real rocket scientist -- Mr. O'Keefe had been a business professor and management expert -- and had said from the beginning that he was willing to reconsider the fate of the telescope. But he has been under fire from the scientific community lately for his willingness to cut and delay science missions to finish the space station and start President Bush's Moon Mars program. In September in a typically blunt speech at the Goddard Space Center, Dr. Griffin scolded scientists for expecting to have too much of a say over what the space agency does, and even accused them of having a conflict of interest. Last week at the same center, however, the scientists gave him a standing ovation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, the Hubble has returned from the brink. At least one more time, the astronauts will return in their homely patched-up chariot. Like ghosts of a Christmas future that never quite jelled -- none of the three subsequent ''Great Observatories'' were designed for astronaut servicing -- the astronomer knights of the shuttle will ride the robot arm, lugging their Buck Rogers wrenches, and clamber up the shiny flanks of the telescope; they will literally hug the Hubble. </p>

</div><div class="author">By MATTHEW L. WALD  </div><div>529 words</div><div>5 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every space shuttle flight has its risks, as two catastrophes have made painfully clear, but the one announced last week by NASA to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope in 2008 is riskier than usual. If the shuttle runs into trouble, it won't be able to rendezvous with the International Space Station for help. The best it could do is collide with it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons have to do with physics and politics, which led the United States and Russia to set the orbits of the Hubble telescope and the space station at different angles to the Equator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the physics. Decades ago, the United States built its main launching pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., almost as far south as possible, to make it easier for its space vehicles to achieve orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a rock thrown from a speeding car, a spacecraft launched from a low latitude gets a push from the earth's rotation -- 1,000 miles an hour at the Equator, tapering to zero at the poles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble was launched there in 1990 at an angle of 28.5 degrees from the Equator, the lowest angle easily achievable from Cape Canaveral. The minimum angle of orbit equals the latitude of the launch point, and Cape Canaveral is at 28.5 degrees north.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the politics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station was built in a historic partnership with the Russians. As part of the arrangement, the United States agreed that the station would orbit at an angle of 51.6 degrees from the equator. The orbit was chosen so that the Russians could launch components and crews from their site at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, at latitude 45.9 degrees north, to build and service the Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for the 11-day mission planned for 2008 is that the shuttle will have to be launched at an angle of 28.5 degrees to match the Hubble's orbit. Once the shuttle is launched, though, it will be all but impossible for the spacecraft to change its orbit to detour to the space station in the event of trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible for the shuttle to change its altitude to match the altitude of the space station. But a successful rendezvous would require the relative motion of the two spacecraft to be zero. And because the angles of their orbits are different, the two craft would cross paths at several miles per second. Disaster would ensue. MATTHEW L. WALD  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''IT'S ROCKET SCIENCE''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once an object is launched into orbit, changing the angle at which it crosses the Equator is very difficult. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched at 28.5 degrees, the easiest angle possible from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Launching at low angles minimizes the amount of rocket thrust needed to achieve orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station is at 51.6 degrees, the standard launch angle used by Russia at Baikonur, Kazakhstan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORBIT ANGLE OF SPACE STATION: 51.6degrees FROM EQUATOR  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORBIT ANGLE OF THE HUBBLE: 28.5degrees FROM EQUATOR  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An editorial slated to appear Monday in four newspapers aimed at military readers calls for Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld to be replaced, because, it argues, ''his strategy has failed'' in Iraq and ''his ability to lead is compromised,'' an executive with the newspaper said. ''We say it's time for him to go,'' said Tobias Naegele, the editor in chief of Army Times, which is running the editorial along with its sister publications, Air Force Times, Navy Times and Marine Corps Times. The newspapers are distributed mainly to service members and are published by a subsidiary of the Gannett Company. President Bush said this week that he wanted Mr. Rumsfeld to serve through the end of his term in 2008, and Pentagon officials have said that Mr. Rumsfeld has no intention of leaving. ''The president has made it clear that he wants the secretary of defense to serve for the rest of his term,'' Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said last night. DAVID S.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force has agreed to pay more than $500,000 to an Ocean County school that was mistakenly shot by an F-16 jet on a training maneuver two years ago, a congressman said yesterday. Under the settlement, the Air Force will pay $519,070 to the Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School, said the lawmaker, Representative Jim Saxton, who represents Ocean County. The building was damaged by 27 rounds of inert 20-millimeter ammunition. No one was injured. The military said that the pilot was at fault, but that poorly designed controls in the F-16 played a role.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency's finest scientific instrument escaped a death sentence yesterday when Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, approved a shuttle mission to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. It was a brave call, since repairing the Hubble will put the shuttle at greater risk than a typical mission to the International Space Station. It was also a welcome sign that NASA is willing to go the extra orbital mile to support superb science, even while it squanders large sums on completing the space station to perform research that can't begin to compare with the Hubble's in importance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade and a half, the Hubble has made discoveries that have helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Its typical role is to pick up a hint from ground-based telescopes and then use its unparalleled vantage point above the atmosphere to probe deeply into some puzzling phenomenon. The Hubble has peered farther into space and farther back in time than any other instrument. It has discovered more than 500 proto-galaxies that emitted light when the universe was in its formative stages, confirmed the jaw-dropping discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and helped establish the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel of distinguished astronomers judged that the Hubble ''has arguably had a greater impact on astronomy than any instrument since the original astronomical telescope of Galileo.'' And what made all of this possible was NASA's willingness to refurbish the Hubble every few years to replace depleted batteries and gyroscopes and install new equipment. Many experts believe that when the Hubble gets two state-of-the-art instruments on the next servicing mission in 2008 it will be more capable than ever, ready to peer farther back into a time when galaxies were forming and the universe was emerging from darkness into light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat to the Hubble's future came unexpectedly from NASA itself in early 2004. In a decision that can only be described as myopic, Sean O'Keefe, the administrator at the time, unexpectedly canceled the next servicing mission, ostensibly because of safety concerns after the Columbia disaster. But the underlying reason was almost certainly that a Hubble mission would be a diversion from the administration's priorities to complete the space station and then send astronauts back to the Moon and eventually Mars. Only intervention by Congress and the National Academy of Sciences kept the death sentence at bay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Griffin has concluded that the mission can be conducted safely, especially since NASA has developed new inspection and orbital repair techniques, and that the mission will not interfere with other space priorities. A Hubble mission may be marginally more risky than a flight to the space station, but that risk is surely worth taking for the scientific payoff.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREENBELT, Md., Oct. 31 -- NASA announced Tuesday that it would send space shuttle astronauts in 2008 to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, extending the life of one of its most valuable spacecraft on a mission once thought too risky to try. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Announcing the decision here at the Goddard Space Flight Center, a Hubble command post, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said the benefits of saving the celebrated telescope were worth the risks of sending astronauts to do the job. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-day mission, expected to cost about $900 million, is to lift off sometime between the spring and fall of 2008. A crew of seven, led by Scott D. Altman, who commanded the last Hubble repair mission in 2002, will capture the observatory in its 380-mile-high orbit and conduct five spacewalks to replace its aging batteries and stabilizing gyroscopes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the repairs, the telescope would die in orbit in two or three years. With them, it should continue operating until at least 2013. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While there is an inherent risk in all spaceflight activities,'' Dr. Griffin said, ''the desire to preserve a truly international asset like the Hubble Space Telescope makes doing this mission the right course of action.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His predecessor, Sean O'Keefe, provoked an outcry from scientists, politicians and the public in 2004 by canceling a scheduled fifth and final repair mission in the wake of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its crew. Mr. O'Keefe cited the risk to astronauts and the need to use the remaining shuttle flights to finish the International Space Station. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble telescope has been one of the most productive astronomical observatories ever built and the flagship of NASA's exploration of the universe. Orbiting far above Earth's obscuring atmosphere, it has sent back the clearest and deepest images of the universe ever seen. Those images have helped astronomers confirm the existence of black holes, determine the true age of the universe and spot dim galaxies born within the first billion years of the Big Bang. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to criticism of Mr. O'Keefe's decision, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration investigated using a robot to service the telescope. But a National Academy of Sciences advisory panel said that the chance of completing such a mission in time to save the observatory was remote and that a manned mission had a better chance of success. The committee also said the risks of a shuttle mission to the telescope were not significantly greater than those of a mission to the space station. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the station could serve as a refuge for the crew of a damaged shuttle. The telescope offers no such haven. So Dr. Griffin said that during the repair mission, a second shuttle would be ready to rescue the astronauts if needed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who led the fight in Congress to save the telescope, was at the announcement and praised the decision. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mikulski said the initial decision to abandon a repair mission was made at a time of grief, fear and indecision. She praised NASA for stepping back and getting a ''second opinion'' on canceling the mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. John M. Logsdon, head of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of a panel that investigated the Columbia accident, said the next repair mission should be safer than the previous four. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA is flying the shuttle with more care and has a greater capability to identify and fix problems than before,'' Dr. Logsdon said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger D. Launius, a historian with the National Air and Space Museum who closely follows NASA issues, said the decision could help improve Dr. Griffin's relations with scientists who have criticized him for reducing long-term spending on science programs to pay for new human space flight initiatives. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this case, he's shown a willingness to go to bat for science,'' Mr. Launius said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin worked on the space telescope earlier in his career and recently described it as ''one of the great scientific instruments of all time.'' Before his confirmation as NASA administrator a year and a half ago, he expressed a willingness to explore repairing the orbiting observatory, which is operated by the Goddard center and the Space Science Telescope Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two most serious issues facing the telescope are its batteries and gyroscopes. The gyroscopes help it turn and lock onto targets; the six batteries, which have never been replaced, keep it alive. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has flown three shuttle missions since the Columbia accident to test new safety modifications and resume building the space station, and agency officials said about a half dozen more flights would occur before the Hubble mission. Crews now routinely inspect the shuttle while in flight for the kind of damage that doomed the Columbia, and they carry rudimentary repair kits for fixing many heat shield problems that could bring down a shuttle. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about the ties of Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, to the Italian weapons manufacturer Finmeccanica misstated the Congressional district in which Oto Melara, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, is locating a plant. It will be in the part of Tinicum Township that is in the First Congressional District -- not in Mr. Weldon's Seventh Congressional District, which borders the site.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Nov 03 2006    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 -- In November at the five-star Hotel Splendido overlooking the harbor in Portofino, a playground of the Italian rich, Representative Curt Weldon was the center of attention.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Weldon was a main speaker at a conference sponsored in part by the Italian military giant Finmeccanica. At the gathering of Italian, British and American political leaders, Mr. Weldon, of Pennsylvania, spoke on behalf of Italian arms makers who were seeking a bigger share of Pentagon contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers paid for Mr. Weldon's stay. He received a $1,153 daily expense allowance from the federal government and flew over on a military jet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Weldon, the conference was a victory lap. After several years of promoting Italian military contractors, the Italians had scored some big victories at the Pentagon. But Mr. Weldon's efforts were equally beneficial for his district, his family, his friends and his campaign coffers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Italians may well have second thoughts about their embrace of Mr. Weldon, who has represented his suburban Philadelphia district since 1987 and is now the subject of a federal investigation into possible influence peddling and, as a result, is in a tight re-election race.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department is looking into whether he used his position to steer almost $1 million in consulting contracts from a Russian energy company and other Eastern European interests to a lobbying firm headed by his daughter Karen, 31. Her home and her office were searched two weeks ago by federal officials.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law enforcement officials said they were examining a wide variety of Mr. Weldon's connections with foreign companies, but they would not discuss whether the inquiry focused directly on Finmeccanica.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weldon's promotion of Finmeccanica, the largest military contractor in Italy, with annual revenue of $19 billion and 55,000 employees worldwide, has certainly helped the company as it sought to become as adept as its American counterparts in playing politics to gain lucrative Pentagon contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weldon, who has offices in Upper Darby and Bridgeport, Pa., declined to comment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Finmeccanica subsidiary, together with Lockheed Martin, upset an American competitor to land the $1.7 billion contract to build the next Marine One presidential helicopter. Other subsidiaries are now making headway in other Pentagon contests.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weldon's relationship with the Italians has been mutually beneficial. His daughter Kim, 29, a former social worker, was hired by AgustaWestland, the Finmeccanica subsidiary that won the Marine One contract, shortly after her father's speech in Portofino. Kim Weldon's work is to set up booths at trade shows and perform public relations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AgustaWestland said the timing was coincidental. Ms. Weldon, through a company spokesman, declined to comment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 10 Americans at Finmeccanica subsidiaries in the United States, along with their spouses, were among the biggest contributors to Mr. Weldon's campaign in 2006. Their combined donations of $20,400 edged out donations from American giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Finmeccanica subsidiary, Oto Melara, whose 76 Super Rapid gun Mr. Weldon has championed, last year hired his close friend Cecelia Grimes, a former real estate agent, and paid her $60,000 as a federal lobbyist. Ms. Grimes has no previous Washington lobbying experience and no Washington office.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was put in touch with Oto Melara by Mr. Weldon's chief of staff, Russ Caso. But, Ms. Grimes said in an interview, her employment was not because of Mr. Weldon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's ridiculous,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Grimes said she had introduced Oto Melara, which makes guns for ships and tanks, to companies in Mr. Weldon's district.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oto Melara defended its choice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We met her in a meeting in Philadelphia, and she made a good impression,'' a spokesman for the company said in Il Sole 24 Ore, a Milan newspaper. ''We felt she was the right person for us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finmeccanica, partly owned by the Italian government, has also expanded within Mr. Weldon's district and near it. In November, after winning the Marine One contract, AgustaWestland broke ground on a $27 million plant expansion in Northeast Philadelphia. In November 2004, Oto Melara chose Lester in the district over two others for its first major American site.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oto Melara selected its site as Mr. Weldon asked Navy officials to reconsider a decision to put a rival company's guns, instead of those from Oto Melara, on its new Littoral Combat Ships.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Congressman Weldon took immediate interest in our issue,'' Howard Goldberg, chief executive of Oto Melara North America, said in an interview with The Delaware County Daily Times in suburban Philadelphia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finmeccanica says that it has not been contacted by the Justice Department but that it is worried. In a letter last week to Il Sole 24 Ore, the company said about Mr. Weldon. ''The connection between the investigations related to the person and Finmeccanica is harmful to the image of the Finmeccanica Group.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter was signed by its media director, Simone Bemporad.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the company is not ready to cut its ties. A spokesman in New York, Gino Colangelo, said last week that ''we have a warm relationship'' with Mr. Weldon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That relationship has its critics among Pentagon watchdog groups.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Doesn't the congressman have to register as a foreign agent?'' asked Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, which studies Pentagon contracts. ''It's always disturbing when a member of Congress goes to bat for a particular company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is even more alarming when the company is foreign. When it comes to national security, you want the best products, not products from companies with a relationship to a member of Congress.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caso, the congressman's chief of staff, said Mr. Weldon's relations with the Italian companies had been misinterpreted. He said Mr. Weldon had long been an advocate for insourcing, in which foreign military contractors set up plants in the United States and provide employment. In addition, Mr. Weldon has argued that the Pentagon should scour the world for the best weapons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congressman's relationship with Finmeccanica grew out of this view, Mr. Caso said. For instance, Mr. Weldon has long been associated with Marine One. But he was far more interested in opening the competition to the Italians than in picking their helicopter, Mr. Caso said, adding that the Pentagon made the final decision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Curt Weldon was supportive of the Marine One bid, but in no way was he a key player in winning the competition,'' said E. Beau Boulter, a former Republican House member from Texas who lobbies for Finmeccanica.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boulter has earned $440,000 in the last three years from the company, and with his wife, has donated $11,400 to Mr. Weldon and his leadership political action committee in the last two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument that Mr. Weldon was motivated to help Finmeccanica to help his district or the Pentagon does not satisfy some Pentagon watchdogs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If anything, this all looks like quid pro quo,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which wrote a complaint to the Justice Department two years ago about Mr. Weldon. ''Weldon will help out, but it will cost. He has no affinity for the Italians, but for what they will pay. They hired his daughter and his friend, and that is the deal.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One favor that Mr. Weldon carried out for the Italians was to be the host at a conference here on March 30, 2004, at the request of the Italian Embassy. The Italians were promoting their Marine One bid and Finmeccanica's C-27J cargo plane as well as seeking more work from the Joint Strike Fighter program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Italian delegation included the chief executive of Finmeccanica, Pierfrancesco Guarguaglini, and top military officials. Mr. Weldon helped arrange for them to meet at the Rayburn House Office Building with Michael W. Wynne, who was the top weapons buyer at the Pentagon, and Douglas J. Feith, under secretary of defense for policy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also brought in were Harry C. Stonecipher and Vance D. Coffman, then chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed, respectively, two companies in positions to form partnerships and subcontracting deals with Italian companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Italian Embassy came to us,'' Mr. Caso, the Weldon aide, said. ''They were upset some of their contractors were not getting enough work.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more personal level, AgustaWestland, the helicopter subsidiary, said it had not sought out Kim Weldon. Mr. Colangelo, its spokesman, said she had answered an online employment advertisement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weldon, who had run a welcome center for immigrants in her father's district, was selected over five or six other applicants, Mr. Colangelo said, adding, ''She's one of our best employees.'' The company required her to agree to not lobby her father or other officials.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''AgustaWestland hired Kim Weldon at the end of a very competitive process,'' Mr. Bemporad of Finmeccanica wrote to Il Sole 24 Ore. ''Furthermore, the company adopted additional precautions -- following the same guidelines used by other companies in the United States in these situations -- limiting the work assigned to Ms. Weldon in an effort to prevent any apparent or real conflict of interest.''   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Russia Was Leader in Arms Sales to Developing World in '05  </span>
</div><div class="author">By THOM SHANKER  </div><div>897 words</div><div>29 October 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 -- Russia surpassed the United States in 2005 as the leader in weapons deals with the developing world, and its new agreements included selling $700 million in surface-to-air missiles to Iran and eight new aerial refueling tankers to China, according to a new Congressional study.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those weapons deals were part of the highly competitive global arms bazaar in the developing world that grew to $30.2 billion in 2005, up from $26.4 billion in 2004. It is a market that the United States has regularly dominated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's agreements with Iran are not the biggest part of its total sales -- India and China are its principal buyers. But the sales to improve Iran's air-defense system are particularly troubling to the United States because they would complicate the task of Pentagon planners should the president order airstrikes on Iran's nuclear weapons facilities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration has vowed a diplomatic solution in dealing with Iran. But as United Nations diplomats argue over potential sanctions against Iran for its nuclear ambitions, Russian officials have expressed reluctance to vote for the most stringent economic sanctions, partly owing to Moscow's extensive trade relations with Tehran.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's weapons sales to China also worry Pentagon planners. Although China has joined the United States in partnership to press for a resumption of six-party talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program after its recent test, Taiwan remains a potential flash point between Beijing and Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, China's ability to refuel its attack planes and bombers to enable them to fly farther from Chinese soil could require the United States Navy to operate even farther out to sea should the United States military be called to deal with a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. That would have an impact on the range and number of air missions of United States Navy aircraft launched from carriers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of the specific weapons deals in the global arms trade last year are included in an annual study by the Congressional Research Service that is considered the most thorough compilation of statistics available in an unclassified form. The report was delivered to members of Congress on Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other arms transfers described in the study was a statistic that a single, unnamed nation -- but one identified separately by Pentagon and other administration officials to be North Korea -- shipped about 40 ballistic missiles to other nations in the four-year period ending in 2005, the only nation to have done so. Transfers of these weapons are prohibited under international agreements to control the trade of ballistic missiles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United Nations sanctions passed earlier this month after the North Korean nuclear test include a new and specific ban on trade or transport of ballistic missiles and missile parts to or from North Korea.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, entitled ''Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations,'' found that Russia's arms agreements with the developing world totaled $7 billion in 2005, an increase from its $5.4 billion in sales in 2004. That figure surpassed the United States' annual sales agreements to the developing world for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France ranked second in arms transfer agreements to developing nations, with $6.3 billion, and the United States was third, with $6.2 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leading buyer in the developing world in 2005 was India, with $5.4 billion in weapons purchases, followed by Saudi Arabia with $3.4 billion and China with $2.8 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total value of all arms sales deals worldwide, when counting both developing and developed nations, in 2005 was $44.2 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian sales in 2005 included 29 of the SA-15 Gauntlet surface-to-air missile systems for Iran; Russia also signed deals to upgrade Iran's Su-24 bombers and MIG-29 fighter aircraft, as well as its T-72 battle tanks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a period of time, in the mid-1990s, the Russian government agreed not to make new advanced weapons sales to the Iran government,'' wrote Richard F.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A police sergeant who was shot twice as he tried to stop an execution-style shooting in Brooklyn on Thursday night was released from the hospital yesterday, and investigators had yet to find the gun used in the attack, the authorities said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sergeant, James A. Rector, 34, was initially listed in stable condition after being shot in the ankle and the buttocks after yelling at a teenage gunman, who then turned on him, according to the police.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gunman, Eric Hines, 17, had just shot another man who was on his knees, begging for his life near the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene, the authorities said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sergeant Rector was released from Bellevue Hospital Center about 1:30 p.m., the police said. Mr. Hines died after Sergeant Rector fired 11 rounds at him, striking him twice in his right side, once in his left and grazing his left leg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The man who had been begging for his life, whose name has not been released, remained in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the leg yesterday at Lutheran Medical Center, the police said. According to the authorities, that man's description of the events on Thursday matched Sergeant Rector's account.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After returning to his home in Queens, Sergeant Rector refused to talk to reporters waiting outside.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said they were still looking for the .40-caliber semiautomatic weapon they said Mr. Hines had used. After the shooting, the authorities said, someone grabbed the gun and ran into a nearby building at 14 Auburn Place. A bag of crack cocaine and a gun magazine were later thrown from an apartment window in the building, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After searching that apartment, the police said they recovered live rounds of ammunition for a .40-caliber weapon and a weight scale with cocaine residue, but not the gun. Four men and one woman were arrested and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS, Oct. 23 -- An American military officer based in Germany says that he has located with some certainty the spot on which the World War I hero Sgt. Alvin C. York carried out his famous exploit in the Argonne forest of northeastern France.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 8, 1918, Sergeant York, then a corporal, crept behind enemy lines with 16 other soldiers to attack German machine gunners who were holding up an American advance. They came under fire, and Sergeant York was credited with overcoming the superior force by using sharpshooting skills he had honed during turkey shoots and squirrel hunts in the Tennessee woods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competing camps of scholars and military historians have long debated the exact site of this legendary stand, which ended with the capture of 132 German soldiers and was immortalized in a 1941 film starring Gary Cooper. Until now, no one had found what seemed to be such striking material proof that the exploit might have taken place as described.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We nailed it,'' said Lt. Col. Douglas Mastriano, an American military intelligence officer working for NATO, who has spent six years researching the Sergeant York story using American and German military archives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general area where the fight took place, near the village of Chatel-Chehery, is well known, but vague and conflicting battlefield accounts made it impossible to say exactly where it occurred.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people involved in the hunt have agreed, however, that Sergeant York was the only one who emptied a sidearm in the narrow valley that day, and students of the issue have said that finding a concentration of empty Colt .45 cartridges would be the best proof of where he stood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Colonel Mastriano, his wife, Rebecca, his son Josiah and his friends Kory O'Keefe, Lt. Col. Jeff Parmer and Gary Martin spent nearly 1,000 hours walking the battlefield with metal detectors. On Oct. 14, Colonel Mastriano and Mr. O'Keefe found two .45 caliber rounds, one live and one that had been fired.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They returned the next weekend and found more evidence: 19 empty .45 cartridges scattered over a 10-foot-wide area at the base of a hill, along with German and American rifle rounds. Many of the German rounds had not been fired. They found more .45 slugs 20 yards away near the remains of a German trench together with hundreds of German rifle and machine gun cartridges, many of them live rounds, and bits of gun belts and debris consistent with soldiers surrendering.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The material fits closely with Sergeant York's account, in which he described firing his rifle toward machine gunners on a hill before pulling out his Colt .45 to pick off seven German soldiers who charged him with fixed bayonets. Colonel Mastriano had the casings examined by a ballistics expert, who confirmed that they all had come from the same gun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I honestly never thought that we would recover the .45s and was stunned when we dug them up,'' Colonel Mastriano said this week from his home in Heidelberg, Germany. ''The find means that the search for the York spot is over.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING, Oct. 26 -- Airbus won a huge order Thursday to supply 150 of its A320 short-haul jets to Chinese airlines serving a domestic travel boom and announced that it would open an assembly line in China.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, signed while President Jacques Chirac of France was visiting the Chinese capital with French businessmen, was a spot of bright news for Airbus. Delays in the A380 superjumbo jet and efforts to overhaul the design of the A350, the aircraft Airbus unveiled hastily last year to compete with the Boeing Dreamliner, are wrenching the company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese aviation authorities also signed a letter of intent to buy 20 of the company's A350 planes in what Airbus said was the biggest single deal it had won in China.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus, a unit of EADS, did not disclose the value of the agreement, but aviation experts said the A320 order alone would be worth about $10 billion at catalog prices if all the aircraft were delivered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus's decision to build its first final-assembly line outside Europe would assist the embattled European aircraft maker in its bid to match Boeing in the booming Chinese aviation market, analysts said. Airbus would be the only foreign aircraft maker, other than Embraer of Brazil, with an assembly plant in the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus's chief executive, Louis Gallois, said the plant, to be built in the northeastern city of Tianjin, would produce its first A320 in 2009 and have the capacity to assemble as many as four each year. Mr. Gallois said at a news conference in Beijing that this would fall short of the production needed to fill China's order, so the balance would come from other Airbus plants.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus is forecasting that it will need to sell 420 of the A380s, a 555-seat double-decker, to recover its development costs. That is 150 more than Airbus had calculated it would need to break even. The company now has 159 firm orders for the A380.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus, however, has continued to rack up strong sales of its smaller aircraft, including the A320, which can carry up to 180 passengers. China's order for 150 A320s comes on top of a deal that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao signed in Paris in December for 150 of the same model.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS, Oct. 26 -- Virgin Atlantic Airways said late Thursday that it had decided to postpone its order for six Airbus A380 jets by four years, making it the first airline to step back from its commitment to the troubled twin-deck plane and signaling the potential for more trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British airline, owned by the billionaire Richard Branson, and Airbus agreed in principle to defer delivery of the first A380s from 2009 to mid-2013, said Paul Charles, a Virgin spokesman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This means that they can take those production slots and give priority'' to customers like Singapore Airlines that are scheduled to take the first planes, Mr. Charles said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Atlantic is 49 percent owned by Singapore Airlines, which is due to receive the first A380 from Airbus in October 2007, two years later than promised.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 555-seat plane has been plagued by major production problems linked to the installation of electrical wiring. Airbus has said that the delays could wipe $6 billion off the profit of its parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, over four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said Virgin Atlantic's decision to defer its order was a setback for Airbus, though less so than an outright cancellation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Virgin isn't a huge customer, but it is valuable to Airbus to be associated with Richard Branson and to have A380s on North Atlantic routes,'' Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris, told Bloomberg News.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug McVitie, a consultant at Arran Aerospace in Dinan, France, agreed, but warned that Virgin Atlantic's decision could be a sign of more A380 deferrals or cancellations. ''There might well be a domino effect,'' Mr. McVitie said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, none of the 15 other airlines that have ordered the A380 have said definitively whether they plan to revise their orders, though several major customers, including Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas, have said they are considering ''all options'' in their talks with Airbus.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Atlantic has reached an agreement with Airbus on compensation for the delays, a source with knowledge of the talks said. Neither Virgin nor Airbus would comment on the terms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus has pushed back the A380 delivery schedule three times in 16 months, frustrating the expansion plans of carriers that had expected to put the plane in service by the end of this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Atlantic's current fleet is made up of Boeing 747s and Airbus A340s. The carrier said Thursday that it would extend existing leases for several 747-400 jets ''in order to meet our fleet needs and future growth plans.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Thursday, Bloomberg News reported that Skybus Airlines, a new closely held carrier based in Columbus, Ohio, agreed to buy 65 Airbus A319s for delivery beginning in 2008. Skybus plans to start service next year with four leased A319s.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its standard configuration, the A319 seats 124 passengers.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO, Oct. 25 -- The Boeing Company said Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings fell 31 percent and that its 787 jet program would be more expensive than expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly profit was hurt by a charge for discontinuing the in-flight Internet service Connexion. That offset higher jet sales and a 19 percent increase in total revenue, reflecting a thriving commercial plane business that led Boeing to raise its outlook for 2007 earnings and revenue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors focused on the company's comment that its 787 jet program was receiving increasing pressure over weight and supplier-related issues. It will also have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more than anticipated this year and next on research and development for the plane, which is scheduled to be delivered in 2008.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Weight remains a dogged issue,'' the chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said on a conference call.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net earnings for the period were $694 million, or 89 cents a share, down from $1.01 billion, or $1.26 a share, a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results included a charge of $280 million, or 22 cents a share, to exit the Connexion business. Earnings suffered in comparison with a year earlier, when the company had 93 cents a share in gains from tax benefits and asset sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue rose to $14.7 billion from $12.4 billion, bolstered by a 45 percent increase in commercial airplane sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing increased its estimate for 2007 earnings 20 cents a share to $4.45 to $4.65, citing the discontinuation of its Connexion investment, contributions from its recent $1.7 billion acquisition of the aircraft spare parts distributor Aviall and additional performance improvements.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Oct. 25 about two NASA satellites that are to observe the Sun in three dimensions, helping scientists monitor large solar eruptions, misstated the affiliation of a mission scientist, Janet G. Luhmann. She is a research physicist at the University of California, Berkeley -- not the University of California, Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Nov 03 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Oct. 24 -- Two satellites are scheduled to lift off on Wednesday night on a $550 million mission to observe the Sun in three dimensions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrying 16 instruments each, the satellites are to help scientists predict the billion-ton eruptions of electrified gas and deadly particles known as coronal mass ejections that cause the Northern Lights and can disrupt power grids on Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, called Stereo, for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, is the first in which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will use the tug of the Moon's gravity to send spacecraft to their final orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To gather 3-D views of the Sun, the two satellites have to fly in separate orbits so they can perceive depth, like a pair of human eyes. The orbits will closely track Earth's, but the two satellites will gradually separate, so that in four years they will be on opposite sides of the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project scientist for the mission, Michael Kaiser, said the coronal mass ejections were the most powerful solar phenomena.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They also cause electrical damage to spacecraft that are in orbit or even the ground power systems and, conceivably, even astronauts if they were exposed to one of these storms,'' Mr. Kaiser said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russ Howard, a scientist with the Naval Research Laboratory, said the eruptions were a concern to fliers on polar routes, where the number of solar particles is much higher than normal and Earth's protective magnetic field is weaker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kaiser said that at different times on the mission, each instrument would be at its most favorable position to study solar features.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another mission scientist, Janet G. Luhmann of the University of California, Los Angeles, said that even when the stereoscopic ability was limited the satellites would ''have a broadside view of the speed at which things are approaching the Earth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So it's really a very good space weather forecast,'' Ms. Luhmann said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission had originally been scheduled to fly last April, but was repeatedly delayed by instrument problems.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A veteran sergeant apparently fired his 9-millimeter pistol accidentally when he responded to a call about a fight at a party on the Upper East Side of Manhattan involving a gun on Sunday morning, police officials said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also said that the teenager who was wounded in the episode, Luke Timothy Saintel, 15, was hit in the back of his left leg by fragments of a spent bullet that ricocheted off the floor, not by a direct shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more precise chronology of what occurred in a dark and crowded ninth-floor apartment at 419 East 93rd Street was still being pieced together, the police said. As is usual in such cases, the Police Department's Firearms Discharge Review Board has begun an inquiry, the officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, an assistant district attorney is ''reviewing the circumstances of the incident,'' said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau's office.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a preliminary analysis of the shooting, including an account by the sergeant's supervisor, who was standing directly behind him during the encounter, found that the sergeant followed Mr. Saintel down a darkened hallway and drew his Glock service pistol -- keeping it at his side with the barrel facing downward -- only after he saw Mr. Saintel reach into his waistband as if about to draw a weapon, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sergeant was following Mr. Saintel and another person as they disappeared around a corner inside the apartment and went into a living room filled with about 50 young people who were gathered there for a party, the police said. Someone then bumped into the sergeant and his gun went off, discharging one bullet, the police said. It was unclear whether the officer was jostled intentionally or not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an apparent accidental shooting,'' said Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman. ''The round was discharged into the floor, and some of its fragments ricocheted into the individual's left leg.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sergeant was pulled from the room by his colleague and initially did not realize he had fired his gun, the police said. The officers regrouped and saw Mr. Saintel, of Staten Island, lying on the floor, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, in the hospital, Mr. Saintel told an investigator that he was in the hallway in the apartment when he saw the police officers coming and that he turned to get away from them and to try to mix in with the crowd, the police said. He said that he knew the sergeant had followed him, the police said, and that after he turned his back, he heard a shot and then realized he had been hit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Saintel said he was at the party smoking marijuana, the police said. Officers smelled marijuana in the apartment and saw that underage people were present and that alcohol was being served.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, Mr. Saintel was listed in good condition at NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell hospital, said John Rodgers, a hospital spokesman. Reached by phone in the hospital, a lawyer for the teenager and his family, Larry Bonchonsky, said he was interviewing his clients and getting a ''full explanation'' of what happened. He declined to comment on the official version of events.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 911 call reporting a fight involving a gun came at 1:12 a.m. from a woman who said that 60 people were spilling out of apartment 9-J at the East 93rd Street building. Six officers, in three police cars, responded from the 19th Precinct, the police said. After the shooting, officers found a Hungarian-made 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in a bedroom in the apartment, the police said, and its magazine was missing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said that Raymond Young, 18, and his sister, Juanita Young, 20, both who live in the apartment, were arrested after the shooting and face various charges, including criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of a controlled substance and obtaining alcohol for minors. Mr. Saintel was not facing charges, the authorities said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIRST OF THE VERY LIGHT JETS -- Eclipse Aviation said it expected to deliver the first so-called very light jet as early as this week to David Crowe, the co-owner of Magnum Aviation in California. Eclipse has more than 2,500 orders for its $1.52 million Eclipse 500 jets and expects to deliver 10 of them this year and 515 in 2007. The Federal Aviation Administration has predicted that 5,000 very light jets will be operating within 10 years. Besides Eclipse, which has booked the highest number of orders, other manufacturers making their own versions of the jets include Cessna, Adam Aircraft, Embraer and Honda. Some very light jets will be used to supplement corporate fleets for short-haul trips; others are being bought by companies that expect to operate them as on-demand air taxis, and some are being bought by individuals as entry-level private jets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SURGE IN BUSINESS JETS -- Annual deliveries of new business jets are expected to exceed 1,000 for the first time next year, Honeywell Aerospace says in its annual Business Aviation Outlook. That pace of deliveries is expected to continue for the rest of the decade, Honeywell said. The company said that more than 3,300 medium and medium-large jets will be delivered through 2011, as well as about 3,250 light and medium-light jets, 1,600 long-range and ultra-long-range jets and 1,300 large jets. Deliveries of new low-cost very light jets -- not included in the forecast figures -- ''are poised to accelerate rapidly'' next year, the company said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FARES CONTINUE UPWARD -- New data from the Air Transport Association shows that air fares have continued rising this year. The data showed a 10.8 percent increase in domestic yield -- the prices paid per mile, excluding taxes -- through September, compared with the period in 2005. Domestic load factors, or the percentage of total airline seats occupied by paying passengers, rose 1.5 percentage points, to 80.5 percent, for the first nine months of 2006, compared with the period in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTHWEST AND 787'S -- Northwest Airlines said it expected to take delivery of its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner in the third quarter of 2008, becoming the first North American airline to fly the new long-haul aircraft. Northwest has ordered 18 of the planes, with options and purchase rights for 50 more. The carrier, which has an extensive network of routes to Asia, said the new 787's would allow it to begin additional long-haul trans-Pacific routes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FREQUENT TRAIN MILES -- Amtrak has started a frequent-traveler loyalty program, called Guest Rewards for Business, aimed at small and midsize companies with five or more travelers who spend a total of at least $5,000 annually on travel in the Northeast Corridor.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERLIN, Oct. 22 -- The German government is weighing whether it could take a joint stake in EADS, the parent company of the aircraft maker Airbus, along with private investors and banks, the nation's finance minister said in comments released Sunday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, Peer Steinbruck, the finance minister, said German government participation in EADS could help stabilize the company and secure jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody has the idea of suddenly making the government an entrepreneur,'' Mr. Steinbruck said. ''But we can't let Airbus just fall headlong because some mismanagement has left it in a difficult position.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airbus, which is based in France, has suffered costly setbacks to its A380 superjumbo project. Earlier this month, it said that the project would be delayed two years and that the holdup would erase 4.8 billion euros ($6 billion) from EADS profit over four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Gallois became the fourth Airbus chief executive in 16 months when he took over from Christian Streiff on Oct. 9. Mr. Gallois has warned of painful job losses and pledged to stick to his predecessor's cost-cutting targets -- intended to generate 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in annual savings by 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany fears major job losses at the Airbus plant in Hamburg. Already last week, Airbus said it would cut 1,000 temporary staff and reduce working hours at its German operations. It also announced plans to cut working hours to as little as 28 hours a week for some staff in Germany -- though without cutting their pay.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Business Day on Sept. 28 about lobbying for the F-22 fighter jet referred imprecisely to the capabilities of the aircraft. While the F-22 and other fighters can reach 60,000 feet, only the F-22 can perform tactical maneuvers at that level, which is almost twice the altitude at which other jets can perform similar tactics.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADRID, Oct. 18 -- Spain's foreign minister said Wednesday that a deal to sell military aircraft to Venezuela had been canceled because American government objections made it unfeasible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration denied Spain's request in January, saying that the sale would strengthen the government of President Hugo Chavez, which is hostile to American interests, and destabilize the region. Permission from the White House was needed because the aircraft would use American technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EADS-CASA, the company that sought to build the airplanes, had said after the Bush administration's rejection that it would seek alternative technology from another country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Miguel Angel Moratinos, the foreign minister, announced that the company, a division of the European defense company EADS, had decided to drop those plans. ''The company tried to find alternatives for that transfer of technology, and it reached the conclusion that the economic effort required to carry it out would not be profitable,'' he said during a news conference in Madrid. The company did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aircraft deal, which involved the sale of 12 military transport planes, was signed in November as part of a broader agreement between Spain and Venezuela that was valued at 1.7 billion euros, about $2.1 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish officials say that the aircraft deal would have created hundreds of jobs. They also dispute the American contention that the sale would have a destabilizing effect, contending that transport planes are not suited for attack missions that could threaten Venezuela's neighbors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his comments, Mr. Moratinos suggested that the government would continue backing Spanish companies that seek deals with Venezuela in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We favor any business initiative with anyone in Latin America or any country that we feel fulfills the norms of trade, good behavior and good conduct,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spanish announcement comes as Venezuela is struggling to win international support for its bid to gain Latin America's open seat on the United Nations Security Council next year. Spain has endorsed Guatemala for the position.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to obtain comment from the Venezuelan Embassy in Madrid were unsuccessful. But during a brief visit to Madrid on Tuesday, Jose Vicente Rangel, the Venezuelan vice president, attributed the demise of the deal to ''limitations on Spanish sovereignty,'' an apparent allusion to American opposition to the sale, the Spanish news agency Europa Press reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American decision in January to reject Spain's request for permission to make the sale threatened to sour relations between the two countries just as they were recovering from the tension that originated with Spain's decision to withdraw from Iraq in April 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American officials have expressed unease over Madrid's refusal to adopt a hard-line approach to Venezuela, but stressed that the American position on the deal stemmed from its concerns over Mr. Chavez, a leftist populist, not Spanish policy.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Brooklyn-Born Rapper Is Arrested After Being Shot  </span>
</div><div class="author">By EMILY VASQUEZ; Reporting was contributed by Cara Buckley, Ann Farmer, Kate Hammer and Colin Moynihan.  </div><div>586 words</div><div>18 October 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brooklyn-born rapper known as Fabolous was shot early yesterday in a Manhattan parking lot and later arrested along with three members of his entourage when officers found two loaded guns in the car that the men fled in, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapper, whose legal name is John Jackson, was shot once in the right thigh sometime after midnight, after leaving Justin's, a soul-food restaurant at 31 West 21st Street near Fifth Avenue owned by the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson, 28, and his companions apparently rode off in a white 2005 Dodge Magnum, the police said. Officers responding to 911 calls of gunshots fired saw the Magnum run a red light and pulled it over. Inside the car were two semiautomatic pistols, one with its serial number filed off, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson, who was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, was later released and taken to the 13th Precinct station house, where his three companions were already being questioned, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four men denied any connection to the guns in the car, the police said. After being questioned, each was charged yesterday afternoon with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a defaced weapon. The police identified the three other men as Kevin Bass, 18; Percell German, 23; and Rascharm Davis, 29, all of Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson's lawyer, Alberto Ebanks, said later yesterday that the Dodge Magnum in which the guns were found was not the car his client was riding in when he arrived at the restaurant, where the group watched a football game. He said that Mr. Jackson instead arrived in a Cadillac Escalade, but that he had jumped into the Magnum after he was shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If any car had pulled up and offered him a ride to a local emergency room, he would have jumped in,'' Mr. Ebanks said. ''He was in the back seat bleeding profusely.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ebanks said the Magnum is registered to Ghetto Fabolous Inc., Mr. Jackson's production company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mr. Fabolous is simply the victim of a crime,'' Mr. Ebanks said, adding that Mr. Jackson did not have a ''beef'' with anyone and that it was unclear yesterday whether he was the target of the shooting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin's, named after Mr. Combs's son, draws professionals, athletes and other celebrities for Monday night football games projected on television screens, said a spokesman for the restaurant, Andre Suite.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson, who collaborated with Mr. Combs on a remix of the song ''Trade It All, Part II'' released in 2002, frequented the restaurant, the spokesman said. Mr. Combs, who was not at his restaurant Monday evening, was at a party at Crobar held for the release of his album ''Press Play.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suite said that there had been no argument inside Justin's. According to Mr. Jackson and his companions, a gunman approached the men as they left and began shooting in the parking lot outside, the police said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson, raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, became famous in late 2001 with his debut single, ''I Can't Deny It.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">For the Super-Rich, It's Time to Upgrade the Old Jumbo Jet  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOE SHARKEY  </div><div>1273 words</div><div>17 October 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tremendously rich are different not only from you and me but also from the merely rich. For one thing, some of them have really nice airplanes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not about the presumed titans of the private jet universe like the mighty Gulfstream G5's or Global Expresses, whose occupants can leap continents and oceans at high speed and in plush comfort, without all the inconveniences of commercial airports, airline schedules and, well, strangers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is about big, long-haul airliners that are converted to private jets and can carry not only pampered passengers and their entourages, but also, in some cases, their Rolls Royces and racehorses. These are specially equipped, privately owned jumbo jets -- the kind that normally carry as many 300 to 400 passengers -- but reconfigured with interiors designed for the enjoyment of, at most, a couple of dozen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in a market in which many owners progressively upgrade -- starting out, for example, with a Boeing 737 and eventually moving up -- the next big thing is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which lists for about $150 million and up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a private jet, at least under a new ''V.I.P.'' design being introduced today by Lufthansa Technik at the National Business Aviation Association convention and trade show in Orlando, Fla., the 787 will have 35 seats -- most of which can also be used as single lie-flat seats, queen-size beds or double beds, said Jennifer Urbaniak, a Lufthansa spokeswoman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a commercial airliner, the 787 will seat 210 to 330 passengers, depending on the airline that flies it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are around 39 Boeing 747's with interiors configured for V.I.P. use in the world, and many 757's and 767's, an MD-11, and two 777's,'' said Aaga Duenhaupt, a manager for Lufthansa Technik, based in Hamburg, a subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa that designs and builds the interiors for new and used (or ''pre-owned,'' as they like to say in both the luxury car and luxury jet markets) airliners for individual or corporate use.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the first deliveries of the 787 are not expected until 2008, industry experts say that marketing interior design plans now makes sense because there is always great interest in the next big thing at the highest end of the luxury private jet market. Ordering now ensures getting into the front of the line for a private 787, fully loaded, they say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PrivatAir, a Swiss company that markets charter and individual flights on privately configured big planes, is interested in buying a 787 from Boeing and in having it outfitted in true luxury, its chief executive, Greg Thomas, said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've signed a letter of intent and are still in negotiations about the finer points of the contract,'' he said. ''We have put money down; at the moment it's refundable. We are very interested in the airplane -- the capabilities are superb and it's a classy product.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PrivatAir, which specializes in long-haul V.I.P. flights, manages a fleet of 50 aircraft, including a 757 that is chartered by governments worldwide for special purposes. The 757 is also used three or four times a year for so-called air-cruises -- ''around-the-world trips for 21 days, basically by retired Americans,'' he said. Those trips can cost $50,000 to $70,000 a person.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such planes are also used for special business purposes. ''We've done movie launches,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''We did the launches of 'Ocean's 11' and 'Ocean's 12' and 'King Kong,' '' he said. ''The studio will rent the plane for the actors to go and do premieres. One of the 'Matrix' movies we whistle-stopped in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to open the movie in several cities one day after another.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas said PrivatAir had ordered a 767 aircraft and expected delivery late this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo jets are often favored by Arab sheiks and other fabulously wealthy people who tend not to advertise their opulent lifestyles. A notch or two down-market, the 777's, 767's and 757's are often coveted by corporate titans, among them Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, who bought a used 767 last year and spent millions converting it into a private jet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airliner-size jets are also used by individual business people. Among them is Willie Gary, who grew up in a family of migrant workers in Florida but is now a prominent liability lawyer. Weary of wasting valuable time away from his family in commercial airports and eager to have the space to conduct business in the air, Mr. Gary bought a Boeing 737 several years ago and had it outfitted as a private jet. He also owns a 16-seat Gulfstream G2 that he refers to as his ''second plane.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gary planned to invest in a bigger private 757, but now he says he is ready to kick the tires of the 787 Dreamliner, once the plane is on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the 737, we can take depositions,'' Mr. Gary said. ''We have meetings and settlement conferences. It gives me the luxury of getting in and getting out and moving on. I've touched down in as many as five states in a day,'' he said. ''But I'm not going to keep the 737 forever. I'm a goal setter, and I'm always looking for something new.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anticipating strong growth in private demand for the long-haul, airliner-size planes, Lufthansa Technik says it is setting up a unit to design 787 interiors for clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interiors have been developed in a partnership with Andrew Winch, who is best known for designing top-luxury interiors for big yachts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Lufthansa Technik has designed the interiors for 12 jumbo 747's, said Mr. Duenhaupt. A 747 purchased ''green,'' that is, with basically a bare interior, costs about $180 million, he said. ''And then, if you really want that 747 to be a full-blown V.I.P. aircraft, with all the V.I.P. luxuries, you can spend up to $50 million more on the interior.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some private 747's are even equipped with medical emergency rooms, ''including ones that can do open-heart surgery when people are flying into a certain environment,'' Mr. Duenhaupt said. ''But preferably the surgery is done on the ground when the plane has landed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luthnansa Technik is now working on preliminary designs for the much-delayed Airbus A380, which will be the biggest plane in the sky once it is available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its size, which will allow for even more luxury, the A380 has a feature that may appeal to the most status-conscious of owners, who may travel with underlings. That feature harks back to the days of ocean liners, where social classes were physically segregated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The A380 will offer a chance to separate the senior V.I.P.'s from the junior V.I.P.'s because you have two decks, and they can be kept apart,'' Mr. Duenhaupt said.  </p>
