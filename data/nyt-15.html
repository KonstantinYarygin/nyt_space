<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON -- Gazing upward I can see the skylines of Cambridge and Boston on the horizon as twilight falls. In the growing hush of full darkness, more than 9,000 stars appear, with so many gradations of intensity that binoculars can reveal more detail than the naked eye. And as I lean back in cushioned comfort, I am gradually swept off into the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the sensation offered by the newly renovated Charles Hayden Planetarium, which opened on Sunday at the Museum of Science here, after a $9 million yearlong reconstruction, its new equipment, software and 57-foot dome promising to take the next generation to the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to lose one's balance in the vastness of space, and over the last 15 years as planetariums around the country have revamped their systems and shows to take advantage of the latest in digital technology and the most refined fiber-optic projectors from Zeiss (the same company that outfitted the first modern planetarium in Germany in 1923), many times the moorings have come loose. The domes have been used to stage fantastical free-for-all shows of cinematic effects, including dinosaurs, cartoonish tubes of warped space and sub-woofer grumblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Boston's planetarium, whose director is David Rabkin, is remarkable, particularly in its first show, ''Undiscovered Worlds: The Search Beyond Our Sun,'' for never forgetting that we begin to make sense of the ethereal by keeping our feet on the ground. The pre-show presentation really does begin, as those at the old Hayden Planetarium in New York once did, with the local skyline lining the dome at twilight. Charles Hayden (1870-1937), a financier and philanthropist, made the New York planetarium possible with a donation; the foundation established by his will donated the money for Boston's version, which opened in 1958.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Hayden in Boston is now billed as ''the most technologically advanced digital theater in New England,'' it does not pursue thrills for their own sake, or with some exaggerated notion of what is required to lure media-sodden children into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show, instead, begins with a firm sense of place. And as it surveys the discovery of planets beyond our solar system, the old human-centered cosmos is never completely left behind: it actually motivates and guides the odyssey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, that motivation is even the subject of ''Undiscovered Worlds,'' which was written by Alan Lightman, who teaches humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with the planetarium staff. The search for other planetary systems in the cosmos is, after all, a quest for heavenly bodies that resemble our own. So in 1995, when the first planet outside our solar system is found orbiting the star 51 Pegasi, it is described as a ''monumental discovery,'' even though it is hardly a candidate for extraterrestrial life. It revolves so rapidly around its sun that its year lasts four Earth days, and its surface temperature is 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With advances in instrumentation and measurement, hundreds of other planets have been discovered since. ''We always assumed that other solar systems would resemble our own,'' we are told, as these newly found heavenly bodies, their details imagined in full color, fill the skies above our heads. We assumed ''that planets would orbit a star in tidy circles, with inner planets smaller and made of rock and outer ones larger and made of gas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were wrong,'' we learn. Almost all planets found so far have been at least as large as our Jupiter, but much closer to their suns than Mercury is to ours -- phenomena unaccounted for by contemporary theories of the solar system. And it wasn't until 2009 that a planet was discovered that, like Earth, is mostly made of rock. (Just this month The New York Times reported the possible discovery of over 1,200 smaller planets.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But held out to us is the tantalizing possibility of finding a planet that might be Earth-like enough so we can begin to imagine creatures bearing some resemblance to ourselves. We are even shown the hypothetical surface of such a planet, with lapping waves and lush plant life (their leaves black to absorb the full range of light offered in this galaxy far, far away). The entire journey, though, has been grounded in scientific principle rather than fantasy; it is careful while still being exotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium here doesn't have the advantage of a separate building (as in New York or Chicago) or an exquisite setting (as in Los Angeles), so the temptation must have been great to do something more: to create extravagant spectacles, perhaps, at least as flamboyant as the Imax theater across the museum's corridor. So the Hayden's more poised approach must have arisen out of philosophical or educational concerns, which are also reflected in the introductory exhibition leading into the planetarium, ''Cosmic Light.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It provides a basic understanding of the planets by connecting them with ordinary earthly experience. On Mars, for example, we learn, the year is 1.9 Earth years in length, that a 200-pound person would weigh just 75 pounds, and that if you drove to the Sun at 60 m.p.h., it would take 270 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More could have been done with this exhibition, but the planetarium's approach is clear: We begin to imagine the cosmos from where we stand. This is not as common an approach as it should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of a planetarium with a similar perspective is the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, which reopened after renovations in 2006. Its Art Deco building inspires a remarkable retro-sensibility in the planetarium show. A live presenter enters the dark theater holding an illuminated globe, speaking of the ''ancient mystery of the night sky'' with such appeal that later we are prepared to go outside in the evening air and look for ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something like that is possible here too. One Hayden show, ''The Sky Tonight,'' offers a human-led tour of the earthly heavens. And beginning in March the Gilliland Observatory, erected on the top level of the museum's parking lot, will have its seasonal opening; visitors will be able to use its 11-inch telescope to view some of the same phenomena shown on the planetarium's dome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a technological aspect to the Hayden's interaction between earthly perspective and cosmic speculation, as I learned from speaking with Darryl Davis, the systems coordinator for the planetarium. The Zeiss projector, which sets the standard for star configurations on domed ceilings, can only replicate the heavens as seen from Earth. In its earlier incarnations, it looked like a giant barbell; here the Zeiss Starmaster (as it is called) is egg shaped and compact, but its star displays are still geocentric. It can show the sky from different earthly locations and from different eras, but it is still our sky and only our sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way the Zeiss is pre-Copernican; it makes the Earth the center of the cosmos. Its advantage though is that it is extraordinarily precise, and can give a sense of the night sky unmatched by any other kind of projection, so subtly detailed that binoculars really can be used to discern what the eye cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But step off Earth's surface, as almost all planetarium shows now do, and the Zeiss images on the dome must give way to those of another projection system (here using Sky-Skan's DigitalSky 2 software). It draws on enormous databases of information about planets, stars and galaxies. Mr. Davis moves a cursor on a computer-screen grid and clicks on ''Go to Jupiter.'' Above, the domed sky whirls about, and we catapult through space until the planet with its famous surface storms appears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He clicks on other controls and the planet spins. We approach Jupiter's surface, map out the orbits of its moons and project their names. The stars here are not the pin pricks of precise illumination produced by the Zeiss, but are more hazy, calculated points, showing the heavens from another part of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis, comfortable navigating around the known universe, hands me the controls. I've never commanded this model starship, though, and I zoom in so fast on Saturn that I crash through it, until I learn to slide the cursor along the correct axis. I glide past the rings and go into gentle orbit, as another control speeds up the passing of time. And all the while, my feet are firmly on the ground -- a good way to begin to see the stars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Valentine's Day date with a comet went flawlessly. The day after was somewhat more problematic, although scientists were still ecstatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stardust spacecraft, traveling 24,000 miles per hour, passed 110 miles from the comet Tempel 1 at 11:40 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. This was the first time a comet had been seen close up twice. A different NASA spacecraft, Deep Impact, visited in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you ask me, was this mission a hundred percent successful in terms of the science, I would have to say no,'' said Joseph Veverka, a professor of astronomy at Cornell and principal investigator for the mission, at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added brightly, ''It was a thousand percent successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit to Tempel 1, an extension of Stardust's original mission, cost $29 million, a fraction of the $300 million to $500 million that would be needed to send a new spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists wanted to see how parts of Tempel 1's surface seen by Deep Impact have changed, they wanted to see new swaths that Deep Impact did not take pictures of, and they wanted to see the impact crater created by an 820-pound copper slug unleashed by Deep Impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ensure that the desired parts of Tempel 1 would be facing Stardust as it passed, scientists had to precisely track the comet's rotation, and NASA had to precisely navigate the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Veverka said the orientation of Tempel 1 turned out to be within a couple of degrees of the predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the scientists had to wait to see the results. The spacecraft had been commanded to first send back five photographs taken at closest approach, but because of a software glitch, it instead sent back the images in the order they had been taken, starting with faraway ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the close-up images arrived, they covered everything on the checklist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter H. Schultz, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University and a co-investigator, said the Deep Impact crater, about 500 feet across, was ''more subdued'' than had been expected. Material that was kicked up by the collision then fell back. ''The crater partly healed itself,'' Dr. Schultz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists actually had more trouble showing the images than the spacecraft had taking them; the picture of the impact crater was left out from the presentation slides shown at the news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let me just tell them,'' Dr. Schultz said. ''We saw the crater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Veverka interjected, ''Yeah, we really did see the crater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the news conference, NASA was able to display a comparison between what Deep Impact saw five-and-a-half years ago and what Stardust saw Monday. The images can also be seen at nasa.gov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald E. Brownlee of the University of Washington, another co-investigator, described the rat-tat-tat of dust particles that hit the spacecraft. ''Like a B-17 in World War II flying through flak,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An instrument on Stardust was able to do chemical analysis on the dust particles, finding carbon and carbon-nitrogen fragments, Dr. Brownlee said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEMPE, Ariz. -- We're not in the Garden of Eden anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darwin speculated that life began in a warm pond on the primordial Earth. Lately other scientists have suggested that the magic joining of molecules that could go on replicating might have happened in an undersea hot spring, on another planet or inside an asteroid. Some astronomers wonder if it could be happening right now underneath the ice of Europa or in the methane seas of Titan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two dozen chemists, geologists, biologists, planetary scientists and physicists gathered here recently to ponder where and what Eden might have been. Over a long weekend they plastered the screen in their conference room with intricate chemical diagrams through which electrons bounced in a series of interactions like marbles rattling up and down and over bridges through one of those child's toys, transferring energy, taking care of the business of nascent life. The names of elements and molecules tripped off chemists' tongues as if they were the eccentric relatives who show up at Thanksgiving every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They charted the fall of meteorites and the rise of oxygen on the early Earth and evidence in old rocks that life was here as long as 3.5 billion years ago. The planet is only a billion years older, but estimates vary on when it became habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In front of a 2,400-member audience one night they debated the definition of life -- ''anything highly statistically improbable, but in a particular direction,'' in the words of Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist at Oxford. Or, they wondered if it could be defined at all in the absence of a second example to the Earth's biosphere -- a web of interdependence all based on DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence the quest for extraterrestrial examples is more than a sentimental use of NASA's dollars. ''Let's go look for it,'' said Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., who is involved with the Mars Science Laboratory, which will be launched in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid appearance of complex life in some accounts -- ''like Athena springing from the head of Zeus,'' in the words of Dr. McKay -- has rekindled interest recently in a theory fancied by Francis Crick, one of the discoverers of the double helix, that life originated elsewhere and floated here through space. These days the favorite candidate for such an extraterrestrial cradle is Mars, which was once a water world. Perhaps, some think, its microbes hitched a ride to Earth on asteroids -- unless, of course, the microbes went the other way and what's to be found on Mars are the dead remains of long-lost cousins of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've crashed more space probes on Mars than anywhere else -- it's that interesting,'' Dr. McKay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference was sponsored by the Origins Project at Arizona State University in an effort to get people together who don't normally talk to each other, said Lawrence Krauss, a physicist who helped organize the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk is indeed hard across disciplines and geological ages. John Sutherland, a biochemist at Cambridge University in England, said geologists and astronomers were more interested in talking and speculating about the origin of life than chemists were, even though it is basically a problem of ''nitty-gritty chemistry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason, he explained, is that ''chemists know how hard it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern version of the Garden of Eden goes by the name of RNA world, after the molecule ribonucleic acid, which plays Robin to DNA's Batman today, but is now thought have preceded it on the biological scene. RNA is more versatile, being able not only to store information, like DNA, but also to use that information to catalyze reactions, a job now performed by proteins. That solved a sort of chicken-and-egg problem about which ability came first into the world. The answer is that RNA could be both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to think of it that way, life is a very simple process,'' said Sidney Altman, who shared a Nobel Prize in 1989 for showing that RNA had these dual abilities. ''It uses energy, it sustains itself and it replicates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lesson of the meeting was how finicky are the chemical reactions needed for carrying out these simple-sounding functions. ''There might be a reason why amino acids and nucleotides are the way they are,'' Dr. Krauss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What looks complicated to us might not look so complicated to a piece of a carbon molecule awaiting integration into life's dance. ''Complexity is in the eye of the beholder,'' said Dr. Sutherland, who after 10 years of trying different recipes succeeded in synthesizing one of the four nucleotides that make up RNA in a jar in his lab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the right mixture and conditions, complicated-looking molecules can assemble themselves without help. ''When everything is in the pot,'' he said, ''the chemistry to make RNA is easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sutherland's results were hailed as a triumph for the RNA world idea, but there is much work to be done, said Steve Benner, who constructs artificial DNA at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, in Florida. Nobody knows whether Dr. Sutherland's recipe would work on the early Earth, he said. Moreover, even if RNA did appear naturally, the odds that it would happen in the right sequence to drive Darwinian evolution seem small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Other than that,'' Dr. Benner said, ''the RNA world is a great idea for origin of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some others, including astronomers and geologists, have another view of biological inevitability. Life is a natural consequence of geology, said Everett Shock, a geophysicist at Arizona State. ''Most of what life is doing is using chemical energy,'' Dr. Shock said, and that energy is available in places like undersea volcanic vents where life, he calculated, acts as a catalyst to dissipate heat from the Earth. In what he called ''a sweet deal,'' life releases energy rather than consuming it, making it easy from a thermodynamic standpoint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Biosynthesis is profitable -- it has to be; they live there,'' said Dr. Shock, referring to microbes in undersea vents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists say we won't really understand life until we can make it ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the last day of the conference, J. Craig Venter, the genome decoding entrepreneur and president of the J. Craig Venter Institute, described his adventures trying to create an organism with a computer for a parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using mail-order snippets of DNA, Dr. Venter and his colleagues stitched together the million-letter genetic code of a bacterium of a goat parasite last year and inserted it into another bacterium's cell, where it took over, churning out blue-stained copies of itself. Dr. Venter advertised his genome as the wave of future migration to the stars. Send a kit of chemicals and a digitized genome across space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll create panspermia if it didn't already exist,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new genome included what Dr. Venter called a watermark. Along with the names of the researchers were three quotations, from the author James Joyce; Robert Oppenheimer, who directed the building of the atomic bomb; and the Caltech physicist Richard Feynman: ''What I cannot build, I do not understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the news came out, last year, Dr. Venter said, the James Joyce estate called up and threatened to sue, claiming that Joyce's copyright had been violated. To date there has been no lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Caltech called up and complained that Dr. Venter's genome was misquoting Feynman. The institute sent a photograph of an old blackboard on which Feynman had written, ''What I cannot create, I do not understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so his genome is now in the process of acquiring its first, non-Darwinian mutation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is set to launch an Earth-orbiting satellite on a $424 million mission to analyze grit spewed by volcanoes, forest fires, smokestacks and tailpipes. The Glory satellite is slated to blast off before dawn Wednesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Taurus XL rocket. Its main job will be to study fine airborne particles known as aerosols. Smaller than the diameter of a human hair, these specks can move great distances across the globe and are largely responsible for hazy skies. Also, NASA is set to launch the space shuttle Discovery on Thursday from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Its mission to the International Space Station was halted four months ago due to a hydrogen gas leak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M -- Somewhere off a dusty road in southern New Mexico sits a hulking horseshoe-crab-shaped structure and a two-mile-long slab of concrete flanked by mesas and mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to Spaceport America, the country's first facility built specifically for commercial space travel -- an endeavor that the state envisioned as the epicenter of a fledgling industry where tourists would pay large sums to take suborbital flights into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, though, after years of planning and debate, New Mexico's grand ambitions for Spaceport have come down to earth, its future entwined with the state's struggling economy. Though more than 400 people have put down flight deposits totaling more than $55 million, it is still not exactly clear when the first flight will launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her first two months in office, Gov. Susana Martinez removed the Spaceport's supervising board, pushed out its executive director and began a review of the project's finances, saying the Spaceport needed more robust private investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martinez, a Republican, was elected on a promise of paring government, and the state's revenue windfall is long gone. The governor has since made a point of stating her support for the project, and this month she appointed a new board, including three former members and Sid Gutierrez, a former astronaut. But she has also vowed to privatize the Spaceport, saying taxpayers have already paid their fair share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Spaceport is part of the plan for economic development in New Mexico, and the voters made it clear they support it,'' Ms. Martinez said in a recent interview. ''We want to be a leader in space exploration, but we want to do it within our budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dream of a commercial spaceport has been around for years in New Mexico, which has long had a love affair with aerospace and aliens. Back in 2006, flush with oil and gas revenue, the Legislature, pushed by Gov. Bill Richardson, approved $132 million to build the Spaceport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing to reap the benefits if the project succeeds, voters in Dona Ana and Sierra Counties passed a quarter-cent sales tax, which will provide the remaining money needed for construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New Mexico has since taken on a $450 million deficit. The ambitious project was budgeted at about $209 million, but a second runway could be needed to expand commercial operations. Ms. Martinez has made it clear she wants any additional financing for the Spaceport to come from private industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's going to be our big push right now,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the project say the Spaceport could create hundreds of jobs and draw wealthy tourists. But some here question the new governor's commitment to see it through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's face it -- privatizing the Spaceport means selling it off and trying to remove any risk to the state,'' said Rick Homans, who was appointed by Mr. Richardson as the facility's executive director until Ms. Martinez asked him to step down. ''The message would be that the state is not committed long term, and the new industry will look at other states where they can find a fully engaged partner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Mexico is not the only entity heavily invested. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has signed on to be the facility's anchor tenant for 20 years and has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars toward developing the technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, amid considerable fanfare, Virgin began taking reservations for spaceflights -- a ticket costs $200,000. Construction of the 110,000-square-foot hangar and terminal is nearing completion. Virgin Galactic's chief executive and president, George Whitesides, said in a recent interview that the company expected to launch commercial flights within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its engineers are working to finish the rocket engine that will power the small spaceship, Mr. Whitesides said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin estimates each flight will take roughly two and a half hours -- including four minutes in actual space and the iconic view of Earth from outside its atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitesides predicted that the spectacle of the rich and famous being rocketed into space will lure much needed work here, and Virgin is looking at building a luxury hotel nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, the state's economy has changed. That said, most of the money has either already been allocated or spent on the project,'' said Mr. Whitesides, a former chief of staff for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''I really do think this is a case where the investment has been made, and a relatively small expenditure will open the possibility for tremendous growth in New Mexico.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nearby Truth or Consequences, a quirky art town named for the long-running game show, residents have mixed, though curious, thoughts about space travel in their backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm for the Spaceport,'' said Cherrill Sullivan, who owns a western clothing shop here. ''We need jobs bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A local hair stylist, Susan Kopet, shook her head at the notion of the Spaceport's providing an economic boon for the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I pay taxes on it, but I don't have the money to go up in space,'' Ms. Kopet said. ''I can think of a lot better ways to spend millions of dollars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former Spaceport board member, D. Kent Evans, a supporter of Ms. Martinez, finds himself reassuring locals about the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just want it to be successful,'' Mr. Evans said. ''I tell people this is going to be one of the best decisions they ever made.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- With seconds to spare after a last-minute glitch, the repaired shuttle Discovery, grounded since November because of vexing fuel tank cracks, rocketed into orbit Thursday on its 39th and final flight, setting off for the International Space Station to deliver supplies, equipment and a final American storage module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countdown proceeded smoothly into its final hour, but trouble with an Air Force tracking system computer threw the outcome into doubt. With the countdown holding at the five-minute mark, the Air Force reported a successful repair. The countdown resumed, and Discovery blasted off at 4:53:24 p.m. Eastern time -- three seconds before the end of the day's launching window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery put on a spectacular show for area residents and tourists, who crowded nearby roads and beaches to witness the shuttle's final climb to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flight controllers were paying close attention to the view from a camera mounted on the side of the shuttle's external tank, on the lookout for any signs of foam insulation falling away that could pose a threat to the ship's fragile heat shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extensive foam work was done as part of repairs to fix cracks in the external tank that forced NASA to ground the shuttle after the scrubbing of a planned Nov. 5 launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the climb on Thursday, several large pieces of debris could be seen falling from the tank, some striking the shuttle's heat shield, but the shedding appeared to occur well after the shuttle was out of the dense lower atmosphere, where debris impacts can cause the most damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No obvious impact damage could be seen in the downlink television views, but a detailed analysis will be carried out over the next few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the shuttle is on track for a docking with the International Space Station around 2:15 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery's a great ship,'' Michael Leinbach, the launch director, told reporters Wednesday. ''This is her 39th mission; we'd have quite a few left in her had the program been extended.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On board Discovery are five men and one woman: strapped into seats on the upper flight deck are the commander, Steven W. Lindsey; Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force, the pilot; Capt. Benjamin Alvin Drew Jr. of the Air Force; and Nicole P. Stott, the flight engineer. On the ship's lower deck are Michael R. Barratt, a physician and astronaut, and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen of the Navy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Bowen is a late addition. A veteran of five spacewalks, he was called in to replace the mission's original lead spacewalker, Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army, who was injured in a bicycle mishap last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew change was a relatively minor snag compared with the testing and analysis required to resolve questions about potentially dangerous cracks that were found after the Nov. 5 launching was called off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming an on-time docking on Saturday, Captain Drew and Captain Bowen plan two spacewalks, Monday and Wednesday. The new storage module will be attached to the station on Tuesday. The flight plan calls for Discovery to undock from the station on March 5 and land at the Kennedy Space Center on March 7.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, within a couple of years, tourists will be rocketing into space aboard a Virgin Galactic space plane -- paying $200,000 for about four minutes of weightlessness -- before coming back down for a landing on a New Mexico runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in the next seat could be a scientist working on a research experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science, perhaps even more than tourism, could turn out to be big business for Virgin and other companies that are aiming to provide short rides above the 62-mile altitude that marks the official entry into outer space, eventually on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $200,000 ticket is prohibitively expensive except for a small slice of the wealthy, but compared with the millions of dollars that government agencies like NASA typically spend to get experiments into space, ''it's revolutionary,'' said S. Alan Stern, an associate vice president of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s space sciences and engineering division in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is a spirited evangelist for the science possibilities of what is known in aerospace circles as suborbital travel. Just as important as the lower cost, scientists will be able to get their experiments to space more quickly and more often, Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're really at the edge of something transformational,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern's institute announced Monday that it has signed a contract and paid the deposit to send two of its scientists up in Virgin's SpaceShipTwo vehicle. Southwest also intends to buy six more seats -- $1.6 million in tickets over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That follows an announcement on Thursday that Southwest is buying six seats from another suborbital company, <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> of Mojave, Calif., which has been charging $95,000 a seat for tourists. XCOR's Lynx space plane carries just two people -- the pilot and the paying passenger -- so each flight will carry an experiment and an institute scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have built, on our own dime, three payloads,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We're buying tickets, before there is a government program from suborbital providers, for our own people to fly with those experiments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the Southwest experiments will look at how loose soil and rocks like those that cover asteroids behave. Another will fly an ultraviolet telescope that flew on the space shuttle Discovery in 1997. The third is a biomedical harness to measure heartbeat, blood pressure and other physical parameters of the scientist during flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the experiments will get to space has not been set. Neither company has yet announced when commercial flights will begin, but eventually SpaceShipTwo could fly once or twice a day, and the Lynx is designed for up to four flights a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin has already performed unpowered glide tests for the six-passenger SpaceShipTwo at Spaceport America in New Mexico and will begin powered ones soon. XCOR may begin flight tests of the Lynx later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other companies -- Blue Origin, created by Jeff Bezos, founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, and Armadillo Aerospace -- are also developing spacecraft for the tourist business. Another company, Masten Space Systems Inc., is developing a suborbital vehicle that will carry only payloads, not people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if only some of these companies succeed, the prospect is that in a few years, hundreds of suborbital flights could be taking off every year. Dr. Stern predicted that even though a single flight would offer only a few minutes of weightlessness, the cumulative time of the suborbital experiments could quickly overtake that of the International Space Station, which has been in orbit for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will be flying automated scientific payloads on Masten and Armadillo rockets this year, and the agency will provide more opportunities for researchers in future years, although it has not offered to buy seats for people to accompany their experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists, that could finally provide them ready access to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's almost impossible to get research on the space station at the moment,'' said Mark Shelhamer, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University medical school who would like to study people's balance and other motor sensory abilities before and after suborbital flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, gravity is the dominant force, and many common processes -- the way that water boils, for instance, and that a flame burns -- behave much differently without it. But many of the theories describing how physics should work in weightlessness have not been tested in detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists currently have a few options for investigating weightlessness. They can drop the experiment from a tall tower, which provides a couple of seconds of zero gravity before it goes splat on the ground. They can send the experiment up in an airplane that flies an arcing trajectory known as a parabola, which provides up to half a minute of apparent weightlessness. Or they can get something to the International Space Station, where the pull of gravity is continuously absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suborbital flights will offer an opportunity that falls between the parabolic plane flights and the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new commercial vehicles are essentially rocket-powered projectiles that arc upward and then fall back down, never coming close to the 17,500-miles-per-hour velocity needed to achieve orbit. At the top of the arc, passengers float for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suborbital flights will also let atmospheric scientists explore in detail the Earth's middle atmosphere, extending from about 30 to 50 miles above the surface, which cannot be easily observed from Earth or satellites. Biologists also hope to study how people, who rely on gravity to tell which way is up, respond to the rapid gyrations of gravity during a suborbital flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting the interest in the science community, more than 300 people are registered to attend a conference this week at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, organized by Dr. Stern, to discuss suborbital research. Researchers, Dr. Stern said, ''vote with their feet. They go to these meetings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the conference, the suborbital companies will provide updates on their progress, and scientists will talk about what types of research will be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> is the first paying science customer for Virgin, which already has deposits from more than 400 would-be space tourists. George T. Whitesides, chief executive, said that science and technology development could turn into a big market. ''We think that many new applications and studies will flourish with such access -- access which does not exist today,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitesides said that the science experiments would generally fly separately from the tourists, although it might be possible for researchers with unobtrusive biology experiments to ride on a tourist flight. ''We would of course not mix the two categories on the same flight if we thought that one would negatively impact the other,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the experiments require the scientist as passenger. Blue Origin, for example, has selected three scientific payloads that will fly on unmanned test flights of its New Shepard vehicle. One of the Blue Origin scientists is Joshua Colwell, a professor of physics at the University of Central Florida, who wants to understand how dust grains in the early solar system stuck together through low-speed collisions and grew in size to five-mile-wide planetesimals, which then combined into planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Dr. Colwell applied to NASA to fly his experiment on the space shuttle, and it flew twice, in 1998 and 2001, but he has not been able to get follow-up research off the ground since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Colwell's experiments, which require only a few minutes of weightlessness, the suborbital flights would work just as well as a much more expensive shuttle flight. And he hopes to be able to fly them perhaps several times a year instead of once every several years. Blue Origin declined to say when the test flights might occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another of the Blue Origin researchers, Steven H. Collicott of Purdue University, is looking at how surface tension -- the force that causes raindrops to roll up into beads on leaves -- pulls liquids in space. Without gravity, these so-called capillary effects are the dominant forces on liquids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Collicott, who has collaborated on experiments on the space station, said the suborbital flights will be a complement to the station, not a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that first off, they really are two vastly different opportunities,'' he said. On the station, ''the ability of running an experiment hour after hour after hour is the ultimate. On these new suborbital rockets, we might get three minutes, but it's a lot cheaper. It's a lot quicker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his Blue Origin experiment, financed by the National Science Foundation, cost $20,000. He has also has a couple of smaller, shoebox-size experiments built by undergraduates for less than $1,000. Those are slated to fly on developmental flights by Masten and Armadillo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a nice, really great addition to the facilities available for research,'' Dr. Collicott said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">.The loss of the Glory satellite early this morning is another setback for efforts to fill substantial gaps in the understanding of some important aspects of the climate system. Just over two years ago, another important satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, was destroyed in a failed launch. Components that contributed to that failure (couplings for a clamshell-like shield over the satellite) had been redesigned and three successful launches took place last year, mission officials said at a news conference (video is below).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is creating a "mishap investigation" board to determine what went wrong this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gavin Schmidt of NASA has posted a reflection on this mission and the larger context on Realclimate:Glory (not to) be</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This morning one of the most important (and most delayed) satellite launches in ages took place. The mission was to launch the&nbsp;Glory satellite into a polar orbit, where three key instruments would have been looking at solar irradiance, aerosols and clouds. Unfortunately, one of the stages failed to separate and the satellite&nbsp;did not make orbit. [Click here for the background.]Here's Gavin's kicker: This is of course a huge setback for the mission team (many of whom I know), and I can only imagine how frustrating this must be. The&nbsp;loss of OCO two years ago was due to a similar problem, though 3 launches since then have been successful (and the same system is being replicated as&nbsp;OCO-2). With the&nbsp;postponement of CLARREO in the proposed 2012 budget, there is a huge hole building in the US contribution to Earth and Sun observing systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from space is hard, expensive and risky. We cannot take it for granted, and yet we need that information more than ever.Here's video of the news conference following the failed launching:.There's more context on Nature's news page and around the blogosphere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was a Soviet hero, a space pioneer (and a bit of a boozehound) who risked it all to save a doomed comrade. An excerpt from "Starman," a new biography on the rise and fall of Yuri Gagarin, featured in the pages of our upcoming Spring Men's issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April 12, 1961: 108 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before the launch, the chief Soviet spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev came on the link. ''Yuri Alexeyevich, how are you hearing me? I need to tell you something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Receiving you loud and clear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just want to remind you that after the one-minute readiness is announced, there'll be about six minutes before you actually take off, so don't worry about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I read you. I'm absolutely not worried.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There'll be six minutes for all sorts of things, you know.'' He meant that a minor instrument problem had created a six-minute delay in the launch sequence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the cosmonaut Pavel Popovich came on the line. ''Hey, can you guess who's this talking to you?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure, it's 'Lily of the Valley!'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yuri, are you getting bored in there?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there was some music, I could stand it a little better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerned for every last detail of the flight, Korolev took care of this personally, ordering his technicians to find some tapes or records and set something up straight away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Haven't they given you some music yet?'' he asked a few minutes later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing so far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Damned musicians. They dither about and the whole thing is sooner said than done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, now they've done it. They've put on a love song.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Good choice, I'd say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8:41 a.m. Gagarin felt the shudder of distant valves slamming shut, the rocket swaying as the fuel lines were pulled away. ''Yuri, we're going down to the control bunker now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8:51 a.m. The music stopped. Korolev's deep, stern voice on the link, all seriousness now.''Yuri, the 15-minute mark.'' This was the signal for Gagarin to seal his gloves and swing down the transparent visor on his helmet. In these last minutes before liftoff there was no NASA-style 5-4-3-2-1 ''countdown'' on the public-address system (and no public-address system). The rocket would be fired at the appointed instant: 9:06 a.m., Moscow time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Launch key to 'go' position.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Air purging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Idle run.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ignition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All kinds of vibrations now, high whinings and low rumbles. At some point Gagarin knew he must have lifted off, but the exact moment was elusive, identified with precision only by the electrical relays of the gantry's hold-down arms as they moved aside, the four clamps disconnecting from the rocket's flanks within a single hundredth of a second of each other. Gagarin lay rigid in his seat and tensed his muscles. At any moment something could go wrong with the booster, the hatch above his head might fly away, and his ejection charges would punch him out into the morning sky like a bullet. This ''life-saving'' jolt might kill him - crunch his spine; snap his neck like a chicken's; the hatchway's rim might snag his knees and tear them right off. He had to be prepared. The G-load climbing. No emergency ejection yet. ...He didn't remember it later, but they told him he shouted out, ''Poyekhali!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's go!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T-plus 70.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I read you, 70. I feel excellent. Continuing the flight. G-load increasing. All is well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T-plus 100. How do you feel?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel fine. How about you?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two minutes into the flight Gagarin was finding it a little hard to speak into his radio microphone. The G-forces were pulling at his face muscles. There was a strange moment when all the weight lifted and he was thrown violently forward against his straps. A shudder told him that the rocket's four side-slung boosters were falling away. It paused in its acceleration, as if taking a big breath before the final spurt. Then the central core picked up the pace and the sensation of great weight returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five minutes up. Another jolt as the exhausted central core was dropped. Millions of rubles' worth of complex machinery was tossed aside without a second thought, like a spent match flicked to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine minutes after he had left the pad, Gagarin was in orbit. The vibrations ceased, yet there was no particular sensation of silence. Only those who have never traveled into orbit are in the habit of describing ''the eerie silence of outer space.'' The ship was noisy with air fans, ventilators, pumps and valves for the life-support system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a porthole Gagarin saw a sudden shock of blue, a blue more intense than he had ever seen. The earth passed across one porthole and drifted upward out of sight, then reappeared in another porthole on the other side of the ball before drifting downward out of sight. The sky was intensely black now. Gagarin tried to see the stars, but the television lamp in the cabin was glaring directly into his eyes. Suddenly the sun appeared in one of the portholes, blindingly bright. Then the earth again - the horizon not straight but curving like a big ball's, with its layer of atmospheric haze so incredibly thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traveling eastward, ever eastward, flying at eight kilometers per second, the dials indicated: 28,000 kmph, although Gagarin would not have experienced any sense of speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How are you feeling?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The flight continues well. The machine is functioning normally. Reception excellent. Am carrying out observations of the earth. Visibility good. I can see the clouds. I can see everything. It's beautiful!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September 1961: A Bad Landing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crimea is almost an island. It juts out into the Black Sea, connected to Ukraine by two peninsulas as delicate as veins. The northernmost territories of the island are pleasant but dull. The south is a different matter. There are beautiful mountains, sun-dappled forests, sheltered beaches speckled with palms. The weather is still fine in October, and the almond trees are back in bloom by February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 1960s heyday, the Tesseli dacha at Foros was a luxury sanitarium complex designed to accommodate only the most privileged group bookings. Warm seas, fresh meat and fruit, fine wines, perhaps a certain freedom from everyday restraints: all of these pleasures were available, and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call her "Anna"; perhaps there were two Annas. Anna Rumanseyeva, a young nurse, was on duty at Tesseli on Sept. 14, 1961, when Gagarin and his cosmonaut comrades came to stay. She speaks with intimate knowledge of another nurse called Anna, also working at Foros when Gagarin came to stay. Maybe the two Annas are one and the same person? It is not important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are some people in life, especially men, who are constantly looking for adventure," she says. "I would say Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin was this kind of person."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yuri and his wife, Valentina, arrived at the sanitarium with their second daughter, Galya, 6 months old and still in need of her mother's constant attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin seemed desperate for distraction. In the second week, he took some of his companions out to sea in a small motorboat. The Foros staff pleaded with him: it was against the rules, he did not know the local conditions, the wind was offshore, the weather could be difficult, he should not go. But he went anyway, taking the boat far from shore and driving it recklessly, making tight turns to splash his passengers with spray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swell picked up, just as he had been warned. The boat was carried over the horizon and out of sight of the shore, and a larger motorboat had to be sent out to make a rescue. When they hauled him back ashore, Gagarin went to the medical station for assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rough conditions he had turned the boat's steering wheel so hard that his hands were bloodied and cracked. But the pain, and the unpleasantness of his foolish adventure, did not entirely divert his attention from the pretty blond-haired nurse who attended to his blisters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Rumanseyeva recalls a party held the next day, in which Gagarin, his wife and the other "Anna" were present: " 'Anna' said she went into a room and sat on a sofa. Yuri Alexeyevich - I don't know what was on his mind. He was drunk. Perhaps he wanted to talk? I don't think he had any other thoughts. Anyway, he went into the room. He closed the door but didn't lock it with a key. Valentina Ivanovna went into the room immediately after him."_</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You know, his wife Valentina was quite a complicated woman," says the Soviet space journalist Yaroslav Golovanov. "She protected Yuri from every kind of temptation which came as a result of his position. . . . Anyway, Valentina discovered that the First Cosmonaut had disappeared, and she decided to find out where he was, and he showed the true colors of goodness and of a gentleman. He showed genuine nobility and jumped out of a window on the second floor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both women leaned over the balcony's edge to take a look and saw Gagarin sprawled on the ground, motionless. "At that time, there were wild grapes growing on the balconies," Anna Rumanseyeva explains. "They may have caught him as he jumped. He hit a curbstone with his forehead. It was not a good landing. On his return from space he landed successfully. Here, unsuccessfully."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they took him inside, where the doctors applied local anesthetic to his brow. Some of the bone in his forehead was chipped. When the surgeons arrived, they cleared out the fragments, effected temporary repairs and stitched the wound. Gagarin held someone's hand throughout. He made no sound whatsoever, but his nails left livid marks, so tight was his grip. The enormity of Gagarin's blunder seemed to catch up with him. He looked up at the nurse Anna for a moment, and she remembers him asking her just one question. "Will I fly again?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April 1967: Falling to Earth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the spring of 1967, development of the Soyuz spacecraft, which was intended to eventually put a Soviet man on the moon, was moving toward that crucial first flight. On April 22, the Soviet propaganda departments felt confident enough to let slip some rumors to the international press agency UPI. "The upcoming mission will include the most spectacular Soviet space venture in history - an attempted in-flight hookup between two ships and a transfer of crews."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cosmonaut Alexei Leonov says, "The first manned test of the Soyuz was assigned to Vladimir Komarov, with Yuri Gagarin as the backup, and another Soyuz spacecraft was being prepared for Yuri to fly at a later date."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Komarov's launch was supposed to be followed a day later by another Soyuz with three more crewmen aboard. It seems likely that the Brezhnev administration wanted the docking to take place on or around May Day. The year 1967 had a special significance in the Communist calendar; it was the 50th anniversary of the 1917 revolution. The concept of making a "union" between two spaceships collaborating in orbit was highly symbolic, especially for a ruling government obsessed with symbols.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the deadline for the mission drew near, technicians knew of 203 separate faults in the spacecraft that still required attention. Yuri Gagarin was closely involved in this assessment. By March 9, 1967, he and his closest cosmonaut colleagues had produced a formal 10-page document, with the help of the engineers, in which all the problems were outlined in detail. The trouble was, no one knew what to do with it. Within Soviet society, bad news always reflected badly on the messenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many as 50 senior engineers knew about the report, but none of them felt sufficiently confident to go into the Kremlin and do what had to be done: request that Leonid Brezhnev play down the symbolism of the pending launch, so as to allow a decent delay for technical improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cosmonauts and bureaucrats eventually adopted an age-old technique. They recruited a nonpartisan messenger from outside the Soyuz program to deliver the document for them: Yuri Gagarin's K.G.B. friend Venyamin Russayev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Komarov invited me and my wife to visit his family," says Russayev. "Afterward, as he was seeing us off, 'Komarov said straight out, 'I'm not going to make it back from this flight.' As I knew the state of affairs, I asked him, 'If you're so convinced you're going to die, then why don't you refuse the mission?' He answered, 'If I don't make this flight, they'll send the backup pilot instead. That's Yura, and he'll die instead of me. We've got to take care of him.' . . . Komarov said he knew what he was talking about, and he burst into such bitter tears."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russayev could not be of much help on his own. Back at his desk in the Lubyanka the next morning, after a sleepless night, he decided to ask advice from one of his K.G.B. seniors, Major-General Konstantin Makharov, a man he respected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I went to Makharov's office and told him there was a serious problem with the rocket. He listened to me very carefully, and then he said, 'I'm going to do something. In the meantime don't leave your desk today. Not even for one second.' I kept my promise, and I'd only been back at my desk for a short while when he sent for me again. He gave me a letter, prepared by a team mobilized by Yuri Gagarin. Most of the cosmonauts took part in the research. Makharov told me to take the letter upstairs and see Ivan Fadyekin, head of Department Three."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This "letter" consisted of a 10-page document describing all 203 problems in the Soyuz hardware. As soon as he saw it, Fadyekin dodged the responsibility straight away. "I don't have the expertise for this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He redirected Russayev to a much more dangerous man in the Lubyanka: Georgi Tsinev. Tsinev was a close personal friend of Leonid Brezhnev; in fact, he was related by marriage, and they had fought alongside each other in the war. If anyone could deliver an important message straight into the hands of the First Secretary, Tsinev could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for Russayev, things were not quite that simple. Tsinev was rising fast within the K.G.B., helped along by his powerful patron in the Kremlin. He was not going to allow any irritations to disturb that cozy relationship. "While reading the letter, Tsinev looked at me, gauging my reactions to see if I'd read it or not," Russayev explains. "He was glaring at me very intently, watching me like a hawk, and suddenly he asked, 'How would you like a promotion up to my department?' He even offered me a better office."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tsinev kept hold of the document, and it was never seen again. Within weeks, Fadyekin was transferred to a junior consular office in Iran, merely for the crime of glancing through it. Makharov was fired immediately, without a pension, and Tsinev took over as chief of an entire counterintelligence department. Russayev was stripped of any responsibility for space affairs and transferred to an insignificant staff training department outside Moscow, well away from the Lubyanka. "I kept my head down like a hermit for the next 10 years," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April 23, 1967: Crash and Burn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on the morning of April 23, 1967, the Soyuz was propped up against the gantry at the Soviet launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, according to the original schedule. The journalist Golovanov noticed Gagarin behaving very strangely. "He demanded to be put into the protective spacesuit. It was already clear that Komarov was perfectly fit to fly, and there were only three or four hours remaining until liftoff time, but he suddenly burst out and started demanding this and that. It was a sudden caprice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russayev and others insist that Gagarin was trying to elbow his way onto the flight in order to save Komarov from almost certain death. Rumors about the dialogue between Komarov and ground control have circulated for many years, based on reports from the National Security Agency staff monitoring the radio signals from an Air Force facility near Istanbul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 1972 a former NSA analyst, interviewed under the name Winslow Peck (real name Perry Fellwock), gave a very moving account of the interception: "[The Soviet premier Alexei] Kosygin called Komarov personally. They had a videophone conversation, and Kosygin was crying. He told him he was a hero. . . . The guy's wife got on too. He told her how to handle their affairs and what to do with the kids."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he began his descent into the atmosphere, Komarov knew he was in terrible trouble. The radio outposts in Turkey picked up his cries of rage as he plunged to his death, cursing the people who had put him inside a botched spaceship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parachutes did not deploy properly. A small drogue canopy came out but failed to pull the bigger canopy from its storage bay. A backup parachute was released, only to become entangled with the first drogue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Komarov slammed onto the steppe near Orenburg with all the force of an unrestrained 2.8-ton meteorite. The capsule was utterly flattened, and the buffer retro rockets in its base blew up on impact, burning what little wreckage was left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovery troops picked up handfuls of soil to try and dampen the flames. Their radio messages back to base were garbled and distressed: something about the cosmonaut "requiring urgent medical attention."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russayev says a heel bone was found among the ashes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks after Komarov's death, Gagarin met Russayev at his family apartment but refused to speak in any of the rooms because he was worried about bugs. The lifts and lobby areas were not safe, either, so the two men trudged up and down the apartment block's echoing stairwells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gagarin of 1967 was very different from the carefree young man of 1961. Komarov's death had placed an enormous burden of guilt on his shoulders. At one point Gagarin said, "I must go to see the main man [Brezhnev] personally." He was profoundly depressed that he hadn't been able to persuade Brezhnev to cancel Komarov's launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before Gagarin left, the intensity of his anger became obvious. "I'll get through to him [Brezhnev] somehow, and if I ever find out he knew about the situation and still let everything happen, then I know exactly what I'm going to do." Russayev goes on, "I don't know exactly what Yuri had in mind. Maybe a good punch in the face.' " Russayev warned Gagarin to be cautious as far as Brezhnev was concerned. "I told him, 'Talk to me first before you do anything. I warn you, be very careful.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One story has it that Gagarin caught up with Brezhnev eventually and threw a drink in his face.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condition: 27 years old, 150 million miles traveled, somewhat dinged but well maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealer preparation and destination charges: $28.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, does anyone want to buy a used space shuttle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it turns out. This old vehicle -- the space shuttle Discovery -- is an object of fervent desire for museums around the country, which would love to add it or one of its mates, the Endeavour and the Atlantis, to their collections. (Financing terms can be arranged with NASA.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is to return from orbit on Wednesday, concluding its 39th flight and its space-faring career, but it will make at least one more ascent -- piggyback on a 747 airplane -- to its resting place for public display. NASA will announce the final destinations for the three soon-to-be-retired shuttles on April 12, the 30th anniversary of the first space shuttle launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the competing institutions have been campaigning energetically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visitor center at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston hired a marketing firm and set up a Web site, bringtheshuttlehome.com. Houston, the marketers argue, is the location of NASA's Mission Control, which guides the shuttles during flight. For the Texans, owning a space shuttle would be ''the modern-day equivalent of housing Columbus' famed ships -- the Nina, the Pinta or the Santa Maria,'' the Web site states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan has collected more than 150,000 names on a petition urging that one of the shuttles be placed there. ''New York City would make an ideal home for one of these retiring shuttles,'' the campaign asserts, noting that the spacecraft would be ''prominently displayed'' on Pier 86 in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Museum of Flight in Seattle has perhaps gone the furthest: this week, it erected the first wall of a new $12 million wing to house the shuttle it may never get. The museum's ''shuttle boosters'' Web site argues that Seattle has ''the right stuff'' because the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 747 was built there and 27 shuttle astronauts have called Washington home. (Officials at the Seattle museum say they have planned for the possibility of not getting a shuttle and would fill the space with other space artifacts.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one knows if these efforts, or dueling letters from various members of Congress, are exerting any sway on the top decision-maker at NASA, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who has said that he alone will decide where the shuttles end up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA says that 21 institutions have submitted proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're waiting,'' said Susan Marenoff, president of the Intrepid Museum. ''We're hoping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other hopefuls include the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the launching site of all of the shuttle missions; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; and the Museum of the United States Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio, which got a boost from President Obama's budget request for 2012 seeking $14 million to send a shuttle there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are more favorites than there are shuttles,'' said Robert Pearlman, editor of CollectSpace.com, a Web site for space history enthusiasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One museum that has been mum is the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. But that is because NASA already offered it the Discovery three years ago, and most expect the Discovery will go there. After concerns last year that the Smithsonian could not afford $28.8 million, Congress, in a budget bill passed in December, included a clause that specifically excuses the Smithsonian from those costs. If NASA offered a shuttle to the Smithsonian, the bill decreed, it would be ''at no or nominal cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Smithsonian, however, has been reticent about its intentions, and a spokeswoman offered only a short statement: ''The museum is involved in discussions with NASA about transfer of the orbiter and other artifacts from the shuttle program. The final disposition of shuttle artifacts will be the decision of NASA.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Discovery lands, only two shuttle flights remain. The Endeavour is scheduled to launch in April, and the Atlantis in June. Then the three will become museum pieces, with delivery expected next year. Each weighs about 170,000 pounds and is 122 feet long, with a wingspan of 78 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a fourth orbiter, the Enterprise, which was used for early glide tests but never went to space. The Air and Space Museum has the Enterprise on display at its spacious Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington-Dulles Airport. If the Discovery goes to the Smithsonian as expected, the Enterprise would likely get bumped to a new home, a consolation prize for one of the museums that did not receive a space-traveled shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, NASA inquired if any museums or other institutions had an interest in acquiring one of the three flying space shuttles. Potential bidders were told that educational programs had to accompany the exhibits, and that the shuttles had to reside in an indoor, climate-controlled environment. (NASA does not want to repeat the mistake at the end of the Apollo era, when the remaining Saturn V rockets rusted and decayed outdoors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, NASA has been mostly silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've not been contacted since we submitted,'' said Richard E. Allen Jr., chief executive of Space Center Houston, the visitor center at Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After it lands, the Discovery will go through a month of postflight rituals, like the removal of payloads. But then, instead of beginning preparations for another flight, workers will start primping it for its life as a tourist attraction. That work -- which accounts for most of the $28.8 million that NASA is charging -- will include cleaning or removing parts that have been contaminated by toxic propellants, and will likely take nine months to a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visitor complex at the Kennedy Space Center has proposed what would probably the most ambitious display: While most of the museums would have the orbiter sitting on the ground and build a fancy hangar around it, Kennedy would like to suspend it horizontally as if it were in Earth's orbit, with the payload doors open and the robotic arm sticking out. It would the centerpiece of a $100 million, 64,000-square-foot exhibit that would open in the second half of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to show it in flight,'' said William Moore, the chief operating officer of the visitor center, which operates under contract with NASA without government funding, ''and so the exhibit is really based around the shuttle working, because it's a working vehicle and has done a lot of great things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore said he was confident that his institution would be one of the recipients. ''You should be sure to call me back on April the 13th about how we feel when we get an orbiter,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, for all his confidence, Mr. Moore admitted that he had no idea what General Bolden was thinking. ''We read the newspaper a lot,'' he said. ''NASA has been very close-lipped about this. We really don't have any inside scoop at all.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The shuttle Discovery braved the hellish fire of re-entry for the last time Wednesday and glided back to Earth to close out the space plane's 39th and final voyage, an emotion-charged milestone marking the beginning of the end for America's shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dropping through a partly cloudy sky, the commander, Steven W. Lindsey, and Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force guided Discovery through a sweeping left overhead turn, lined up on Runway 15 and floated to a picture-perfect touchdown at 11:57 a.m. Eastern time to wrap up an extended 13-day space station assembly mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it coasted to a stop under a brilliant noon sun, Discovery had logged some 5,750 orbits covering nearly 150 million miles during 39 flights spanning a full year in space -- a record unrivaled in the history of manned rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And Houston, Discovery, for the final time, wheels stopped,'' Mr. Lindsey radioed flight controllers in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery, Houston, great job by you and your crew,'' replied Charles Hobaugh, an astronaut in mission control. ''That was a great landing in tough conditions, and it was an awesome docked mission you all had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lindsey and Colonel Boe were joined aboard Discovery by Benjamin Alvin Drew Jr.; Nicole P. Stott; Michael R. Barratt, a physician-astronaut; and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen of the Navy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As support crews swarmed onto the broad runway, engineers in the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building were busy preparing the shuttle Endeavour for rollout. The target date for Endeavour's 25th and final flight is April 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's remaining orbiter, the Atlantis, is scheduled for liftoff June 28 on the shuttle program's 135th flight, the final chapter in a post-Apollo initiative that produced what is arguably the most complex, capable and costly manned rockets ever built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a program come to a close here, and to see these shuttles, these beautiful, magnificent flying machines, end their service life is obviously a little bit sad for us,'' Dr. Barratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But it is about time -- they've lived a very long time, they've had a fabulous success record,'' he added. ''We look forward to seeing them retire with dignity and bringing on the next line of spaceships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sort of spaceship might ultimately replace the shuttle is an open question, and it is not yet clear how NASA will fare in the budget debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But between Atlantis's landing this summer and the debut of whatever vehicle replaces it -- several years from now at best -- the only way for American astronauts to reach orbit will be to hitch rides aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft at $55 million a seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a bitter pill for the thousands of men and women who have worked on the shuttle fleet over the past three decades, who now face layoffs and the prospect of seeing Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis -- the world's most sophisticated spacecraft -- turned into museum displays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We won't do anything nearly as complex with another vehicle for a very long time,'' Mr. Drew said. ''Five or 10 years from now, they're going to look back and say 'How did we ever build a vehicle that could do all these things?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late on St. Patrick's Day, Eastern time, a spacecraft called Messenger, weighing a little more than a thousand pounds, slipped into an elliptical orbit around the planet Mercury, becoming the only manmade object to orbit the planet closest to the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the coming days, scientists from NASA and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory will check Messenger's systems and begin turning on its instruments. On April 4, observations begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger spent nearly seven years in transit and traveled about five billion miles. It will spend one Earth-year studying the mineralogy of Mercury, mapping its surface and magnetic and gravitational fields, and trying to identify the substance covering the planet's north pole. All the while, a ceramic-fabric sunshade will be protecting Messenger from the ferocious heat of the nearby Sun and the solar reflection from Mercury. The craft will eventually plummet into the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It really doesn't matter how many space missions you've followed or how many Hubble photographs you've marveled over. There is still a sense of raw excitement about reaching a critical stage in an expedition like this, an excitement that will only grow as data begins to stream toward Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the thrill is knowing that this is the pure pursuit of knowledge, the scientific impulse -- a human impulse -- carried to a remarkable conclusion. It's hard to know just what we will learn about Mercury. Like all scientific missions and experiments, this is a journey to a more refined sense of what we don't yet know.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I REMEMBER the first time the concept of another world entered my mind. It was during a walk with my father in our garden in Sri Lanka. He pointed to the Moon and told me that people had walked on it. I was astonished: Suddenly that bright light became a place that one could visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schoolchildren may feel a similar sense of wonder when they see pictures of a Martian landscape or Saturn's rings. And soon their views of alien worlds may not be confined to the planets in our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After millenniums of musings and a century of failed attempts, astronomers first detected an exoplanet, a planet orbiting a normal star other than the Sun, in 1995. Now they are finding hundreds of such worlds each year. Last month, NASA announced that 1,235 new possible planets had been observed by Kepler, a telescope on a space satellite. Six of the planets that Kepler found circle one star, and the orbits of five of them would fit within that of Mercury, the closest planet to our Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By timing the passages of these five planets across their sun's visage -- which provides confirmation of their planetary nature -- we can witness their graceful dance with one another, choreographed by gravity. These discoveries remind us that nature is often richer and more wondrous than our imagination. The diversity of alien worlds has surprised us and challenged our preconceptions many times over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is quite a change from merely 20 years ago, when we knew for sure of just one planetary system: ours. The pace of discovery, supported by new instruments and missions and innovative strategies by planet seekers, has been astounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, from measurements of their masses and sizes, we can infer what some of these worlds are made of: gases, ice or rocks. Astronomers have been able to take the temperature of planets around other stars, first with telescopes in space but more recently with ground-based instruments, as my collaborators and I have done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two and a half years ago, we even managed to capture the first direct pictures of alien worlds. There is something about a photo of an alien planet -- even if it only appears as a faint dot next to a bright, overexposed star -- that makes it ''real.'' Given that stars shine like floodlights next to the planetary embers huddled around them, success required painstaking efforts and clever innovations. One essential tool is adaptive optics technology, which, in effect, takes the twinkle out of the stars, thus providing sharper images from telescopes on the ground than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the crux of this grand pursuit is one basic question: Is our warm, wet, rocky world, teeming with life, the exception or the norm? It is an important question for every one of us, not just for scientists. It seems absurd, if not arrogant, to think that ours is the only life-bearing world in the galaxy, given hundreds of billions of other suns, the apparent ubiquity of planets, and the cosmic abundance of life's ingredients. It may be that life is fairly common, but that ''intelligent'' life is rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the vast majority of the extra-solar worlds discovered to date are quite unlike our own: many are gas giants, and some are boiling hot while others endure everlasting chills. Just a handful are close in size to our planet, and only a few of those may be rocky like the Earth, rather than gaseous like Jupiter or icy like Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within the next few years, astronomers expect to find dozens of alien earths that are roughly the size of our planet. Some of them will likely be in the so-called habitable zone, where the temperatures are just right for liquid water. The discovery of ''Earth twins,'' with conditions similar to what we find here, will inevitably bring questions about alien life to the forefront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detecting signs of life elsewhere will not be easy, but it may well occur in my lifetime, if not during the next decade. Given the daunting distances between the stars, the real-life version will almost certainly be a lot less sensational than the movies depicting alien invasions or crash-landing spaceships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence may be circumstantial at first -- say, spectral bar codes of interesting molecules like oxygen, ozone, methane and water -- and leave room for alternative interpretations. It may take years of additional data-gathering, and perhaps the construction of new telescopes, to satisfy our doubts. Besides, we won't know whether such ''biosignatures'' are an indication of slime or civilization. Most people will likely move on to other, more immediate concerns of life here on Earth while scientists get down to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, on the other hand, an alien radio signal were to be detected, that would constitute a more clear-cut and exciting moment. Even if the contents of the message remained elusive for decades, we would know that there was someone ''intelligent'' at the other end. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence with radio telescopes has come of age recently, 50 years after the first feeble attempt. The construction of the Allen Telescope Array on an arid plateau in northern California greatly expands the number of star systems from which astronomers could detect signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However it arrives, the first definitive evidence of life elsewhere will mark a turning point in our intellectual history, perhaps only rivaled by Copernicus's heliocentric theory or Darwin's theory of evolution. If life can spring up on two planets independently, why not on a thousand or even a billion others? The ramifications of finding out for sure that ours isn't the only inhabited world are likely to be felt, over time, in many areas of human thought and endeavor -- from biology and philosophy to religion and art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people worry that discovering life elsewhere, especially if it turns out to be in possession of incredible technology, will make us feel small and insignificant. They seem concerned that it will constitute a horrific blow to our collective ego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I happen to be an optimist. It may take decades after the initial indications of alien life for scientists to gather enough evidence to be certain or to decipher a signal of artificial origin. The full ramifications of the discovery may not be felt for generations, giving us plenty of time to get used to the presence of our galactic neighbors. Besides, knowing that we are not alone just might be the kick in the pants we need to grow up as a species.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's really hot, really cold and maybe even a bit icy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the planet Mercury, and this month it is ready for its extended close-up. On Wednesday, NASA showed off the first pictures taken by its Mercury Messenger spacecraft since entering the planet's orbit on March 17. The Messenger is to spend at least a year photographing, measuring and studying Mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit to Mercury is the last frontier of planetary exploration that NASA will reach for quite some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the last of the classical planets, the planets known to the astronomers of Egypt and Greece and Rome and the Far East,'' said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the mission's principal investigator. ''It's an object that has captivated the imagination and the attention of astronomers for millennia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But never before has science had such a good front-row seat. ''We're there now,'' Dr. Solomon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency has sent orbiters to five planets -- Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn -- but it will most likely be another decade or two before a spacecraft enters orbit around Uranus or Neptune. (A study on future planetary missions put a Uranus orbiter on the wish list.) NASA does have a spacecraft, New Horizons, that will zoom past Pluto in 2015, but, alas, Pluto is no longer counted as a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury has been seen close up, albeit briefly, in half a dozen flybys by NASA probes: three by the Mariner 10 in the 1970s and three by the Messenger in the last three years. But now that the Messenger has pulled into an orbit of Mercury, planetary scientists will be able to get their first long look at the smallest of the eight planets. The day side of Mercury can broil at 800 degrees Fahrenheit; the night side drops to minus 300 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly intriguing, scientists say, are the shadows in craters near Mercury's poles. There, the Sun never shines, and in the frigidity, some scientists expect that the Messenger will find frozen water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Messenger arrived at its final destination after a 6.5-year loop the loop through the inner solar system. A 15-minute engine burn slowed the spacecraft sufficiently for it to be captured by Mercury's gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, the Messenger loops around the planet on a highly elliptical orbit, dipping down as close to 160 miles to Mercury's surface and rising as far up as 9,300 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its arrival, engineers have been checking out the orbiter's systems and gear. Finding everything in working order, they turned on the instruments, including the camera. The first picture, showing a bright crater called Debussy, was taken early Tuesday. By the end of Thursday, 1,500 photographs will have been taken. More than 75,000 are planned over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's seven instruments have also begun measuring emissions of neutrons, X-rays and gamma rays, which will allow scientists to deduce many of the minerals of the surface. The extended observation will help them understand how Mercury, which is half the mass of Mars, still has a magnetic field -- presumably generated by a molten outer core -- while Mars does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James W. Head III, a geology professor at Brown University and an investigator on the Messenger mission, said Mercury could even give clues about how plate tectonics -- the motion of pieces of crust -- started on Earth. On other bodies, like Mars and the Earth's moon, there is no sign of plate tectonics, with the crust remaining in one piece. On Mercury, however, there are long tectonic ridges extending thousands of miles, which could have represented the first stage of the crust breaking up into plates, although the pieces never started moving as on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of embryonic, halted,'' Dr. Head said. ''It didn't quite get going, but it could give us clues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will officially begin its scientific measurements on Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has produced a very nice video tribute to the SeaWiFS orbiting sensor, which provided vast amounts of valuable data on Earth's waters, plant life and weather from 1997 through 2010. The video is narrated by Gene Feldman, an oceanographer at the Goddard Space Flight Center:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">.The mission was originally conceived to track ocean color as an indirect indicator of chlorophyll (and thus plankton or plant life). But the instrument was adjusted before launch so that it could also monitor changes in the color of terrestrial vegetation. The agency has posted a fascinating backgrounder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's more for "Mission to Earth" geeks (I count myself as one) over at the Earth Observatory Web site, where SeaWiFS merits the "Image of the Day" -- a view of Earth showing the averaged chlorophyll concentration in the oceans from 1998 through 2010 (and of course showing all that glorious green terrestrial plant life, too):</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final preparations were underway Monday evening at the Baikonur space center to launch a rocket in honor of the 50th anniversary of the flight of the first person in space, Yuri A. Gagarin. Two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut are scheduled to ride the Yuri Gagarin rocket into orbit, on their way to the International Space Station; the honorary naming was a departure from the usual Russian practice of numbering rockets. The rocket, scheduled to launch before Tuesday, also has a portrait of Mr. Gagarin painted on the side. He was only 27 years old when he made his first and only journey into space, and he later died in a jet airplane crash. The Soyuz model booster was being fueled Monday evening on the same launch pad where Mr. Gagarin blasted off on his flight on April 12, 1961, which began with his words ''Let's go.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOVIET sculpture renders all its subjects larger than life, but few more so than Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space on April 12, 1961, nearly 50 years ago. A gleaming, 125-foot-tall titanium statue of the world's most famous cosmonaut stands at the nexus of three freeways in Moscow, arms outstretched like a cold war superhero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin's achievement, and the Soviet playbook that shaped it, made him the most celebrated Soviet hero since Lenin, a triumph of nationalist glory, a role model for the young, a hypermasculine sex symbol. His deification set the ''right stuff'' tone that NASA would follow with its own astronauts: the lumbering icons in their puffy, complicated suits, incapable of error or weakness or even, it sometimes seemed, emotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, Gagarin was 5 feet 2 inches tall and nice as heck. He was chosen because of his willingness to follow orders, to be a small part of the technological immensity of the Soviet space program. It is this quality, rather than courage or bravado, that makes him, in a sense, a most modern spacefarer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin was, to be sure, the model Soviet citizen. When I visited the Yuri Gagarin museum in Star City, near Moscow, the curator showed me his childhood report cards, ''all with excellent marks,'' and a toy airplane he made at the industrial school he attended as a boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for all his precocious talent, the space program's chief designer, Sergey Korolev, is reported to have chosen Gagarin for the history-making mission partly because he was the only one of the original cosmonaut squad to remove his shoes before stepping inside a model of the Vostok I capsule in which he would travel into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody liked him,'' said the curator, fanning herself as though overcome by the mere thought of him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Gagarin's affable willingness to go with the program made him perfect for a mission in which he was, essentially, human cargo. Beyond coming down alive -- nailing it first -- his only assignment was to write down his observations and sensations (which he mostly failed to do, because he inadvertently let go of his pencil in orbit, and it floated out of sight).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the chimpanzees and the Moscow street mutts that went into space before them, Gagarin and other early spacemen were in part an experimental payload. There was a great deal of concern, at both the Soviet space agency and at NASA, about the unknown physiological and psychological consequences of space and zero gravity. Would breaching the infinite blow the crewman's mind? Would weightlessness cause his eyeballs to change shape, his blood to stop circulating? Gagarin went up to find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strangely, the first man to ascend into the cosmos was a skilled pilot forbidden to use his skills. The controls of Vostok I were locked; the capsule was maneuvered entirely from the ground. As Gagarin himself put it, ''I'm not sure if I was the first man in space or the last dog.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing about Gagarin's personality prevented him from becoming a Soviet demigod. His museum holds hundreds of official gifts and honors bestowed on him during the 27-nation tour that followed his flight: case after case of plaques and medals and proclamations and keys, a sombrero from the president of Mexico, giant salad tongs from who knows where.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin was uncomfortable with the adulation and fuss. He wrote in his autobiography of noticing that his shoelace was untied while he walked the red carpet before the presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and being unable to think about anything else. When he found himself seated beside Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace luncheon, he reached under the table and squeezed her knee -- not out of lasciviousness but, Gagarin biographer Lev Danilkin told me, ''to receive evidence that he was not sleeping.'' (Her Majesty pretended not to notice.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contemporary space travelers have hewed closer to the real-life Yuri Gagarin than his larger-than-life public image. Whatever bravado was tolerated during NASA's earliest manned space programs has been ironed out; in an era of large-crew, long-duration missions, it is very much the wrong stuff. There is no room for expansive egos, for swagger and machismo, on a year-long stay in a bus-sized space station habitat or a two-plus-year mission to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent list of desirable attributes in NASA astronauts includes empathy, fairness and a good sense of humor. It's hard to say whether and when the United States will send a human being to Mars, but Yuri Gagarin would be as perfect a choice today as he was in 1961.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONGTIME stargazers learned the basics of the night sky the hard way -- with pencils, star charts and lots of patience with their telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now high-tech equipment and smartphone apps are making the task a lot less daunting for beginners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New point-and-shoot telescopes, for example, require only the push of a button to go into action: Plunk one down in the driveway and the device gets its own bearings, aligning itself with the stars above so it can tell you that the twinkling light in the eyepiece is Betelgeuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three models of these new, self-aligning telescopes, costing about $700 to $800, will be offered this July by Celestron. The company's new line, called SkyProdigy, is intended for amateurs who don't have in-depth knowledge of the night sky, or may not even have a clue of how to set up a telescope, said Danyal J. Medley, a principal engineer at the company in Torrance, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even seasoned astronomy experts are heralding such automation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the telescope that sets itself up, so anyone can easily use it, is great,'' said Jay Pasachoff, chairman of the astronomy department and director of the Hopkins Observatory at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. ''This kind of telescope makes it possible for people to be out in their backyards and look at the most interesting astronomical objects within minutes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find its position and then recognize the stars above, the telescope has a digital camera that takes pictures of the sky. It then compares them with its computerized database of stored images, Mr. Medley said. The process typically takes less than three minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automated telescopes that can find celestial objects with no help from humans are not new. Telescopes have long had motors to drive them, allowing built-in processing and databases. Users of some older telescopes, for example, can choose ''Saturn'' from the menu on the hand controller, recentering the eyepiece over the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even these go-to telescopes, as they are known, must be set up properly, said Tom Kovach, customer service manager at Astronomics.com, based in Norman, Okla. ''It only takes a few minutes to do this,'' he said, ''but you have to be technically savvy, and some people are defeated by the process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celestron's line, as well as the LightSwitch line from <span class="companylink">Meade Instruments</span> in Irvine, Calif., fills that last niche in automation, he said. ''The go-to's make it easier, but they are only as good as the alignment you give them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amateur stargazers are also finding a wealth of data via low-cost technology like smartphone apps. Smartphones, with their cameras and abundant processing power, offer novel features that telescopes cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, United Soft Media offers the app Redshift for iPhone and iPad ($11.99 at iTunes) that identifies bright stars or planets you can see in the night sky. It can also simulate a ride on a spacecraft taking you on a tour of distant planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the App Smart column of The New York Times reviewed several other astronomy-related apps including Star Walk ($3 for the iPhone; $5 for the iPad) and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Sky Map for Android phones (free).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smartphone apps and accessories for stargazing are so popular that they will have a separate block of vendors at the Northeast Astronomy Forum and Telescope Show, to be held April 16 and 17 in Suffern, N.Y., said Alan Traino, chairman of the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apps can lead to more telescope sales, said Mr. Kovach of Astronomics.com. ''People come in with their phones,'' he said, on which they have looked at labeled versions of the night sky. ''They say, 'I want to get a telescope to see this for real' .''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR those who want to meld the benefits of telescopes with smartphones, attachments are available. A simple adapter, the MX-1 from Magnilux ($45 at magnilux.com), clamps an iPhone directly onto the telescope eyepiece, said Robert Buchanan, the president of the company, based in West Melbourne, Fla. With that, users can take snapshots of Saturn, the moon, Jupiter and other bright objects via the telescope. ''You won't get distant galaxies,'' he said, ''but it will get you started.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael L. Weasner, an amateur astronomer in <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>, Ariz., tried the MX-1 with his telescopes, as well as with binoculars and other devices. ''You can say to friends you have over: 'Come and look at this. I have a picture of the moon.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chris Lintott, director of citizen science at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, said he believed that the availability of beginners' tools like apps and self-aligning telescopes would help drive interest in astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People can find out much more easily what that bright thing in the sky is that interests them,'' he said. ''And once they've found out that bright star is a planet, I think it's natural to want to learn more about it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space shuttle is coming to Manhattan, but not one of the three that have carried astronauts into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum is getting the fourth shuttle, the Enterprise, according to a person who had been briefed on the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Enterprise was the consolation prize in the contest to obtain one of the three orbiters that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to give away after wrapping up the Space Shuttle program. One of those three, the Discovery, has been promised to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. It would be displayed at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, near Washington Dulles International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Enterprise, which was the first shuttle built though it never flew into space, is currently on display there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., is scheduled to announce where the retired shuttles are going during a news conference in Florida on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intrepid museum officials have said they plan to house the shuttle in a building they will construct on Pier 86, next to the decommissioned aircraft carrier that houses the museum. They have estimated that the shuttle could draw as many as a million sightseers to the city. To make room, the museum would probably have to move a retired Concorde supersonic jet that now sits on the end of the pier, which juts into the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes the hard part: raising the money to pay for the Enterprise. The space agency's latest estimate of the cost of preparing and delivering one of the used shuttles was $28.8 million; the Enterprise, which is already on display, should require less work. Intrepid officials have not yet identified any sources of funds for the project and city officials have indicated to them that the city is in no position to offer much financial assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's two senators, Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, lobbied hard for New York City to get one of the shuttles. But they were in a fierce competition with elected officials from several other states, including Florida, Texas, Ohio and Washington.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's space shuttles, which have been carrying astronauts aloft for 30 years, were assigned to their final destinations on Tuesday: one will head to the nation's capital, another to Los Angeles, and the third from its current home at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to the center's visitor complex next door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a ceremony commemorating the shuttle program, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, made the long-awaited announcement of where the soon-to-be museum pieces would end up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery, which completed its final flight last month, is headed to the Smithsonian, for display at the spacious Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington Dulles International Airport. The Endeavour, currently on the launching pad for its final space trip, will go to the California Science Center. The Atlantis, scheduled for its last mission in June, will go to the Kennedy visitor complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The audience at the Kennedy ceremony erupted into cheering and whooping as General Bolden announced the Atlantis's destination. ''I guess I got something right today,'' the general said with a laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conspicuous among the unsuccessful hopefuls were the Museum of Flight in Seattle, which had already begun construction of a wing that it hoped would house an orbiter; the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio; and NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas, the site of mission control for the 135 shuttle missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointment in Houston was pronounced. Representative Pete Olson, a Republican whose district includes the space center, said in a statement, ''This oversight smacks of a political gesture in an agency that has always served above politics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Discovery headed to the Smithsonian, the museum will no longer have need for the Enterprise, the shuttle that has been on display there since 2003. The Enterprise, which was used for early glide tests but was never sent into orbit, will now go the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-one institutions across the country had put in bids for one of the orbiters, and in recent weeks, General Bolden was inundated with letters and phone calls from members of Congress and others advocating various sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were many, many worthy institutions that requested an orbiter, and only four to go around,'' General Bolden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced on Tuesday that hundreds of other pieces of hardware from the shuttle program would be heading to various museums. The Seattle museum, for example, will not receive a flown orbiter, but it will get a full-size mock-up that is now at the Johnson Space Center and is used for astronaut training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had been expected to make its museum choices last year, but that was when the final shuttle flight had been scheduled for last September. As the schedule for the final missions was stretched out, so were the preparations for the shuttles' post-flying careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, General Bolden chose Tuesday for the announcement to coincide with the anniversaries of two historic moments in space flight: the 50th anniversary of the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who was the first human in space, and the 30th anniversary of the first launching of a space shuttle, the Columbia, in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two shuttles -- and the astronauts aboard -- were lost in the last 30 years. The Challenger disintegrated upon liftoff in January 1986 because of a leaky booster rocket, and 17 years later, the Columbia broke up as it returned to Earth because of wing damage caused by falling insulating foam during liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the Columbia, President George W. Bush decided to resume flying the three remaining shuttles -- the Discovery, the Atlantis and the Endeavour, which had been built as a replacement for the Challenger -- but then to retire them as soon as construction of the International Space Station was complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA inquired a few years ago whether any museums or other institutions had an interest in acquiring a shuttle. Potential bidders were told that educational programs would have to accompany the exhibits, and that the shuttles would have to reside in an indoor, climate-controlled environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning institutions will now have to negotiate with NASA over the cost, estimated at $28.8 million apiece, of preparing the shuttles for display and moving them to their destinations. But not all of them will have to find that much money: Congress exempted the Smithsonian, and the transportation costs for the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex -- instead of traveling piggyback on a 747, the Atlantis is to be towed just a short way down the road -- will be significantly lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the orbiters may go on a farewell tour. NASA is looking into ''possibly taking them on a tour around various locations throughout the country while they're en route to their final destinations,'' said Michael Curie, a spokesman for the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA expects to deliver the shuttles next year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>780 words</div><div>19 April 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced Monday that it was distributing $269 million to four companies to develop spacecraft to take its astronauts to orbit in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The awards, part of what NASA calls its commercial crew development program, are a bet, pushed by the Obama administration, that commercial companies will be able to get people to and from orbit more quickly and less expensively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip McAlister, acting director of the program, said NASA received 22 proposals and sought additional information on 8 of them before deciding on the winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif., which already has a contract to carry cargo to the International Space Station, will receive $75 million toward making its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule suitable for passengers. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had two successful launchings of its Falcon 9 last year, the second with an empty Dragon capsule that successfully orbited the planet before parachuting back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span> of Louisville, Colo., will receive $80 million for its small space plane design, and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> will receive $92.3 million for a capsule design. Blue Origin, a quiet, enigmatic company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, will receive $22 million to work on its capsule design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For each of the companies, the money will finance one year of work beginning in May, and the companies will be paid as they meet milestones outlined in their proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another winner -- even though NASA did not give it any money -- may be the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>. Except for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the other companies need a rocket to fly their spacecraft, and the alliance's Atlas V rocket is a likely choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also passed over a proposal from <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>. to develop a commercial version of the Ares I rocket, which Alliant said would cost much less than an Atlas V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This second round of commercial crew development awards is NASA's biggest step so far in breaking away from its past practice of developing and operating its own spacecraft like the space shuttles and before that the behemoth Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttles are retired this year, the United States will have to rely on the Russians, at a cost of more than $50 million a seat, for taking NASA astronauts to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McAlister said NASA was aiming for commercial providers to begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station in the ''middle part of the decade,'' although that depended on future financing from NASA and the companies meeting their technical goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are hopefully going to make a lot of progress over this next year so we can get there as soon as we can,'' Mr. McAlister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next phase, NASA is to hold a competition to provide crew transportation services, which will be open to all companies, not just the ones that received money in the current round. NASA is still working on details of how the competition would be set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The strategy is still in development,'' Mr. McAlister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had been developing its own follow-on rocket to the shuttles, the Ares I, as part of an ambitious program to send astronauts back to the Moon. But the Obama administration decided that effort cost too much and moved to cancel it and the Ares I last year. Instead, it wanted to spend $6 billion over five years to finance commercial crew efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, NASA awarded $50 million in its first round of financing for commercial crew development. In his request for the next fiscal year's budget, President Obama asked for $850 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many members of Congress remain skeptical of the commercial crew approach. While a blueprint for NASA's priorities over the next three years passed last year includes money for commercial crew, it also includes much more money for NASA to develop a larger capsule and a big rocket for missions beyond low-Earth orbit. Congress also wanted the NASA rocket and capsule as a backup in case the commercial efforts failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While I know that commercial companies could eventually become successful,'' Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said during a hearing last week, ''I do not feel that the information available justifies such a large investment of federal dollars this year for commercial vehicles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With tight budgets, it is not clear how NASA can accomplish everything it has been asked to do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine that someone offered to dump 1,100 busted washing machines onto a prime piece of riverfront property in Midtown Manhattan, pitching the idea as a potential tourist draw and educational attraction. New Yorkers are smart. Many -- perhaps even most -- of them would say: ''Are you kidding me? You're just looking for an easy way to get rid of 150,000 pounds of junk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same response if the offer was for 499,000 first-generation iPhones or 11,000 broken toaster ovens, all of which would also weigh about 150,000 pounds. Yet the other day, when the city got word that another 150,000-pound castoff was headed this way, moderate rejoicing broke out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum was awarded custody of the Enterprise, the space shuttle that, until now, had been on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington. The Smithsonian is going to get one of the newly retired space shuttles (one of the real ones; read on) and so is magnanimously regifting this one. It is to go on display near the great ship, which, come to think of it, is another federal hand-me-down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not for a minute suggesting that the Intrepid, an aircraft carrier with a distinguished record of service in war and in peace, is anything less than a credit to Pier 86. The Enterprise, though, is a bit of a downgrade; it's a prototype that never actually flew in space, never docked with anything and never harbored Sigourney Weaver and slimy parasitic aliens. From there it's just a short step to federal junk with no historic value at all -- misprinted tax forms, past-date hardtack, obsolete nuclear missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor am I saying that the thing won't attract tourists, because, as 18 years' worth of ''Cats'' proved, tourists will apparently pay to see just about anything. It's just the precedent I'm worried about, especially now, when Washington politicians are eager to get rid of any evidence of their wasteful ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, you're saying, 20 other suitors were going after the Enterprise and the three real shuttles (which went to Cape Canaveral, Fla; Los Angeles; and Washington). Could all of them really have been hoodwinked? Are the feds really smart enough to fool that many people into vying for the right to take government discards? Remember, this is NASA we're talking about; these folks put men on the moon back when most Americans still had black-and-white televisions and thought that electric can openers were the pinnacle of technological achievement. Yeah, they're smart enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to worry, though. If the federal government is going to make a habit of dumping its castoffs here, we have people who can turn that into a positive. They're called artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of artists create the old-fashioned way, by painting, taking a photograph or hiring models to stand naked in the Museum of Modern Art, but there's a subset of them who make art out of other people's throwaways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Trash speaks to me,'' Barbara Lubliner of Manhattan, one such artist, told me by way of explaining how to go about turning junk into art. ''It says: 'I've got potential. Give me new context. Keep me around until you can vision me in a new life.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lubliner is among more than 50 artists contributing to an exhibition opening this weekend at the Williamsburg Art and Historical Center in Brooklyn called ''Art From Detritus: Upcycling With Imagination,'' in which all the works are made from recycled materials and trash. Figuring that you've got to have a sense of humor to make artwork out of trash, I asked a few of these artists to ruminate both on what it takes to turn junk into something someone might want to look at and on what they would do with a used space shuttle if given one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd use it as an art studio,'' Ms. Lubliner said. Bernard Klevickas, a sculptor in Long Island City, Queens, whose work is also in the show, was equally utilitarian. ''Start a community garden in it,'' he said. ''The bay doors could be removed and a greenhouse roof installed for the winter season. The shuttle would in essence become a giant planter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's Chris Noel, who makes what he calls debris paintings using detritus of various sorts. He's not part of the Williamsburg show and lives in Maryland. So what's he doing in this column? He lived for years in Virginia, one of the states where New York has been dumping its trash for some time. And so, as an oblique what-goes-around-comes-around gesture, I'm giving him the last word, to relate what he'd do with a discarded shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe I would convert it into a land yacht and tour the country,'' Mr. Noel said. ''Along the way, I would ask all those I came in contact with to make their mark on it in some way, no matter how large or small. I would travel until there was not a speck of unmarked space, and then I would park it and declare it finished. I don't think an item as significant as this should be entrusted to any one individual. This should be the people's art. Then you either park it or send it into space for its final voyage, never to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''O.K., that's kind of thick with peace, love and harmony,'' he added, ''but maybe that's not so bad.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens when you have the right stuff at the wrong time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of NASA's astronaut corps have been asking just that, now that the space shuttle program is ending and their odds of flying anywhere good anytime soon are getting smaller. The Endeavour is scheduled to launch this week, and the Atlantis is supposed to fly the last shuttle mission in June -- and all the seats are spoken for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Morale is pretty low,'' said Leroy Chiao, a former astronaut who now works for a company that wants to offer space flights for tourists. ''This is a time of great uncertainty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under President Obama, NASA's human spaceflight program has been curtailed. The Ares I and Constellation programs, which were meant to succeed the space shuttles and take astronauts to the moon, were canceled, and NASA is instead hiring outside companies to devise alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when the Obama family heads to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week to sit with Gabrielle Giffords, the injured Arizona congresswoman, as she watches her husband, Capt. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, take off for the International Space Station, it will be one of the last spectacles of its kind for a while. Over the next few years, American astronauts will be competing for a handful of slots on the International Space Station, flying there on Russian Soyuz capsules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We hope we will overcome this hurdle and continue to explore,'' said Peggy A. Whitson, the head of NASA's astronaut office, whose job includes selecting the astronauts who will fly each space mission. While people's spirits are a little down, she said, ''we'll have to see -- NASA has gone through different phases like this before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current situation may not dampen the career aspirations of the elementary school set, but last year alone, 20 astronauts left NASA's active-duty roster; today, 61 remain, down from a peak of about 150 in 2000. Back then, NASA was gearing up to staff the International Space Station and the shuttles that supplied it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift has made a big difference to people like John M. Grunsfeld, the Dr. Fix-It of the Hubble Space Telescope, who has flown five missions for NASA. After his last flight, in May 2009, he asked Dr. Whitson about his chances of returning to space. ''She was honest,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Slim to none.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Whitson had dangled even a small chance at a plum assignment, like commanding the International Space Station, ''I probably would have stayed,'' said Dr. Grunsfeld, 52. But she did not. So in January 2010, he left NASA to become deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another astronaut for whom the new realities presented a problem was Capt. Scott D. Altman of the Navy, who has flown four missions for NASA. But at 6-foot-4, he does not fit into a Soyuz capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his last shuttle flight in 2009, Captain Altman, 51, saw the writing on the wall. As he wrestled with the decision over whether to leave NASA, the Obama administration made the decision to scrap Constellation and Ares I. He announced last August that he would depart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving NASA ''was the right decision,'' Captain Altman said, but ''there are some regrets from time to time.'' He now works for ASRC Research and Technology Solutions in Maryland, which does engineering work for NASA and other federal agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will still be hiring astronauts, though not people of Captain Altman's vintage. In the next year or two, as more people leave or retire, the agency will recruit a new class of 6 to 12 astronauts, Dr. Whitson said. If NASA decides to reduce tours of duty at the space station from six months to four, that would mean a need for even more astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We briefed the entire office on what to expect,'' said Dr. Whitson, who is herself an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, opportunities for astronauts outside of NASA are small but growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic, part of Richard Branson's empire, is seeking three space pilots for its SpaceShipTwo rocket plane, which may begin space tourism trips next year. While SpaceShipTwo will take suborbital hops that provide only a few minutes of weightlessness, other companies -- like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, better known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- are developing spacecraft that will be able to fly to the International Space Station and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrett E. Reisman, who joined the astronaut corps in 1998, left NASA last month for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which was founded by the Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk. Dr. Reisman had logged more than three months in space and done work on the space station's robotic arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being an astronaut is the coolest job ever,'' said Dr. Reisman, 43. ''It was very, very difficult to voluntarily leave.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Reisman had stayed at NASA, he would have had a chance to fly again, but he decided to move on. Now he is working on a rocket (the Falcon 9) and a spacecraft (the Dragon) that are meant to take passengers and cargo to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an engineer's dream to design a spaceship,'' he said. ''To me, it seems like we're on the verge of a golden age of spaceflight -- that's where I wanted to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For every astronaut who quits NASA because of age or a lack of opportunity, there are any number of young people aspiring to fill their shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job is still as romantic as the standards are stringent. According to NASA's Web site, astronaut candidates must be able to swim three lengths of a pool in a flight suit and tennis shoes; an advanced degree in science or math is a plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The requirements are even stricter for people who want to work in the space station: you must speak Russian, know robotics, be trained for spacewalks and be healthy enough to spend six months in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This formidable checklist has helped NASA nudge some astronauts aside. But it has not dulled anyone's memories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being in space is like being someplace magic,'' said Col. Pamela Ann Melroy of the Air Force, the second female astronaut to command a shuttle mission. She left NASA in 2009, knowing that there would be intense jockeying by astronauts seeking to command one of the few remaining flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't really want to get into situation where I was hanging around hoping that I would get one of them,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Melroy is still wistful about the lost prospect of flying on the Ares I. ''That would have been a hoot,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty years ago, NASA launched Columbia, the first space shuttle, on a two-day mission to circle Earth's orbit. Since then, more than 130 shuttle missions on five different shuttles have carried more than 350 astronauts to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On these missions, astronauts have helped build and maintain the International Space Station, repaired the Hubble Space Telescope, launched numerous exploratory spacecraft and conducted science experiments in science, plant biology, human health and countless other fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To commemorate the end of this era, we present a nine-question quiz about the Space Transportation System, popularly known as the space shuttle program. The quiz is intended to function as a fact scavenger hunt, like a WebQuest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give students all available resources to find answers to the questions, including relevant periodicals and Internet access to informative sites, including the New York Times archives. The Times Topics pages on National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Space Shuttle are useful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quiz can be done in its entirety by individuals or teams, or the class can be divided into nine small groups, with each group taking on one question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is a space shuttle? Describe and illustrate the main parts of a space shuttle and explain the function of each part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the mission of NASA's space shuttle program? Why did NASA choose to build and maintain a fleet of space shuttles? NASA has used shuttles to send unmanned spacecraft on missions throughout the solar system. These spacecraft include the exploratory probes Magellan and Galileo as well as the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. What were the destinations of these spacecrafts, and what have we learned from the data they collected and sent back to Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle might be best known for its role in launching, maintaining and repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. What have we learned about space from images collected with the Hubble telescope?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts have described space as an "alien" environment where things behave quite differently than they do on Earth. What properties make that the case? Describe three ways in which materials behave differently in space than on Earth because of these properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What kinds of scientific questions have scientists explored on the space shuttle by taking advantage of the unusual properties of space? Describe three areas of shuttle-based research, and explain how these experiments relate to real-world problems on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration by its very nature is a risky undertaking, and space exploration is no exception. Twice in the history of the space shuttle program, the shuttle and the entire crew on board were lost in accidents. What have investigators learned about the probable causes of these disasters?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why do many astronauts call the return to Earth's atmosphere one of the riskiest moments in space travel, and how does the design of a space shuttle minimize this risk?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is NASA retiring the space shuttle program? Will NASA continue to send humans into space? If so, how? If not, why not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When students are confident that they have found what they believe to be reliable answers, have the entire class share both their findings and the sources they used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conclude by discussing what the end of the space shuttle program means for NASA, for astronauts, for science and for the country. Quote from the Kenneth Chang article "With 'Coolest Job Ever' Ending, Astronauts Seek Next Frontier" to provide specific prompts for students to respond to, like the comment that "morale is pretty low" among astronauts. Have any students in the class ever dreamed of being astronauts? Do they still aspire to go into space one day?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Museum of Flight in Seattle had anticipated for years that it would receive for its new $12 million, 15,000-square-foot Space Gallery one of four space shuttles that NASA was to give away. But when the winners were announced this month, Seattle was not among them. Instead, the museum will get a shuttle trainer used by astronauts before they went into space. It is made of plywood and does not have wings. Douglas R. King, the museum's chief executive, discusses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You had been planning for a shuttle for years. You had legislators pushing for it. You built a special climate-controlled building. What happened?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, there's only four of them. We've actually been working on this for 10 years -- longer, even. We wanted to make sure we had this very important artifact. The first letter went out to NASA after President Reagan announced the program, so you could say 25 years. Having a building had been one of the original criteria, but that didn't seem as important to them in the end as population and access to global markets. I can't argue that New York and Los Angeles aren't bigger than us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What was your response when NASA announced its decision?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A shuttle would have been our first choice. I won't pretend we're not disappointed, but we're moving forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are the plans for the Space Gallery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We will have a full-size mockup of the space shuttle -- a full fuselage shuttle trainer. It looks exactly like the shuttle except that it doesn't have wings. One advantage is that because it is not a priceless artifact like the shuttle, we'll be able to use it for educational purposes. Some people, but not everyone, will be able to go inside. They won't be able to do that with the shuttles. The trainer is about the size of a 747. The tail is 56 feet high. From the outside it will look exactly like the shuttle except for the wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You raised $9 million in public donations to build the Space Gallery. Were contributors upset once they heard the gallery wouldn't actually house a shuttle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Everyone was disappointed. We did our best. We did everything we could to get it. I don't feel like this is a consolation prize. I was very impressed with the way the community accepted this so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is the museum going to need to change its marketing strategy? Will the admission price you must have had penciled in stay the same?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We never got tremendously ramped up for it. We always knew there was a lot of competition, that it was always an ''if.'' I know I'm sounding Pollyanna-ish, but we won't just be attracting people to come to see the Space Shuttle, we'll be representing the entirety of the space program now.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TITUSVILLE, Fla. -- As it has many times before, sometime Friday afternoon the stretch of Route 1 in front of Chris Galorneau's restaurant will turn into a parking lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drivers will abandon their cars, and customers will pour out of the Village Inn, where Mr. Galorneau is the general manager, as they will at businesses up and down Route 1, which serves as a main street for this city of 45,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before 4 p.m., all eyes will turn toward the Kennedy Space Center, 12 miles east across the wide expanse of the Indian River Lagoon. There, at Launch Pad 39A, if the weather allows, the shuttle Endeavour will thunder into the sky on a pedestal of flame, carrying six astronauts on a two-week mission to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The place will clear out,'' Mr. Galorneau said Wednesday while waitresses bustled around him, and every diner got a free piece of pie for Pie Rush Wednesday. ''Everybody crowds down to the river. And then, as soon it goes up, 10 minutes later I have a packed restaurant and I have a waiting list for hours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brief but jaw-dropping spectacle that is a shuttle launching has occurred 133 times before, and Mr. Galorneau has seen his share (except for the time he was stuck inside making pancake batter -- ''You can't run a pancake house without pancake batter,'' he said -- and got to feel the building shake). This launching is expected to be one of the biggest ever, with perhaps three-quarters of a million people jamming Titusville, Cape Canaveral and other nearby towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the interest in the Endeavour mission is no doubt because of the drama involving its commander, Capt. Mark E. Kelly, whose wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, was gravely wounded in a shooting in January. She is here to watch the launching. And some of it is no doubt because of an anticipated visit by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the main draw is the fact that after this liftoff, and the launching of the Atlantis in two months, there will be no more space shuttle voyages. After three decades, the program has just about reached the end of the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're not going to see another one -- this is going to be it,'' said Truman Scarborough, who was Titusville's mayor in the 1980s and served as a Brevard County commissioner for 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scarborough and others said that for the past three or four launchings, the crowds have been getting larger as the program nears its end. Officials were forecasting perhaps a million or more for the Atlantis launch, a crowd that would rival the glory days of the space program, when a mammoth Saturn V rocket propelled the Apollo 11 astronauts toward the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the space center, the shuttle program's demise is apparent in the physical changes taking place. At Launch Pad 39B, a twin to the pad where the Endeavour sits, workers were dismantling, bit by bit, the giant steel structures that coddled many shuttles before liftoff -- including the Challenger, which rocketed off in 1986, never to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several miles away, at a huge bay where workers would normally be swarming over the shuttle Discovery to ready it for its next mission, they were instead preparing it to be shipped next year to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Titusville and other towns nearby, the changes are being measured in terms of humans, not hardware. While the shuttle program never really achieved its lofty goal of making spaceflight routine, it did provide a routine for thousands of aerospace workers here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of them -- mostly employees of contractors, not NASA -- have already received pink slips. Many more layoffs and buyouts are to come this summer -- in all, about 8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been our livelihood forever,'' said the Rev. Tom Porter, pastor of Temple Baptist Church here, who said some laid-off members of his congregation had already left for new jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titusville and other communities saw this coming; discussions about the end of the shuttle program began as early as seven years ago. And old-timers have seen this kind of thing before, especially when the Apollo moon program ended in 1973. ''In the early '70s, I used to come over here from St. Petersburg, and it was a ghost town,'' Pastor Porter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, it was the shuttle program that shook the area out of its post-Apollo doldrums. And while NASA plans eventually to replace the shuttles with commercial manned rockets that would use the space center, no one knows how soon that would happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials say that the region is much more diverse economically now and that the effect of the space industry, for better or worse, is not as great as it used to be. With its many shuttered businesses -- the Miracle City Mall, just down the block from Mr. Galorneau's restaurant, is a shell of its former self, with only a few stores open -- Titusville is not that different from other Florida cities, far from the Space Coast, which overbuilt in the boom years only to fall hard in the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the economic diversity, Mr. Scarborough said, there is something else that is different: life is more complicated. Apollo employed a lot of young engineers who quickly pulled up stakes when the program closed. These days the engineers and other workers are older, and many of their spouses work. Leaving for a new job may not be so easy; it may not even be desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Breaking and running, when you're within 10 or 15 years of retirement, doesn't seem to be making sense to them,'' Mr. Scarborough said. ''Which is not what happened after Apollo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pastor Porter said that this week his congregation prayed that President Obama, who has continued to nudge the manned spaceflight program away from NASA and toward private companies, ''would see the launch and be so moved to keep the program going.'' Did he think that would happen? ''No,'' he said. ''Humanly speaking, no way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pastor Porter said that some workers have already taken steps to be ready for layoffs. But others have not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Bible says consider the ants,'' he said. ''The ants -- you know, they toil, they save up, they prepare. Yeah, in a perfect world that would be great.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- An electrical problem forced NASA on Friday to postpone the launching of the shuttle Endeavour, giving President Obama and hundreds of thousands of spectators a lesson in the fickle nature of space technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than four hours before the scheduled 3:47 p.m. liftoff, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials announced that it would be delayed at least until Monday afternoon while technicians tried to fix the problem, which affects equipment that supplies hydraulic power to move the shuttle's engines and flaps during ascent and re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials suggested that the launching could be delayed further. ''We will not fly this machine until it is ready,'' said Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, ''and today it was not ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay frustrated huge crowds that had gathered outside the space center to watch the start of the next-to-last mission in the 30-year shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama, who had been scheduled to watch the launching with his wife, Michelle, and daughters, was touring tornado damage in Alabama when the postponement was announced. He decided to visit the space center anyway, arriving about two hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the launching control center, the president and his wife met for about 10 minutes with Gabrielle Giffords, the wounded Arizona Democratic congresswoman and wife of the mission commander, Capt. Mark E. Kelly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before going in to see Ms. Giffords, Mr. Obama greeted Captain Kelly in a corridor. The men shook hands and embraced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obamas also met with the five other members of the shuttle crew. With their daughters, they toured the building where the Atlantis spacecraft is being prepared for the 135th and final shuttle mission, in late June. They walked under the shuttle, getting a close look at its thermal tiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts are under quarantine rules before a launching and ordinarily their contact with others, even family members, is restricted, but NASA officials said flight doctors had cleared the Obamas to meet with the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giffords, who suffered a severe head wound in a shooting in January, had arrived on Wednesday to watch the launching. There was no immediate word as to whether she would stay in Florida or return to the Houston rehabilitation hospital where she has been recovering for the past two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts had undergone final medical checks and donned orange flight suits and were on their way to the launching pad in a van when the postponement was announced. The van made a U-turn and parked briefly at the control center before returning to the astronauts' quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever it begins, the mission, to the International Space Station, is scheduled to last two weeks. The Endeavour crew will install a $2 billion particle-physics experiment, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, at the space station, where it will search for evidence of the elusive ''dark matter'' that is thought to be ubiquitous in the universe. The shuttle will also deliver spare parts, and the crew will perform maintenance tasks outside the station in four spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Friday, preparations for the mission had been relatively smooth, with weather the major concern. But postponements due to equipment problems are not uncommon, and NASA officials had previously said they would not forgo safety procedures just because the president was going to be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach said the problem that forced the postponement was most likely an electrical short in an area of the shuttle that would take time to reach. Shortly after the decision was announced, technicians drained the spacecraft's huge external fuel tank, which had been filled with liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel early Friday. The fuels must be removed before it is safe to work on the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach and other officials said that depending on the extent of the problem, a Monday launching might be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has a launching window each afternoon through Wednesday; after that the Endeavour might have to wait until May 9 or 10 to try again.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DENNIS OVERBYE   </div><div>775 words</div><div>5 May 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a tour de force of technology and just plain stubbornness spanning half a century and costing more than $750 million, a team of experimenters from Stanford University reported on Wednesday that a set of orbiting gyroscopes had detected a slight sag and an even slighter twist in space-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finding confirms some of the weirdest of the many strange predictions -- like black holes and the expanding universe -- of Albert Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have completed this landmark experiment of testing Einstein's universe,'' Francis Everitt, leader of the project, known as Gravity Probe B, said at a news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington. ''And Einstein survives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was hardly a surprise. Observations of planets, the Moon and particularly the shifting orbits of the Lageos research satellites had convinced astronomers and physicists that Einstein's predictions were on the mark. Nevertheless, scientists said that the Gravity Probe results would live forever in textbooks as the most direct measurements, and that it was important to keep testing theories that were thought to be correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clifford M. Will of Washington University in St. Louis -- who was not part of the team but was chairman of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration advisory committee evaluating its work, and who wrote a book titled ''Was Einstein Right?'' -- said that in science, ''no such book is ever closed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein's theory relates gravity to the sagging of cosmic geometry under the influence of matter and energy, the way a sleeper makes a mattress sag. One consequence is that a massive spinning object like Earth should spin up the empty space around it, the way twirling the straw in a Frappuccino sets the drink and the whole Venti-size cup spinning around with it, an effect called frame dragging. Astronomers think this effect, although minuscule for Earth, could play a role in the black hole dynamos that power quasars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Empty space in the vicinity of Earth is indeed turning, Dr. Everitt reported at the news conference and in a paper prepared for the journal Physical Review Letters, at the leisurely rate of 37 one-thousandths of a second of arc -- the equivalent of a human hair seen from 10 miles away -- every year. With an uncertainty of 19 percent, that measurement was in agreement with Einstein's predictions of 39 milliarcseconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the ''sag'' should alter the space-time geometry around Earth, warping it from the Euclidean ideal and cutting an inch out of the Gravity Probe's orbit around it, so that the circumference is slightly less than the Euclidean ideal of pi times the orbit's diameter, a fact confirmed by the Stanford gyroscopes to an accuracy of 0.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Everitt, who joined the Gravity Probe experiment in 1962 as a young postdoctoral fellow and has worked on nothing else since, the announcement on Wednesday capped a career-long journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment was conceived in 1959, but the technology to make these esoteric measurements did not yet exist, which is why the experiment took so long and cost so much. The gyroscopes, for example, were made of superconducting niobium spheres, the roundest balls ever manufactured, which then had to be flown in a lead bag to isolate them from any other influences in the universe, save the subversive curvature of space-time itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before the probe's launching, Dr. Francis said the project had been canceled at least seven times, ''depending on what you mean by canceled.'' It was finally sent into orbit in 2004 and operated for some 17 months, but not all went well. When the scientists began analyzing their data, they discovered that patches of electrical charge on the niobium balls had generated extra torque on the gyroscopes, causing them to drift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take five more years to understand the spurious signals and retrieve the gravity data by dint of an effort that Dr. Will called ''nothing less than heroic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the NASA grant ran out. Dr. Everitt secured another one from Richard Fairbank, a financier and son of one of the experiment's founders, William Fairbank, that was matched by NASA and Stanford. When that ran out and NASA turned him down for a new grant, Dr. Everitt obtained a $2.7 million grant from Turki al-Saud, a Stanford graduate and vice president for research institutes at the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of current and former NASA astronauts gathered in Cocoa Beach, Fla., on Saturday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Alan Shepard's suborbital flight. The event was marked by a parade, with the astronauts riding in a fleet of Chevrolet Corvettes that included examples of the sports car's six design iterations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts rode in Corvettes that corresponded with the time period of their space missions. Scott Carpenter, who in 1962 became the second American to make an orbital flight, sat on the rear deck of a C1 Corvette convertible, while Susan Kilrain, a crew member from multiple missions in the space shuttle Columbia in the '90s, rode in a C5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corvettes, because of some healthy shoves from General Motors and an enterprising Chevrolet dealer in Florida, have been an integral part of astronaut lore for decades. However, Mr. Shepard seems to have initiated the relationship when he arrived for astronaut training in April 1959 in his 1957 Corvette. After Mr. Shepard completed the 1961 mission, Edward N. Cole, a G.M. executive, rewarded him with a specially prepared 1962 model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter the racecar driver Jim Rathmann, who opened a Chevrolet-Cadillac dealership near the Space Center in 1961. Seeing a publicity opportunity, Mr. Rathmann developed a special lease arrangement that put numerous astronauts behind the wheel of Corvettes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, when three Apollo 12 astronauts were photographed atop their identical Riverside Gold coupes for a Life magazine feature story, space-program directors reportedly fretted that the Corvette/NASA tie-up could be construed as a product endorsement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the relationship, celebrated in film and print, has endured, as it did in Cocoa Beach on Saturday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who hunt for life on other worlds, water in its liquid form is perhaps the leading indicator. Life as we know it on Earth is based on water and carbon. And if organisms can prosper here in nasty environments -- in geysers, in the depths of the sea, in toxic waste, in water that is too hot, too cold, too acidic or too alkaline -- why could they not prosper out there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists for years regarded liquid water as a solar system rarity, for there was no place apart from Earth that seemed to have the necessary physical attributes, except perhaps Jupiter's ice-covered moon, Europa, which probably concealed a subterranean ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past 20 years of space exploration, however, have caused what the astrobiologist David Grinspoon calls a sea change in thinking. It now appears that gravity, geology, radioactivity and antifreeze chemicals like salt and ammonia have given many ''hostile'' worlds the ability to muster the pressures and temperatures that allow liquid water to exist. And research on Earth has shown that if there is water, there could be life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mars and Venus, on Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan, and even on two outer-belt asteroids, researchers have shown that the presence of liquid water is possible and even likely. Proof of life, of course, will come only when something -- or someone -- puts a drop of alien water under a microscope and sees a microbe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Water and carbon-based life works well,'' Dr. Grinspoon said. ''That doesn't mean it's the only way, but it's the only way we know, and it gives us something to look for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding water in space, in the form of ice, has never been a problem. Hydrogen is the most common element in the solar system, and oxygen is not far behind. When the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, a spiraling disc of dust and gas spun out from the Sun to produce the planets, their moons, and an enormous cloud of comets, planetoids and other bits of cosmic flotsam. Nature endowed much of this debris with a generous helping of water ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liquid water is another matter. The heat of the Sun may melt the ice, but in the vacuum of space there is little or nothing on the surface of most solar system objects to keep the heated molecules together, so they flash instantly away as water vapor. This process is called sublimation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The physics of sublimation are unforgiving. Liquid water needs a delicate balance of temperature and pressure. Ice must be able to melt without boiling off, but the water must stay warm enough that it does not refreeze. On Earth, with a sea level atmospheric pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch, water is liquid between 32 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit. On the unshadowed parts of our Moon, where the atmospheric pressure is zero and daytime temperatures can exceed 260 degrees Fahrenheit, the surface ice is long gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ice survives at very low temperatures, however, and the chunks of debris that linger in the chill reaches of deep space beyond Neptune make up the biggest source of water in the solar system today. These dirty snowballs re-enter the planetary system periodically as comets. When they get close enough to the Sun, the ice begins to sublimate, giving the comets their characteristic tail of dust and water vapor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists say it is likely that much of the ice in the inner solar system came from comets. On Earth, cometary impacts early in the planet's history could have provided this raw material, and the Sun and atmospheric pressure would have done the rest. Earth is the only place in the solar system so far discovered where liquid is the default state of surface water. And Earth is where life proliferates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is maybe not the only place. Dr. Grinspoon has theorized that Venus, whose spectacular volcanism boiled off all its surface water long ago, nevertheless harbored liquid moisture in the noxious clouds of sulfuric acid that cloak the planet. In 2008 the European Space Agency's Venus Express orbiter measured water vapor in the clouds. About 30 miles above the surface in the Venusian mist, where temperatures are about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, extremophiles could find a comfort zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another improbable venue for liquid water is the outer limits of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. There, using infrared telescopes, two teams of astronomers working separately in 2008 and 2009 found water ice on the surface of the asteroid 24 Themis, about 280 million miles from the Sun. Last year, the teams joined forces and found ice on a second asteroid, 65 Cybele, which, with a diameter of 180 miles, was about 1.5 times as large as 24 Themis and 45 million miles farther out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For ice to endure on like objects with no atmosphere that close to the Sun, there must be a mechanism to replenish what is lost to sublimation. Humberto Campins, a University of Central Florida astrophysicist and leader of one of the discovery teams, suggested that the patchy ice was a thin coating of frost from a reservoir hidden below the asteroids' topsoil regolith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the asteroid faced the Sun, heat penetrated the topsoil, causing subsurface ice to sublimate and migrate as water vapor to the surface, where it froze at night only to sublimate again during the day. In a variation on this theme, Dr. Campins said, meteorites could be churning up the asteroid topsoil, thus bringing ice closer to the surface. This process is called ''impact gardening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We suspect that something like this is happening,'' Dr. Campins said, but acknowledged a third possibility: The asteroids could contain enough radioactive isotopes to melt ice deep below the surface, creating liquid water that seeps upward before vaporizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need sufficient pressure and temperature,'' he said. ''But conceptually it's possible.'' Pressure would come from the asteroids' interior gravity, allowing water to exist once the isotopes melt the ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radioactivity is a widespread phenomenon and a likely source of heat energy elsewhere in the solar system. Another heat source is friction, caused most commonly by tidal pressure or wobbling of an object on its axis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence that Jupiter's moon Europa harbors an enormous liquid ocean beneath its icy shell has arisen in part from observations suggesting that tidal forces create heat by stretching and compressing the moon as it rotates around Jupiter in an eccentric orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently scientists have been able to study tidal forces up close during fly-bys of Saturn's moon Enceladus by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. In 2005 Cassini found that Enceladus, with a diameter of only 300 miles, was spewing water ice grains from cracks in its south polar region. The grains were the ''dust'' that formed Saturn's E-ring, and scientists soon began to suspect strongly that the particles came from a subsurface liquid water source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't say it's virtually certain, but I'd give it 80 percent or 90 percent,'' said John Spencer, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>, a member of Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer team. ''Things may be a lot stranger than we imagine, but basically, I suspect we have an ocean.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More disputed is the theory that low-temperature ''cryo-volcanoes'' on Saturn's largest moon, the hydrocarbon-rich Titan, may be belching slushy lava composed of liquid water and ammonia, or some other low-temperature mixture, that freezes on the moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Titan has hydrocarbon sand dunes and methane lakes, and the cryo-volcanism could be hydrocarbon,'' said Jeffrey Kargel, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. ''We would have to go there to know for sure.'' Still, he added, ''there pretty much has to be water ice'' on Titan, since there is ice everywhere else in the solar system where it is cold enough. Titan has a regular orbit, so tidal friction would be minimal. For liquid water to exist, there would have to be a radioactive heat source and antifreeze compounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antifreeze is what Nilton Renno of the University of Michigan was looking for to explain the unforeseen event that befell NASA's Phoenix Lander on the arctic plains of Mars in 2008. Hydrazine thrusters that arrested the lander's descent had blown aside seven inches of Martian topsoil, exposing the expected layer of ice that lay below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four days later, something unexpected happened. Cameras examining the ice discerned a number of blisterlike globules on one of the spacecraft struts. A few days after that, the camera looked again. The globules remained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Dr. Renno, the atmospheric science team leader for Phoenix, did not immediately report it, he suspected he was observing droplets of liquid water. It would have to be salty enough not to vaporize in the Martian atmosphere or freeze at surface temperatures below minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that there needed to be antifreeze. Salt was the likeliest source: ''Suppose you have a swimming pool, and you fill it with saltwater,'' Dr. Renno said. ''When the pool cools down and starts to freeze, pure water becomes ice. The remaining water becomes more saline. It becomes harder to freeze as the salt concentration becomes stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence arrived in two steps. First, the lander's instruments found high salt concentrations in soil surrounding the spacecraft. Then, three weeks after touchdown, the Lander's robotic arm dug a trench in the ice and encountered a soft layer that contrasted with nearby hard ice patches that the lander penetrated with a drill. The slush was a second source of water, and like the first, ''probably filled with salt,'' Dr. Renno said. ''It was almost like ice cream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, ''we kept taking pictures'' of the strut, and 44 days after touchdown the largest droplet disappeared, Dr. Renno recalled. ''It grew too large, and dripped off.''</p>

Most of the photo books are usually done by professional photographers. And I really have no pretension of that. The notion of "curated" is really because, if you look in the book, it's not only pictures, there's also the content - a lot of text, poems from great writers, people bigger than I am. The notion of curated was to put together something that will touch people, not only the picture but also text that has very fundamental value to humanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet you've managed to get some extraordinary photographs and you've gone to great lengths to get them. How were these pictures physically taken?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had access there to a series of equipment - basically <span class="companylink">Nikon</span> D3, D3X with different types of lenses. And I did learn on Earth a little bit how those cameras work because I'm old fashioned - I'm an old dinosaur. I was still shooting with my old 35mm camera that I had for 30 years. This is new technology for me, and I'm not a technical guy at all. So while I was training, I got a couple of classes to understand how that electronic camera works. The first day [in space] was about how to take a picture. And then you realize that you're flying at 18,000 kilometers an hour and your subject goes under your eyes pretty fast. It's a constant amazing scenic vision. You basically have to use one eye on your left, seeing things coming. And then starting the motion of framing your subject, adjusting your lens, and once you're just at the right moment to frame it, you have to click. And once you click, you're done. That's it. It passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell me the difference about the photographs you took and what you could see with the naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know if you can remember - you probably have done this when you were a kid - when those clouds come up and you lay down on the grass and watch the clouds just get in motion. And then you start to envision, to see characters, animal shapes and stuff like that. I did that myself many times as a kid. Basically, when I was there, I lived the reverse. After the first days, after I kind of practiced shooting, it was exactly this feeling. There have been so many pictures done by astronauts and cosmonauts, which are more scientific or just traditional, cliche. And I want to try to make it distinctive with a little artistic twist in it. This is what I was looking for: animal shapes, characters, organic forms, geometrical things, and, of course, the beauty of the planet by itself. Volcanoes - there are some subjects you cannot pass through without taking them. I was seeing big cities, but those subjects were not really interesting me. I was looking for other things. Because those cities have been photographed many times before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're not tremendously magnified, these images?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All my lenses were between basically 200 to 800 millimeters, so I had a quite good zoom. But all the pictures are basically natural. But you take the photographs through the window, and, of course from the stratosphere, there was a kind of a milky thing to it. Which we cleaned up a bit. But basically the photos were pretty much just what I was seeing. What is in the book is exactly the frame I took, we didn't cut any frame or readjust anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you went up there you didn't know that you were going to be so compelled by taking pictures?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, the pictures I was foreseeing taking more as souvenirs. I've been traveling all my life, and always I take pictures every place I go. And it's more personal. And when I got back I started sharing it with friends and I was seeing their reaction. A couple of photographer friends, I showed them and they said, "Listen, you have something." One of the things that stunned people was my framing. I guess it comes from my profession - working at <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span>, I'm a perfectionist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which do you find more rewarding, the images that tend more toward abstraction because the scale isn't obvious, or the ones where you realize how big it is because there are buildings and bridges and things like that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My favorite ones have an organic feeling to them. And the characters ones. I really amused myself picking out animal shapes and character shapes. This was my little pleasure session. I knew that no other astronaut or cosmonaut was having that look at the Earth. When they take pictures up there, most are because they have targets to reach for scientific reasons. The only thing I regret is that I wasn't able to take two months there because there's really a limited time - nine days in the station -- that you cover the Earth. It theoretically takes a month and a half to cover all continents. But that doesn't consider the clouds. And earth is covered in clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think space tourism is a good thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a privilege to go there. There's a universe out there. And I wish to everybody to be able to live that experience - to be able to see this planet from another point of view. When I was up there, there was some very specific moment when I was looking at the Earth in perspective of the universe. And it's an amazing void down there. You see the stars as far as you look. It's dark pitch. They're discovering life out there - we're probably not the only planet to have life - but so far we haven't encountered any of that. And you look at Earth and you see it in the perspective of the universe and you see it's fragility, how it preserved life from that little thin membrane that surrounded. And you say, "Wow, it's so fragile." And then you start to look at Earth in perspective of the human race as species. And then you look at volcanoes - when you are up there you see volcano eruptions, and hurricanes, and you even see big waves. So you see it's power. And you see that this planet has been there for millions of years, and wiped out many species. And start to realize, wait a minute, we are the ones who are a fragile situation, not the planet. The planet will adapt to anything. Maybe we should start to use the heart and the brain that we've been given to organize ourselves. Because if we keep screwing up things we may be just passing by in the history of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interesting. So going into space made you appreciate the fragility of humankind more so than the Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was a believer before. A lot of people asked, did it change you? It didn't change me. These are the values that I always had, thanks to my parents and the people I met through my life, the people that inspire me. But yes, this is something that reaffirms those beliefs. This is why I wish that more people would be able to do it. Because you know I was the No. 5 [space tourist] to go in space. We're still at the exploration part of it. Those guys who are living out there, they're really the explorers of the modern time. And they're so far away from being able to go further into space for many reasons - cost reasons, physical reasons . Adaption of the human body in space is not yet mastered. As soon as you hit space, you feel your body is going through a period of mutation. There's no blood in your head, you have a hard time swallowing. We're not born to naturally be in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know in addition to <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span>, you've become a professional poker player, you've gone into space, now there's a book of photographs. What is going to be the next big project?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book is the result of my next commitment, which is my foundation, One Drop. I'm a humanist. I always believed, even with Cirque du Soliel, that this is my way to contribute to a better world. I believe I'm very privileged, but many people face the reality when they wake up in the morning of not having food or a glass of water. Life's been good to me, and I believe you have to feed the circle of life. All my royalties will go to the foundation. The book is being done to raise money, to do projects, to bring water to people who need it, and to save life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- With Gabrielle Giffords, the wounded Arizona congresswoman, watching from a wheelchair, the shuttle Endeavour lifted off Monday morning on a mission to pry secrets from the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 8:56 a.m. Eastern time, the spacecraft rose slowly on a pillar of fire, picking up speed and eventually disappearing from view as it stabbed through a layer of clouds on its way to orbit. Commanding the six-man crew was Capt. Mark E. Kelly, Ms. Giffords's husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congresswoman, who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in January, watched in private with relatives of other crew members and said, ''Good stuff, good stuff,'' as the shuttle rocketed away, according to her chief of staff, Pia Carusone. Captain Kelly's twin brother, Scott, who is also an astronaut, gave a bouquet of roses to Ms. Giffords, who was wearing her husband's wedding ring on a chain around her neck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, crowds that law enforcement officials had estimated could reach half a million people watched the liftoff, the next to last in the 30-year shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a fantastic launch,'' said Michael P. Moses, director of the mission's management team. ''A great day for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second try at a liftoff for the Endeavour, which was grounded by an electrical short circuit on April 29. NASA officials said that the shuttle's three main engines performed well during the 8 1/2-minute ascent and that the power system that had been the source of the electrical problem functioned perfectly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 minutes into the flight, the crew fired maneuvering engines to alter the shuttle's orbit so it could meet up with the International Space Station on Wednesday, more than 200 miles above the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once docked at the station, the astronauts will begin work on the 16-day mission's main objective: installing the $2 billion Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a giant magnet designed to sift through cosmic particles to find evidence of the elusive so-called dark matter that is thought to pervade the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the launching time approached, low clouds were the only concern, because NASA rules require good visibility should the shuttle have to make an emergency landing back at the space center. The clouds proved no problem, although they did obscure the view of spectators a little more than 20 seconds into the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had the clouds where we needed them, so we went,'' Mr. Moses said. ''We apologize that the view wasn't the best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two hours before the liftoff, NASA technicians had to make a quick repair on one of the shuttle's fragile ceramic tiles, which was found to be damaged when the crew hatch was closed. During the first few minutes of flight, a few small pieces of foam insulation were seen coming off the shuttle's huge external fuel tank, officials said, but a first analysis suggested that they did not cause any damage to the spacecraft. Damage from falling foam led to the destruction of the shuttle Columbia during re-entry in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, Ms. Giffords arrived at the launch control center -- where family members normally view launchings -- about 7 a.m., her chief of staff said. As the weather improved, ''she got very excited 'cause it looked like it was a go,'' Ms. Carusone said at a news conference. By Ms. Giffords's side were her mother, Gloria, and Captain Kelly's two daughters from an earlier marriage, Claire and Claudia. After the liftoff, there were celebratory hugs all around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several hours after the launching, Ms. Giffords left the space center for Houston, where she has been recovering at a rehabilitation hospital. Ms. Carusone said that it had not been decided whether the congresswoman would return for the landing, which is scheduled for June 1 about 2:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked at the news conference whether Ms. Giffords now understands what happened to her, Ms. Carusone replied, ''She's not aware of everything, but as she processes this, as anyone would, she's learned more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carusone said that the brevity of Ms. Giffords's ''good stuff'' comment reflected both the difficulty she had in regaining complete speech abilities and the situation. ''For all of us, there's not many words to describe watching the shuttle launch in person,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that there were no plans for Ms. Giffords to make a public appearance. ''We're far from that,'' she said. ''It's not a discussion we've had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the 25th and last flight of the Endeavour, which was built after the shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after a launching in 1986. The Endeavour, which first flew in 1992, will eventually be put on display at a science museum in Los Angeles. Only the flight of the shuttle Atlantis, scheduled for July, is left on NASA's calendar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Captain Kelly and the shuttle's pilot, Gregory H. Johnson, the Endeavour's passenger manifest consists of four mission specialists: Mike Fincke, Andrew J. Feustel, Gregory Errol Chamitoff and Roberto Vittori, a colonel in the Italian Air Force. The astronauts will conduct four spacewalks, performing maintenance tasks at the station and delivering a crate of spare parts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the galaxy full of orphans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that space was littered with hundreds of billions of planets that had been ejected from the planetary systems that gave them birth and either were going their own lonely ways or were only distantly bound to stars at least 10 times as far away as the Sun is from the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two Jupiter-mass planets floating around for each of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, according to measurements and calculations by an international group of astronomers led by Takahiro Sumi, of Osaka University in Japan, and reported in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bit of a surprise,'' said David Bennett, a Notre Dame astronomer who was part of the team. Before this research, it was thought that only about 10 or 20 percent of stars harbored Jupiter-mass planets. Now it seems as if the planets outnumber the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The implications of this discovery are profound,'' wrote Joachim Wambsganss, of Heidelberg University in Germany, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution in Washington said, ''It means there are a lot more gas giants out there than previous estimates.'' This, he added, has important consequences for theories of how such planets form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary astronomers say the results will allow them to tap into a whole new unsuspected realm of exoplanets -- as planets outside our own solar system are called -- causing scientists to re-evaluate how many there are, where they are and how they are created, even as astronomers immediately begin to ponder whether the new planets in question are in fact floating free or are just far from their stars, at distances comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune in our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Either there is a large population of Jupiter-mass planets far from their star, or, yes, there are a lot of lonely planets out there,'' said Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two decades, astronomers have identified some 500 planets that are circling other stars, and this year scientists using NASA's Kepler satellite announced 1,235 more candidates. But these were found using methods that favored the detection of planets close to their stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new work was done using a method known as gravitational microlensing, which is more sensitive to planets farther out. It relies on the ability of the gravitational field of a massive object -- in this case a planet and its star -- to bend light and act as a magnifying lens, as predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers from two groups -- Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics, based in New Zealand and Japan, and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, based in Poland and Chile -- monitor the light from a vast field of background stars, looking for brief blips of increased brightness caused by a planet and its host star passing in the foreground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group recorded 10 such events consistent with being caused by planet-size objects but did not detect the corresponding blips from these planets' host stars, suggesting either that they did not belong to any star, having been ejected by gravitational pinball games earlier in their lives, or that they were very distant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bennett said the results were consistent with these new planets' being about the same mass as Jupiter. In that case, he said, the prospects for life on them would be dim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In principle, microlensing could detect planets as small as Earth. Indeed, a microlensing experiment to look for planets was to be part of a new NASA spacecraft known as Wfirst, which was given the highest priority by a prestigious National Academy of Sciences panel last summer. Now, however, it will not fly until the 2020s, if it flies at all, because NASA will not have any money for it until the troubled James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble's successor, is finally launched, perhaps in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why call these things planets rather than small failed stars, like the slightly more massive brown dwarfs? Dr. Bennett said there are simply too many of them, even when nature's propensity to make more and more smaller objects is taken into account. ''We suspect they formed like planets,'' he said, explaining that they were once part of primordial protoplanetary disks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More and better observations should eventually establish whether they are true orphans or just on a long leash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss pointed out that most planetary systems would not have the gravitational oomph to eject so many massive objects. When push comes to shove, moreover, it is always the smaller object that gets sent out into space. There is no way, for example, that our own solar system could have kicked out any of those putative free-floaters, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More likely,'' Dr. Boss wrote in an e-mail, ''these are distant gas giants, much like our own Jupiter and Saturn. That makes our solar system's outer reaches look a little more commonplace.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The astronauts aboard the space shuttleEndeavour attached a $2 billion cosmic ray detector to the International Space Station on Thursday, and delighted scientists immediately began detecting ''thousands and thousands'' of subatomic particles from deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a powerful magnet and an intricate array of sensors, computer processors and high-speed data links, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is designed to measure tiny deflections in the trajectories of cosmic ray particles to look for the telltale signs of antimatter and the unseen dark matter believed to make up nearly 25 percent of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also will be on the lookout for the unexpected as it sifts through torrents of passing protons, electrons and atomic nuclei for the next 10 years or longer, ideally for the remaining life of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We immediately checked all the detectors; everything functioned properly,'' Samuel Chao Chung Ting, the project's principal investigator, told reporters. ''Not a single one was broken, not a single electronic channel was malfunctioning. Right away, we began to see an enormous amount of data coming down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holding up sample graphs showing the passages of an electron and a carbon nucleus, Dr. Ting said, ''We're very pleased. It took us 17 years to build this thing.'' Over time, he said, the scientists on the project hope ''to make an important contribution to our understanding of the origin of the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carried aloft in Endeavour's cargo bay, the 7 1/2-ton Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer was attached to the right side of the space station's solar power truss using the orbiter's robot arm and a similar crane on the lab complex. After the instrument was locked in place, an umbilical carrying power and data was attached by remote control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within two to three hours, scientists and engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston were receiving a steady stream of data. ''We have thousands and thousands of signatures already,'' Dr. Ting said, referring to particle signatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a welcome, long-awaited milestone for a project with a history that reads like ''The Perils of Pauline.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2003 explosion of the space shuttle Columbia, the project was bumped from NASA's manifest. A lobbying campaign by Dr. Ting and his colleagues eventually won over President Obama and key lawmakers, who approved financing for an extra shuttle flight to get the particle-detecting magnet into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a decision to extend the space station's life from 2015 to 2020 and beyond prompted Dr. Ting's team to give up a more powerful but short-lived superconducting magnet in favor of a less powerful version, used in a 1998 test flight, that could last the life of the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Dr. Ting and his team -- more than 600 physicists from 60 institutions in 16 countries -- have spent nearly two decades designing, building, testing and redesigning the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The payoff is finally at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the mysteries the device was designed to explore is what happened to the antimatter that must have been created when the universe was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the universe comes from a big bang, before the big bang it is vacuum,'' Dr. Ting said before Endeavour's launching. ''Nothing exists in vacuum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, he said, ''You have matter, you must have antimatter; otherwise we would not have come from the vacuum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So now the universe is 14 billion years old, you have all of us, made out of matter. The question is, where is the universe made out of antimatter?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another subject of study for the spectrometer is dark matter, the mysterious material believed to provide the gravitational glue that holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together. While Dr. Ting's creation cannot directly detect dark matter, it possibly can detect the particles that would be produced in dark matter collisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To my collaborators and I, the most exciting objective of A.M.S. is to probe the unknown,'' Dr. Ting said, ''to search for phenomena which exist in nature, but yet we have not the tools or the imagination to find.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, as NASA continued its advances in space, on Earth -- in Washington -- it was scolded for tardiness in deciding what it will do after the shuttles are retired in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation sent a letter to Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, demanding documents detailing how the agency was carrying out the blueprint Congress passed last year for future space exploration. The plans called for development of a new heavy-lift rocket and spacecraft for missions beyond low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The senators said NASA had failed to provide required reports to Congress and requested that a NASA official begin briefing them every other week about the agency's efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA's current inaction and indecision in implementing this transition could impact our global standing and take many years and billions of dollars to repair,'' said the letter, signed by Senators John D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat of West Virginia who is chairman of the committee; Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the ranking Republican member; Bill Nelson, a Democrat of Florida and chairman of the space subcommittee; and John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has placed higher priority on financing commercial companies for developing space taxis for taking NASA astronauts to orbit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNT HOPKINS, Ariz. -- There is no Border Patrol in space. But the very earthly cat-and-mouse game between smugglers and America's border agents is affecting the exploration of space, lighting up the nighttime sky in southern Arizona and making astronomers strain even harder to figure out the mysteries of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona is an astronomy haven with an array of prestigious observatories taking advantage of the state's dry weather, minimal cloud cover and dark skies. But the state's astronomers worry about a variety of threats -- border enforcement among them -- to the pristine conditions that have allowed them to discover new planets, gain important insights into how the universe functions and generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually in economic return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drug smugglers and illegal immigrants making their way north are sometimes visible to astronomers at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory here who take a break from gazing skyward to look around the rough, wooded terrain. But it is not the outlaws that affect their work as much as the authorities who are after them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Border Patrol helicopter shining a blinding beam on a group of suspects runs the risk of interfering with valuable machinery trained upward, like the four massive telescopes, known as Veritas or the Very Energetic Radiation Telescope Array System, that measure gamma rays. ''It's happened,'' said Dan Brocious, spokesman for the observatory, which is jointly run by the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard University and has operated atop this mountaintop since 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Border Patrol says that it tries to steer its helicopters clear of observatories, but that frequent staff turnover has occasionally resulted in missteps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The checkpoints that the Border Patrol has set up around southern Arizona, complete with high-powered beams to light them up at night, have been another sore point, prompting meetings between area astronomers and agents and a pledge from the Border Patrol to reduce the wattage. The lights are among the brightest points now visible at night in the area, astronomers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even car headlights can be a problem for sensitive stargazing, which is why signs along the winding road that leads to the observatory urge drivers to use only their parking lights after dark. The nearly 50 years since the Whipple Observatory was built here in the Coronado National Forest have brought retirement communities, shopping malls and assorted other developments to the area, all of which have boosted the light levels detected by astronomers scrutinizing the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wildfires are another concern in the remote areas where the observatories are located. In 2005, a fire that was caused by a lightning strike came within less than a mile of the Whipple Observatory, which had to be evacuated until firefighters, aided by a sudden rainstorm, were able to control it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, a fire west of Nogales prompted a brief closing of the MMT Observatory, which is also atop Mount Hopkins. The observatory's large telescope, 21 feet in diameter, is the 14th largest in the world and is sought after by researchers looking into deep space. Besides less-than-optimal viewing conditions caused by the fire, operators were worried about the buildup of ash on the mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well after the sun has set, from 8,500 feet up on Mount Hopkins, the second-highest peak in the Santa Rita Range, one can observe both the majestic nature of the universe and the threats to the stargazing that has long gone on here. Competing with moonlight are street lights, traffic lights, security lights and innumerable other forms of illumination. To the north is the Tucson skyline, a vast expanse of soft white and yellow light, which has been managed by municipal dark-sky restrictions and has not grown in intensity anywhere near as fast as the population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are a powerful lobby here when it comes to keeping the skies dark at night, and nearby Tucson is the headquarters for the International Dark-Sky Association, which attempts to press for light restrictions around the world. ''Light pollution is an issue all over the world,'' said Paul J. Groot, an astronomer from the Netherlands who was conducting research on the source of X-rays from other galaxies at the MMT Observatory this week. ''It limits our deep observation of the night sky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An open-pit copper mine that is proposed for an area southeast of Tucson and would operate around the clock has alarmed dark-sky advocates, even though the Rosemont Copper Company has said it plans to abide by Pima County's restrictions on light pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When these observatories were selected, there was hardly anyone living here,'' Mr. Brocious said atop the mountain as darkness and light seemed to compete in all directions. ''Tucson was a sleepy little cow town back then. There's nothing sleepy about it now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the spring of 1961. President John F. Kennedy, speaking of new frontiers and projecting the vigor of youth, had been in office barely four months, and April had been the cruelest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 12th, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth -- one more space triumph for the Soviet Union. Though the flight was not unexpected, it was nonetheless deflating; it would be more than a month before Alan Shepard became the first American in space, and that was on a 15-minute suborbital flight. On the 17th, a force of anti-Castro exiles, trained by the C.I.A., invaded communist Cuba at the Bay of Pigs -- a fiasco within 36 hours. Mr. Kennedy's close aide Theodore Sorensen described him on the 19th as ''anguished and fatigued'' and ''in the most emotional, self-critical state I had ever seen him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one meeting, his brother Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general, ''turned on everybody,'' it was reported, saying: ''All you bright fellows. You got the president into this. We've got to do something to show the Russians we are not paper tigers.'' At another, the president pleaded: ''If somebody can, just tell me how to catch up. Let's find somebody -- anybody. I don't care if it's the janitor over there.'' Heading back to the Oval Office, he told Mr. Sorensen, ''There's nothing more important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, 50 years ago, on May 25, 1961, President Kennedy addressed a joint session of Congress and a national television audience, declaring: ''I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There it was, the challenge flung before an adversary and to a nation on edge in an unconventional war, the beginning of Project Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Echoes of this time lift off the pages of ''John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon'' (Palgrave Macmillan), a new book by John M. Logsdon, a political scientist and longtime space policy specialist at George Washington University. He has drawn on new research in archives, oral histories and memoirs available in recent years to shed new light on the moon race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The famous speech came after five weeks of hand wringing, back-channel memos and closed-door conferences, often overseen by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. In those meetings NASA and Pentagon officials, scientists and engineers, budget analysts and others decided that sending astronauts to the Moon by the end of the sixties was the country's best shot at overcoming the Soviet post-Sputnik command of the orbital front in the cold war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Dr. Logsdon said in an interview last week, the new material highlighted some recurring themes that had been overlooked, like Mr. Kennedy's return, time and again, to the idea of engaging the Russians in a cooperative venture, his continuing support of the project through a time of doubt, and how little was known then of Soviet capabilities and intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, Dr. Logsdon said, hindsight had made him aware of his blindness to Apollo's implications for the long run. He said he had been wrong, in a 1970 book on the subject, to think that the lunar decision ''can be generalized to tell us how to proceed toward other ''great new American enterprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like many others who for years lived and breathed the project, he finally had to recognize that the ''impact of Apollo on the space program has on balance been negative.'' It was, he explained, not the beginning of human voyages to Mars and lunar bases but ''a dead-end undertaking in terms of human travel beyond the immediate vicinity of this planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it takes two to have a race. The American president could not be sure the Russians had a lunar-landing program. There was no evidence that the Russians were building facilities for a booster capable of launching people to the Moon. Was the president just double-dog-daring them to come out in the schoolyard and show their stuff?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An intelligence report in 1962 had nothing to add, short of speculating that ''the chances are better than even that a lunar landing is a Soviet objective.'' Only in 1964 did intelligence agents detect signs that there was indeed someone to make it a race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, NASA set its sights on late 1967 for the landing attempt. As spending escalated, Apollo ran into its first sharp criticism in Congress, the science establishment and the news media in 1963. ''Even some of the Kennedy advisers were eager to slip the end-of-decade date and relieve the pressure, mainly to save money,'' Dr. Logsdon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ''winds of change,'' as he put it, may have motivated Kennedy's renewed invitation in a United Nations address in September to the Russians to join in a cooperative mission. He had proposed this informally to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, at a meeting in Vienna shortly after his 1961 address to Congress. It was rejected out of hand. Russian accounts after the cold war have linked the rejection to a fear of exposing the technological shortcomings of the country's program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter A. McDougall, the historian who wrote ''The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age,'' has suggested that Kennedy's periodic messages on space cooperation ''were just exercises in image-building.'' Dr. McDougall took a more skeptical view of spaceflight's bearing on geopolitics, more in line with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address on the spreading influence of the military-industrial complex in national affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon countered that the American achievements had by 1963 progressed to the point, as Mr. Sorensen said, that there was ''a very real chance that we were even with the Soviets.'' And since the Cuban missile crisis the year before, it was noted, Soviet-American relations had improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser, talked tactics with the president. Either press for cooperation with the Russians, he suggested, or continue to use their space effort as ''a spur to our own.'' In a memorandum, Mr. Bundy said that ''if we cooperate, the pressure comes off'' regarding the decade goal, and ''we can easily argue that it was our crash effort in '61 and '62 which made the Soviets ready to cooperate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year of criticism, Kennedy wavered but never backed away from his lunar commitment. Visiting Cape Canaveral on Nov. 16, 1963, he seemed to enjoy seeing preparations for the next astronaut flights. Days later, on Nov. 22, in the speech Kennedy never lived to give in Dallas, he intended to say ''the United States of America has no intention of finishing second in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal was reached on July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong and then Buzz Aldrin stepped on the gray surface of the Sea of Tranquillity. Since the last of six landings, in 1972, no one has been back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No presidents since have felt the need or believed they could marshal political support for comparable undertakings. NASA has achieved dazzling successes exploring the solar system and the cosmos with robotic craft. But the agency was driven at the outset by the challenge of human flight to the Moon. At the conclusion of Apollo, Dr. Logsdon wrote, ''NASA entered a four-decade identity crisis from which it has yet to emerge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the book and interview, Dr. Logsdon sought solace in thinking that flying to the Moon at least ''will forever be a milestone in human experience, and particularly in the history of human exploration, perhaps eventual expansion.'' Even critics like Dr. McDougall conceded that ''perhaps Apollo could not be justified, but by God, we could not not do it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not raining on the Moon, but it does seem to be getting wetter and wetter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the prevailing view of the Moon was that it was dry. Then, two years ago, a NASA probe crashed into a deep crater near the Moon's south pole and confirmed large amounts of water ice within the shadows. Meanwhile, measurements by an orbiting Indian spacecraft suggested that a veneer of water, generated by the bombardment of solar wind particles, covered much of the Moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, scientists analyzing tiny fragments of hardened lava from long-ago lunar eruptions report that the fragments contain about as much water as similar magmas on Earth, meaning there is plenty of water inside the Moon too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have to admit, we were a little surprised,'' said Erik H. Hauri, a staff scientist in geochemistry at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and lead author of a paper published Thursday in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hauri's surprise comes despite the fact that he and several of his co-authors predicted three years ago that they would find that much water. Back then, they looked at tiny beads of volcanic glass -- the beads were about the size of periods in printed text -- in soil brought back by Apollo astronauts. The beads contained water, but not a lot a lot of it: a maximum of 46 parts per million -- or 0.0046 percent water. Their models suggested that 95 percent of the water originally in the hot magma escaped as it cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hauri acknowledged that the extrapolation was less than ironclad. ''That's sticking your neck out pretty far,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new work started when another member of the research team, Alberto E. Saal, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University, handed a vial of Moon dirt to Thomas Weinreich, a Brown freshman, and asked him to sift through it for interesting particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Weinreich laboriously examined the soil, grain by grain, under a microscope, he found, mixed among the glass beads, some clear crystals; some of those crystals contained a tiny amount of glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crystals, made of the mineral olivine, prevented any of the water in the enclosed glass from escaping. The amount of water in the trapped glass was 20 to 100 times what had been previously measured in the glass beads, comparable to the water content of some Earth magmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a reservoir down there in the Moon that has the same concentration of water as some reservoirs in the upper mantle of Earth,'' Dr. Saal said. ''That's for sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is much less certain is how large the underground water-rich reservoir might be. Last year, researchers led by Zachary D. Sharp of the University of New Mexico came to the exact opposite conclusion. Based on concentrations of chlorine isotopes in lunar rocks, they concluded that the rocks must have hardened out of lava that contained almost no water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the interior of the Moon turns out to contain considerable water, then the ice at the bottom of lunar craters may have come from volcanic eruptions rather than comet impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finding would also throw a new wrinkle into explanations of how the Moon formed in the aftermath of a collision between the Earth and a Mars-size interloper about 4.6 billion years ago. The cataclysm would have created a ring of debris at an intensely hot temperature -- in the thousands of degrees. And the expectation of many scientists is that any water would have escaped into space before the debris coalesced into a dry moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's frankly a confusing picture,'' said David J. Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology. The giant impact theory provides a satisfying explanation for the orbit, size and basic physical characteristics of the Moon. But scientists have not been able to fully explain what makes up the Moon, and the water finding potentially adds another mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you will find among geochemists, cosmic chemists, there's still some doubt there,'' Dr. Stevenson said. ''They say, 'That's a wonderful story, but how does it fit my data?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IRVINE, Calif. -- Scientists have been using small variations in the Earth's gravity to identify trouble spots around the globe where people are making unsustainable demands on groundwater, one of the planet's main sources of fresh water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found problems in places as disparate as North Africa, northern India, northeastern China and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley in California, heartland of that state's $30 billion agricultural industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay S. Famiglietti, director of the University of California's Center for Hydrologic Modeling here, said the center's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as Grace, relies on the interplay of two nine-year-old twin satellites that monitor each other while orbiting the Earth, thereby producing some of the most precise data ever on the planet's gravitational variations. The results are redefining the field of hydrology, which itself has grown more critical as climate change and population growth draw down the world's fresh water supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace sees ''all of the change in ice, all of the change in snow and water storage, all of the surface water, all of the soil moisture, all of the groundwater,'' Dr. Famiglietti explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even as the data signal looming shortages, policy makers have been relatively wary of embracing the findings. California water managers, for example, have been somewhat skeptical of a recent finding by Dr. Famiglietti that from October 2003 to March 2010, aquifers under the state's Central Valley were drawn down by 25 million acre-feet -- almost enough to fill Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Zlotnick, a board member of the Association of California Water Agencies, said that the managers feared that the data could be marshaled to someone else's advantage in California's tug of war over scarce water supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of paranoia about policy wonks saying, 'We've got to regulate the heck out of you,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other sensitivities in arid regions around the world where groundwater basins are often shared by unfriendly neighbors -- India and Pakistan, Tunisia and Libya or Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories -- that are prone to suspecting one another of excessive use of this shared resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water politics was hardly on Dr. Famiglietti's mind when he first heard about Grace. In 1992, applying for a job at the University of Texas, he was interviewed by Clark R. Wilson, a geophysicist there who described a planned experiment to measure variations in Earth's gravitational field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I walked into his office and he pulled out a piece of paper saying: I'm trying to figure out how distribution of water makes the Earth wobble,'' said Dr. Famiglietti. ''This was 1992. I was blown away. I instantly fell in love with the guy. I said, 'This is unbelievable, this is amazing, it opens up this whole area.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then the Grace experiment was still waiting in a queue of NASA projects. But he and Matt Rodell, a Ph.D. candidate under his supervision, threw themselves into investigating whether Grace would work, a so-called ''proof of concept'' exercise which turned out to show that Grace data were reliable and could support groundwater studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a wide-open field we came into,'' said Dr. Rodell, now a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ''We were like kids in a candy store. There was so much to be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Grace was conceived by a group of scientists led by Byron D. Tapley, the director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas, it was the darling of geodesists, who study variations in the Earth's size, shape and rotational axis. Climate scientists also were keenly interested in using it to study melting of ice sheets, but hydrologists paid scant attention at first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Dr. Wilson recalled, ''Jay jumped on the problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years later, the two satellites were launched from the Russian space facility at Plesetsk on the back of a used intercontinental ballistic missile in a collaboration between NASA and the German Aerospace Center and began streaming the gravity data back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acquiring the data for general research purposes would have been impossible before the end of the cold war because maps indicating the normal wiggles in Earth's gravitational field were used for targeting long-range missiles and were therefore classified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, groundwater measurements in the United States had been made from points on the Earth's surface -- by taking real-time soundings at 1,383 of the United States Geological Survey's observation wells and daily readings at 5,908 others. Those readings are supplemented by measuring water levels in hundreds of thousands of other wells, trenches and excavations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two satellites, each the size of a small car, travel in polar orbits about 135 miles apart. Each bombards the other with microwaves calibrating the distance between them down to intervals of less than the width of a human hair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mass below the path of the leading satellite increases -- because, say, the lower Mississippi basin is waterlogged -- that satellite speeds up, and the distance between the two grows. Then the mass tugs on both, and the distance shortens. It increases again as the forward satellite moves out of range while the trailing satellite is held back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measurements of the distance between the craft translate to a measurement of surface mass in any given region. The data is beautifully simple, Dr. Famiglietti said. From one moment to the next, ''it gives you just one number,'' he said. ''It's like getting on a scale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separating groundwater from other kinds of moisture affecting gravity requires a little calculation and the inclusion of information on precipitation and surface runoff obtained from surface studies or computer models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace data, like the information in a corresponding visual image, has its limits. Gravitational data gets sparser as the area examined gets smaller, and in areas smaller than 75,000 square miles it gets more difficult to reach conclusions about groundwater supplies. Most aquifers are far smaller than that -- California's 22,000-square-mile Central Valley overlies several different groundwater basins, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Famiglietti was able to calculate the overall drawdown of groundwater and to indicate that the problem was most severe in the southern region around the city of Tulare, for example, but the data was far too sparse to make statements about, say, the Kings River Water Conservation District, which measures about 1,875 square miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace ''gives a large picture,'' said Felix Landerer, a hydrologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, whereas a water manager has a couple of wells to monitor in a given district. ''It's difficult and not intuitive and not straightforward to bring these things together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas of the world, like northern India, the novelty of the gravitational measurements -- and perhaps the story they tell -- has led to pushback, scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is odd, if you're a hydrologist, especially a traditional hydrologist, to imagine a satellite up in the air that determines groundwater'' supply levels, said John Wahr, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Dr. Famiglietti and Dr. Rodell, Dr. Wahr and his colleague Sean Swenson faced opposition for a study on aquifer depletion in northern India. As Dr. Swenson explained, ''When in a place like India you say, 'We're doing something that is unsustainable and needs to change,' well, people resist change. Change is expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Dr. Famiglietti says he wants no part of water politics, he acknowledged that this might be hard to avoid, given that his role is to make sure the best data about groundwater is available, harvesting and disseminating all of the information he can about the Earth's water supply as aquifers dry up and shortages loom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look, water has been a resource that has been plentiful,'' he said. ''But now we've got climate change, we've got population growth, we've got widespread groundwater contamination, we've got satellites showing us we are depleting some of this stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we've taken it for granted, and we are probably not able to do that any more.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- NASA, it seems, is having trouble letting go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the agency gets its space shuttles ready to be shipped out to museums, it will not be sending them off lock, stock and barrel. The crews doing the prep work have been flooded with requests to squirrel away parts of the spacecraft for analysis. Valves, flight-control instruments, even the tires and windows -- little is safe from the clutches of NASA engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got a list of hundreds of items that have to come off the ship,'' said Stephanie S. Stilson, who is directing the preparation of the shuttle Discovery for delivery to the Smithsonian Institution next year in what NASA calls its ''transition and retirement'' program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, NASA named the permanent old-age homes for its shuttles, which have been escorting astronauts to space for 30 years. The Endeavour, which completed its last mission early Wednesday with a pinpoint landing after 16 days in orbit, will bask in glory only briefly before it is groomed for delivery to the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The Atlantis, which will make its final flight next month, is destined to live at the visitors' center here at the space center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery made its last flight in March and now sits in a maintenance bay, enclosed by platforms that would normally be crawling with workers inspecting and maintaining its many systems -- including the thousands of thermal tiles that cover its skin -- to be ready for its next liftoff. These days, as the shuttle program winds down and the staff has been winnowed by layoffs, technicians work on the Discovery only when there are no more pressing tasks. And rather than sprucing it up for another trip to space, likely as not they are taking something out of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We in engineering, we want to hold on to things that we could potentially use, or we want to study them, which is a smart thing to do,'' Ms. Stilson said. The shuttles are the only spacecraft that have been launched into orbit multiple times -- the Discovery is the most-traveled, with 39 missions -- and a better understanding of how the materials and equipment have fared could help future aerospace designers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stilson spoke near one of the Discovery's main landing gears, where the tires used on the last flight had been removed in favor of what NASA calls ''roll-around tires'' -- basically a bunch of old spares. On a higher platform, workers were putting the finishing touches on replacement windows for the spacecraft, the originals having been taken out so engineers could study what effect the microdebris encountered in so many trips in space had on the glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those who are to receive the shuttles say they understand the need for research, they are a little surprised by how much will be missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're considered to be the nation's official repository of our past,'' said Valerie Neal, curator for contemporary human spaceflight at the Smithsonian, which will display the Discovery at the National Air and Space Museum's annex near Dulles Airport. ''Our point of view would be to receive an orbiter in as intact a state as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neal said that when she first started discussing the fate of the shuttle with NASA several years ago, ''I rather naively thought it would be intact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the removal work is dictated by safety concerns. There are small explosive charges all around the shuttle, including one designed to blow a latch and deploy the front landing gear should the normal systems fail. Although the firing mechanism has been disabled, ''We don't want to take a chance that if it's sitting in the Smithsonian it could somehow detonate,'' Ms. Stilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thrusters near the shuttle's nose and the podlike maneuvering engines in the rear both contain propellants that are highly toxic and corrosive, even in tiny amounts. So these components have been removed and sent to a special facility where workers in hazardous materials suits will ''cut and gut'' them, removing much of the insides before shipping them back. ''We'll reinstall them, and from the outside they'll look exactly the same,'' Ms. Stilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's three main engines have been removed, in part because NASA has hopes they might be used again. In their place crews will install spare nozzles, the bell-shaped parts that the public sees protruding from the back of the spacecraft. But all the exquisitely machined pumps and plumbing that once handled thousands of gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen will essentially be replaced by an empty box. NASA, with its penchant for abbreviations, even has one for these: R.S.M.E.'s, for replica shuttle main engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Quinn, a technician who works for a NASA contractor and has cared for shuttles for 23 years, said it was ''a little bittersweet'' taking out the engines for the last time, which took about two weeks. But he is still proud that the Discovery will be on display. ''Basically, it will be in flight configuration as far as we're concerned, except that it will be a simulated engine,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not that NASA engineers are hovering over the shuttles like mechanics at a junkyard, trying to abscond with whatever they can get their hands on. The agency has a formal vetting process for part requests, and the proposals have to include bona fide research projects. ''I think that they're trying to install some checks and balances so the vehicles don't get totally cannibalized,'' Ms. Neal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey N. Rudolph, president of the California Science Center, said his organization also had some concerns, but would ''try to turn it into a positive.'' For example, he said, if NASA wants to reuse the main engines, ''that's a story we can tell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neal, who said she had ''come to peace'' that the toxic elements had to be removed but was ''heartbroken'' to learn that the main engines were going as well, said the Smithsonian had asked NASA to document everything it was taking out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I appreciate the engineering needs,'' she said, adding that there was a ''perfectly reasonable rationale'' for removing many parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she noted that in the past NASA engineers had come to the Smithsonian to get inside the Apollo command module displayed there, to get a firsthand feel for the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm thinking ahead 25, 50, 100 years,'' she said. ''I'm convinced there will be a need to get back inside the shuttle. People are going to want to know -- how did they do it? That's why we need to keep it as intact as possible.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, "CBS Sunday Morning" aired my story about the end of the Space Shuttle program. It was a story dear to my heart, one I'd hoped to do for years. It took me three trips to Kennedy Space Center to finally film the liftoff (because the final liftoff of the shuttle Endeavour kept being delayed).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm especially proud of the final shot, which I timed a dozen times so that my lines would end simultaneously with the actual liftoff behind me. Mother Luck was with me that day, as you can see from the finished story here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, we could include only snippets of the interviews we conducted. But as always, in "From the Desk of David Pogue," I have more space to share with you edited transcripts of those interviews. Here's one I really loved: a chat with William Gerstenmaier, who's the head of NASA's Shuttle and Space Station programs. He's been with the Shuttle program since 1977, when he was an engineer performing wind-tunnel tests on Shuttle models. I found him wise, modest and articulate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">----</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: I come here on behalf of 300 million Americans who want to know, in layman's terms, why the space shuttle is being retired? 'Cause everybody loves it!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: Yeah-- boy, it's tough. But the mission that the shuttle was designed for is kind of going away. If you look at the space station, this large spacecraft we built from parts from around the world it weighs 900,000 pounds in orbit. I mean, it's as big as a football field. It's huge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That international space station could never have been built without a space shuttle. The shuttle has this large cargo bay that can carry large pieces up. And that was the uniqueness of the shuttle. It could carry these big pieces to space. It has an air lock, so the crews can put on spacesuits, and go outside and do work. It has a robotic arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's not just a spacecraft, it's essentially a work platform, with a work crew, that can go build these huge things in space.Now, we see the exploration mission where we now want to go beyond lower-earth orbit. We want to go out and look at the moon. We want to go to near-earth asteroids. Maybe go back to Mars, or go back to a moon of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need a different type of spacecraft to do that. We don't need the large-winged body. We need more of a smaller capsule that can take that heat, of coming back from those larger destinations with a higher re-entry velocity. We don't need the big expansive cargo bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the new missions we're envisioning for the agency, and for the country, demand a different type of craft than what we have with the shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: They were gonna retire the Hubble Telescope, and the public had this huge outcry, "No! We love the Hubble." And then didn't they manage to extend it? Is there no chance that a public outcry to save the shuttle will-- will do any good?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: Well, the reality is, we've been planning to retire the shuttle for about two or three years. So we've been slowly shutting down production lines. The solid rocket motors, the two white things that sit on the side of the shuttle, those are pretty much complete, in terms of manufacturing. The large external tanks, the big oranges things you see, we've stopped manufacturing those.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we'd have to bring back all those facilities, and put all the stuff back in place. And it also comes down to money. That we need to take some of the dollars that are going into the shuttle program, and put them into this next program to do these things to get beyond lower-earth orbit. So if we want to go do these other things, we've gotta kind of give up something we liked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: But it seems like what NASA's allowed to do has a lot to do with Congress, and money, right? Is that the bane of your existence? I mean, first there was this Constellation program [a human spaceflight program canceled this year], and then, "No, no, no, let's not do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: I think our problem is that things we do take a long time. We can't just turn on a dime when somebody says, "Let's go do something different." We actually put three years of planning in place, and then start manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And doesn't work well today, because 'cause most folks don't see that. They want us to just immediately go to something different. And why can't you just do that? Or why can't we just keep flying the shuttle? It's not that easy for us. And we need to do a better job of explaining to folks how difficult it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's on us, NASA, to craft together an innovative, creative, agile program that can adapt to the environment that we live in, with lots of changes coming at us from different directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: Do all the changes-in budget, in Congress-drive you crazy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: No. It's our world. The neat thing is that we're given a tremendous privilege by the U.S. taxpayer to do what we do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: What do you feel as you see the shuttle program winding down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: I feel a little sadness, a little bit, because I know what we can continue to keep doing with this shuttle. It would be nice if that other program was coming along a little bit faster, and we could kind of roll right from this program to the next one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I think we can still use that same workforce to re-tool, build solid plans and then kind of get ready to go move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apollo astronauts said that, basically by going to the moon, we learned more about the earth than we did by staying here. And those first images from the surface of the moon, of the earthrise, seeing the earth as a sphere, with this thin atmosphere, really pushes how fragile our world is, and how small our world is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By continuing to push the technology envelope, we really learn a lot more about what's really happening here on the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: The space shuttle that we use to get to the space station is now retired. So how are we gonna get back and forth now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: We're gonna use the Soyuz spacecraft, which we've been actually using for crew rotations for about the last two years. We've focused the shuttle on doing the assembly activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: We rent space on the Russian aircraft?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: Yep. Our crews are trained in Russia to operate and help them fly the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: And doesn't that bother anyone? I mean, doesn't that make us sort of second-class space citizens?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: I don't really look at it that way. Because if you look at the space station, it's really an international facility. So there are Russian modules. There's also a Japanese module. The European space agency has another module. And the U.S. has a large research facility. We provide power to the Russian side-our solar rays generate power, and provide it to the Russian side. And they do propulsion for us on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when you ask me about transportation, it's not different than all these other dependencies I have already. We are truly an international team. It's not competition like it was before, where we're gonna beat the Russians, or we're gonna beat the Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a control center in Moscow, a control center in Houston, a control center in Japan, and also in Europe. And we all work together to keep this space station flying, and operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: But isn't there another component, too, about working with commercial space outfits? How does that work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: The Russians are a good partner. But from a technology standpoint, it's nice to have a redundant capability. So we would like to establish another way to get crews and cargo to the space station, and we're looking now to the commercial industry to go do that for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're saying: can the commercial industry step up without NASA's direct involvement, and do some of this on their own? So we've got a contract in place with Orbital Space Corporation and Space-X.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And these two companies are gonna provide services to us, probably starting the end of this year, and next year, to carry cargo to station. We didn't participate in the design of their rockets. We're kind of overseeing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the next follow-on step is then they can move into crew transportation. And then that will back up what the Russians have, we'll do an overlap period between the two, and then we'll be able to go carry our own crews, in maybe the 2016 timeframe, with the U.S. commercial provider to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So instead of us paying the Russians, like we've been, we will be paying the commercial providers on the U.S. side to go do that. They also get to use a lot of NASA's technology as they build their rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that's a model that works well. NASA does the things that are hard, gets it to a point, and then it's ready to be handed off to commercial industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: So what is the vision, then, now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: We're not gonna pick a destination, but we're gonna build a series of spacecraft, and vehicles, and technologies that we can put together to go do a mission when it comes time to go do a mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're gonna start out now with a multi-purpose crew vehicle, which is essentially a capsule. It houses about four crew members. It allows you to go to destinations well beyond lower-earth orbit, and return with a heat-shield capability, and the life support systems.Then we need a rocket that can carry large mass. We need some big rockets, similar to what we had been in Saturn, that can get large components to space, that then can be assembled to go to some farther destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may need a Lander, if we're gonna land on, say, the moon. Or we're gonna go to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the idea is to identify all these pieces that we need, and then start working on those kind of incrementally as funding allows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: And is it safe to say, then, that there will be sort of a quiet period between shuttle, and the next thing that NASA develops?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: I wouldn't call it a quiet period. (LAUGHTER) I'd call it the International Space Station Period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've got this huge research facility built in space. Now we need to take that same energy that we put into assembly, and turn it into research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, we've been working with salmonella in space. And it turns out that it differentiates in different strains when it goes into space. And we're not sure exactly why. And it also becomes stronger. It becomes more virulent. We can return those specimens to the ground. We can then do genetic engineering and create a salmonella that's strong enough to cause the immune reaction in the human, but not strong enough to give you the disease. So we have the ability now to, essentially, create a vaccine for salmonella. And it's about ready to go into FDA trials here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same thing with MRSA, that drug-resistant bacteria in hospitals. Same thing with flu virus. This same phenomenon occurs in space. It's like when we went to Africa to go look for new plants, to help give us new ideas for pharmaceuticals, and drugs. It's the same kind of thing. You go to this new environment of space, without gravity, things function very differently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that's this next phase. We may not be doing the big, fancy missions, but if we pull this off, we are gonna show that space has real applications to us here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: I've read some really negative criticisms of the Space Station. One was saying that compared with the number of scientific papers that the Hubble has generated, the space station, so far, has been sort of a flop. It hasn't generated nearly as much good science. Is that true?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: Our problem's been that we were so busy building this thing, we really haven't had a chance to really focus on the research side. That's this next phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you remember, when Hubble first launched, it had problems with its optics. And there were lots of folks then who said, "the Hubble really wasn't worthwhile. And we should just end this thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we were able to go up and fix the Hubble. And you've seen all the images that have come from it since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we keep pushing, we've got a chance with space station to push that research in various areas, that'll be just as exciting, and give the return that you see with the Hubble. So I would say the jury's still out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DP: Well, I guess the last thing is: in a nutshell, can you characterize the Shuttle? Its achievements, its lifespan? Give it a eulogy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WG: What the shuttle has really done is, it's shown that we can actually go to work in space. It's a place where humans belong. A place where humans can work, live, operate. It's taken that first step beyond the earth, out to broader places, that we'll go someday, out beyond lower-earth orbit. Potentially back to the moon, or to near-earth asteroids, or whatever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that first step really came from the shuttle. It shows what we can do if we all work together, and pull together as a team: we can accomplish some pretty amazing things.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran said it launched a satellite into orbit on Wednesday that Western aerospace experts said could be used for limited military reconnaissance and also to monitor crops and track damage from earthquakes, flooding and other natural disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second time that an Iranian rocket had carried a satellite into orbit and took place more than two years after Iran joined the international space club by launching its first satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran released few details about the satellite, which it calls Rasad-1, or Observation-1. Western experts said it weighed about 100 pounds -- meaning that the light payload and the modest rocket carrying it bore little resemblance to an intercontinental missile and its heavy warhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, aerospace experts said the successful launching demonstrated Iranian engineers' growing skill and contrasted with the repeated failures endured by North Korea in trying to place payloads into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a significant step forward for the Iranians,'' said Charles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at GlobalSecurity.org, a private research group in Alexandria, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it did not come as a surprise to those who monitor Iran's efforts. ''Everybody's been expecting this,'' said Marcia S. Smith, founder of SpacePolicyOnline.com, a news blog in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vick noted that the Iranians had announced that Rasad-1 would be lofted last summer, but the mission then was delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's taken them far longer than they advertised,'' Mr. Vick said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason, he added, appeared to be managerial failures and ''sanctions that have been having a significant impact on their getting foreign technology and hardware.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the Iranian satellite as an experimental craft designed mainly for tracking the Earth's resources from space. But the spacecraft, he said, ''could also be used for low-resolution reconnaissance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian news reports said that the Rasad-1 was built by the Malek-Ashtar University. Analysts in the American intelligence community view the university as having close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, the Islamic Republic's main enforcers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian scientists have long hailed the benefits of Earth-observation satellites for tracking floods, fighting fires, gauging earthquake damage, finding evacuation routes and identifying high-risk areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced plans to launch several Iranian-built satellites this year, including at least one for reconnaissance. He also repeated a claim that Tehran would send an Iranian astronaut into space by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran placed its first satellite into orbit in February 2009. The nation's 5,000 rial banknote, the equivalent of 50 cents, bears the satellite's image. The Iranians called it a rudimentary communications craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the launching on Wednesday came on the country's Arabic-language television channel, Al-Alam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The channel said a rocket known as Safir, or messenger, fired the satellite into an orbit with a maximum height of 162 miles. ''It is capable of photographing the Earth,'' the report said of the satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The channel said Rasad-1 would circle the Earth 15 times a day and should operate for two months. Iranian media reports have said the Safir rocket can carry a satellite weighing 110 pounds into elliptical orbits as high as 280 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western nations fear that Iran is trying to develop a missile capability under cover of its space program that could also threaten to deliver nuclear warheads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran denies that it has any ambition to develop an atom bomb and asserts that both its space and nuclear programs are peaceful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is openly developing a group of increasingly large rockets. In theory, the biggest might eventually be powerful enough to hurl not only satellites into space, but also warheads between continents.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, many planetary scientists did not express much curiosity about Mercury, which looked gray and cratered -- a slightly larger version of the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But data released Thursday from NASA's Mercury Messenger spacecraft, which entered orbit around Mercury in March, is painting a more vibrant picture of the solar system's innermost planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mercury ain't the Moon,'' Ralph L. McNutt Jr., the mission's project scientist, said at a NASA news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new findings: Some of Mercury's topography is not seen anywhere else in the solar system -- rimless pits, for instance -- and its mineralogy is vastly different from the Moon's, whose rocks have much less potassium. Scientists already knew that Mercury has a magnetic field, while the Moon does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest batch of data includes the clearest pictures yet of Mercury's polar regions, plus readings of the elements in its crust, which have helped scientists rule out some theories about the planet's origins. Mercury Messenger has also discovered that the planet's magnetic field is stronger in its northern hemisphere than in its southern, which hints at something odd in the structure of its molten core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new information could reveal how Mercury formed and changed over the 4.5-billion-year history of the solar system, which in turn could help astronomers understand the panoply of Earth-size planets around other stars and the possibility of conditions friendly for life on them. NASA's Kepler telescope has discovered dozens of possible Earth-size planets, but its observations can determine little beyond their size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have in our solar system four experiments in how four Earthlike planets evolve once they form under slightly different conditions,'' said Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator for Mercury Messenger, referring to Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, the four rocky planets of the inner solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're learning is that each of those experiments had an extraordinarily different outcome,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''And one of those experiments we live on. So it really behooves us, in a very general way, to understand how Earthlike planets form and evolve and operate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the mysteries is why the iron core of Mercury is unusually large, extending out three-quarters of the way to the surface. Earth's core, by contrast, extends a little more than halfway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea was that Mercury was originally larger, and the young Sun was so intense that the radiation stripped away the outer layers, leaving behind the Mercury seen today. But that theory predicted low abundances of certain elements like potassium that would have easily evaporated in the intense heat. Mercury Messenger measured ample amounts of potassium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can rule out this kind of model,'' said Larry R. Nittler, a staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and a member of the science team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another theory is that Mercury formed out of metal-rich meteorites. By and large, the observed composition of the surface rocks does not fit with that theory either, although a variation could still prove the correct explanation, Dr. Nittler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third idea is that a giant impact early in Mercury's history knocked off a large fraction of the planet. ''This is the model that is still in the running,'' Dr. Nittler said. ''There are probably going to be many more models devised before we have an answer on this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-resolution images of craters revealed irregular pits, ranging in width from several hundred feet to a few miles. The pits do not have rims like craters produced by impacts, leading the scientists to speculate that they were etched by some unstable material that evaporated quickly when exposed at the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury Messenger's one-year mission around the planet is only one-quarter done, so more information about the planet will be forthcoming. Already, Dr. Solomon said, the orbiter has dispelled the misconception that Mercury is a boring place, and that what NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft saw in 1974 and 1975 during three flybys was all that was to be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some even in the planetary community, after the Mariner 10 mission, placed a low priority on returning a spacecraft to Mercury on the grounds that it was very much like the Moon, we'd been to the Moon,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''It was an example, to use a phrase coined by a very famous space scientist, of 'one of the burnt-out cinders of the solar system.' And it is anything but that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LATELY, the Sun has been behaving a bit strangely. In 2008 and 2009, it showed the least surface activity in nearly a century. Solar flare activity stopped cold and weeks and months went by without any sunspots, or areas of intense magnetism. Quiet spells are normal for the Sun, but researchers alive today had never seen anything like that two-year hibernation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the Sun is approaching the peak of its magnetic cycle, when solar storms -- blasts of electrically charged magnetic clouds -- are most likely to occur, no one can predict how it will behave. Will solar activity continue to be sluggish, or will solar storms rage with renewed vigor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, policy makers are paying attention to space weather. Late last month, President Obama and the British prime minister David Cameron announced that the United States and Britain will work together to create ''a fully operational global space weather warning system.'' And just last week, the United Nations pledged to upgrade its space weather forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most people have never heard of space weather, which is a problem, because both high and low solar activity have serious effects on life on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern society depends on a variety of technologies that are susceptible to the extremes of space weather. Spectacular explosions on the Sun's surface produce solar storms of intense magnetism and radiation. These events can disrupt the operation of power grids, railway signaling, magnetic surveying and drilling for oil and gas. Magnetic storms also heat the upper atmosphere, changing its density and composition and disrupting radio communications and GPS units. The storms' charged particles can be a hazard to the health of astronauts and passengers on high altitude flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severe storms in 1989 and 2003 caused blackouts in Canada and Sweden. In 1859, a solar super storm sparked fires in telegraph offices. Such storms are predicted every century or so, and perhaps we're overdue. According to a 2008 National Academies report, a once-in-a-century solar storm could cause the financial damage of 20 Hurricane Katrinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quiet Sun causes its own problems. During the two-year quiet spell, our upper atmosphere, normally heated and inflated by the Sun's extreme ultraviolet radiation, cooled off and shrank. This altered the propagation of GPS signals and slowed the rate of decay of space debris in low Earth orbit. In addition, the cosmic rays that are normally pushed out to the fringes of the solar system by solar explosions instead surged around Earth, threatening astronauts and satellites with unusually high levels of radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more we know about solar activity, the better we can protect ourselves. The Sun is surrounded by a fleet of spacecraft that can see sunspots forming, flares crackling and a solar storm about 30 minutes before it hits Earth. NASA and the National Science Foundation have also developed sophisticated models to predict where solar storms will go once they leave the Sun, akin to National Weather Service programs that track hurricanes and tornadoes on Earth. Thanks to these sentries, it is increasingly difficult for the Sun to take us by surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If alerted, Internet server hubs, telecommunications centers and financial institutions can prepare for disruptions and power plant operators can disconnect transformers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what good are space weather alerts if people don't understand them and won't react to them? Consider the following: If anyone should be familiar with the risks of space weather, it's a pilot. During solar storms, transpolar flights are routinely diverted because the storms can disrupt the planes' communications equipment. And yet a space weather forecaster we know at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration often tells a story of a conversation he had with a pilot:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pilot: ''What do you do for a living?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecaster: ''I forecast space weather.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pilot: ''Really? What's that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point of the story is to highlight how far the scientific community and the government have to go to raise awareness about space weather and its effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the sun waking up, trans-Atlantic cooperation comes at just the right time. Let us hope it is only the beginning of a worldwide effort to forecast and understand space weather.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN March 1969, Charles M. Schulz created six sequential ''Peanuts'' cartoon strips following the pensive beagle Snoopy on a journey to the moon and back. They not only reflected America's anticipation of Apollo 11 -- the first manned lunar landing, which would take place in July of that year -- but also drew on the relationship between NASA and the ''Peanuts'' gang. That connection is the subject of ''To the Moon: Snoopy Soars With NASA,'' now on view at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition made its debut in 2009 at the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, Calif., to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 10 mission, which took place in May 1969 as a dress rehearsal for Apollo 11. The Apollo 10 crew had chosen ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'' as the respective call names for their command and lunar modules. While the astronaut John W. Young orbited the moon in ''Charlie Brown,'' Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan piloted ''Snoopy'' within 50,000 feet of the moon's surface to scout a landing area for Apollo 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To the Moon,'' organized by Jane O'Cain, the curator of the Schulz Museum, examines the Apollo 10 mission through a ''beagle-has-landed'' lens and addresses Snoopy's role as NASA's safety mascot since 1968. Among the artifacts on display are a reproduction of Mr. Schulz's earliest sketch of Snoopy as an astronaut and a two-by-three-inch segment of Apollo 10's Mylar coating retrieved at splashdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An audio-visual presentation features footage of Earth and the moon's surface taken during the flight (Apollo 10 was the first mission to provide live color telecasts from space) and video clips of the crew reminiscing about the mission. A case of memorabilia contains ''Astronaut Snoopy'' merchandise from the period, including dolls, a piggy bank, and ceramic salt and pepper shakers. A children's area features dress-up astronaut suits and, for a space-themed photo op, a model of an Apollo 10 astronaut with an opening for a child's face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As safety mascot, Snoopy, his head engulfed in a space helmet, appears on numerous NASA posters and on the highly prized Silver Snoopy lapel pins, which are flown into space during missions and then awarded by NASA's astronaut office to those who have contributed to the human space flight program. Visitors to ''To the Moon'' will find a Silver Snoopy and a selection of posters. In one, signed by Mr. Schulz, Snoopy poses alongside three astronauts. Its message reads, ''Wherever they go... He goes!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of ''To the Moon'' is from the Schulz Museum's traveling exhibition, the Stamford Museum, which has an observatory on its grounds, has added several pieces from its own collections. There are models of a lunar landing module and a Saturn rocket, both produced by NASA in the 1960s, and a moon camera used before the Apollo missions. Also on display is a print of a partial eclipse by Etienne Leopold Trouvelot, a 19th-century French artist and astronomer whose work was exhibited at the Stamford Museum in May. And in conjunction with ''To the Moon,'' the museum's ''Astronomy Nights'' series will include ''History of the Apollo Program,'' a lecture by Robert Morrow, a science teacher at Fairfield Warde High School in Fairfield, followed by an opportunity (weather permitting) to see the night sky through the observatory's 22-inch telescope. The lecture is scheduled for July 8, the target date for the launch of the space shuttleAtlantis on its final flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosa Portell, the curator of collections at the Stamford Museum, recalled watching the Apollo missions as a child and the enthusiasm they generated. For her, the winding down of NASA's space shuttle program intensifies the memories evoked by the exhibit. ''As the program is approaching its end,'' Ms. Portell said, ''suddenly everyone seems very nostalgic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To the Moon: Snoopy Soars With NASA'' runs through Aug. 21 in the Bendel Mansion Museum Galleries at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 39 Scofieldtown Road, Stamford. ''Astronomy Nights: History of the Apollo Program,'' recommended for ages 5 and up, is at 7:30 p.m. on July 8; $3, $2 for ages 5 to 17. For more information: stamfordmuseum.org or (203) 322-1646.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 29, 1995, the shuttle Atlantis and the Russian space station Mir docked, forming the largest man-made satellite ever to orbit the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times article about the event noted the broader significance: "The docking was a picture-perfect start to what American and Russian space officials see as decades of cooperative work in space, including the building of an international outpost bigger than a football field and perhaps one day voyaging to other planets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis spent five days docked with the Mir as the 10 astronauts conducted biomedical and scientific investigations. At the end of the trip, the three cosmonauts who had been living on Mir left in the Atlantis with the five NASA astronauts, leaving the two Atlantis cosmonauts in their place. It was the first in-orbit change-out of shuttle crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mir had been launched into space by the Soviet Union in 1986,with a planned mission of five years. It lasted three times longer than expected, being finally taken out of service in 2001 after the International Space Station was launched.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>687 words</div><div>29 June 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the hundreds of thousands of pieces of space-age litter orbiting Earth zipped uncomfortably close to the International Space Station on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six crew members of the space station took refuge in their ''lifeboats'' -- two Soyuz space capsules they would use to escape a crippled station -- as the unidentified object hurtled past them at a speed of 29,000 miles per hour, missing the space station by only 1,100 feet. The episode took place at 8:08 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe the probability that it would the hit the station was about 1 in 360,'' said Lark Howorth, who leads the team at NASA that tracks the space station's trajectory. NASA rules call for precautions when the risk of impact is greater than 1 in 10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the section of the station run by the United States, astronauts closed the hatches in case the debris -- commonly known as space junk -- crashed through, to limit the danger of explosive decompression. To prepare for a rapid departure, the clamps holding the Soyuz capsules to the station were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They would be one command away from releasing the hooks and undocking,'' said Edward Van Cise, NASA's lead flight director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission controllers gave the all-clear signal four minutes later, and the crew members returned to work. There was no sign of damage or impact to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only the second time in the 10-year history of people living on the space station that the crew needed to take such precautions; on March 12, 2009, a piece of an old satellite motor went zipping by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the station had been hit, the crew could have quickly undocked and returned to Earth. The risk of space junk hitting a Soyuz capsule is much slimmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, when NASA gets a warning, several days in advance, that something that might come too close to the station, it moves the station by firing thrusters. Or, if a space shuttle happened to be visiting at the time, the shuttle would nudge the station out of danger. That has happened 12 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, however, the warning came Monday evening, less than 15 hours in advance, too little time to plan a maneuver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched was in 1957, the space neighborhood has become cluttered with human-made detritus -- more than half a million pieces, by recent estimates, from the size of a marble on up. If the orbits of two intersect, the result can be a destructive collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's getting kind of dangerous,'' said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has become an expert on space debris. ''Most active satellites now have a regular process of maneuvering to avoid debris.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA estimates that for each six-month period, there is a 1-in-100 chance that some or all of the space station crew might need to evacuate, and most of that risk comes from the possibility of impact from debris or natural micrometeroids. Over 10 years, the current planned lifetime of the station, the cumulative risk is nearly one in five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's at the level where it probably won't happen in the lifetime of the station, but it could easily,'' Dr. McDowell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debris includes spent rocket stages, and sometimes over time residual fuel combines and explodes. ''You now no longer have a rocket stage,'' Dr. McDowell said. ''You have 500 pieces of shrapnel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also still in orbit are broken satellites or almost incidental litter. In the past, lens covers on satellite cameras and sensors were simply popped off and left to float away. Now satellite makers put the lens cap on a hinge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Military antisatellite tests also make a big mess, notably when the Chinese blew up one of their satellites in 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As NASA prepares to launch its last space shuttle -- ending 30 years in which large teams of creative scientists and engineers sent winged spaceships into orbit -- it is facing what may be a bigger challenge: a brain drain that threatens to undermine safety as well as the agency's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space experts say the best and brightest often head for the doors when rocket lines get marked for extinction, dampening morale and creating hidden threats. They call it the ''Team B'' effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good guys see the end coming and leave,'' said Albert D. Wheelon, a former aerospace executive and Central Intelligence Agency official. ''You're left with the B students.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA acknowledges the effect and its attendant dangers. It has taken hundreds of steps, including retention bonuses for skilled employees, new perks like travel benefits and more safety drills. Through cuts and attrition in recent years, the shuttle work force has declined to 7,000 workers from about 17,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downsizing has been well managed and has achieved an acceptable level of risk,'' said Joseph W. Dyer, a retired Navy vice admiral and the chairman of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. After a slow start, ''NASA and its industry partners did a genuinely excellent job'' in planning for the shuttle's retirement, he said. But he conceded, ''There's added risk anytime you downsize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody is predicting problems for the coming flight of the Atlantis, the 135th and last launching in the shuttle program. The event is scheduled for Friday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, before an estimated one million spectators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, there is little glory to look forward to. NASA has been forced to cancel the big missions that capture public attention and attract top talent, and frustrations have bubbled to the surface within the agency. Not only has the shuttle program been scrapped, but so has Constellation, which would have sent Americans back to the moon. Astronauts have been steadily leaving the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the direction of the Obama administration and Congress, NASA is instead developing a large new rocket to send deep into space. But no destination has been selected, and money is tight. NASA is also trying to nurture a commercial industry that will loft astronauts toward the stars. But the ventures, which involve partnerships with private-sector companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, focus on hardware development and so far have no declared goals beyond low orbits around the planet. The shuttles did that for decades, starting in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview last week, Charles F. Bolden Jr., NASA's administrator and a former astronaut, said he had no misgivings about the last shuttle flight, and he heaped praise on the agency's work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do we have concerns about morale?'' he asked. ''Yes, we always do. Do we have concerns about the welfare of our workers? Yes, we always do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bolden, a retired Marine Corps general, said his workers were excited not only about the Atlantis mission but also about a range of new endeavors at both the space agency and its commercial partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to help our people stay in the aerospace industry, if not in NASA,'' he said while denying any paralyzing loss of talent. ''We're capturing the brainpower.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he flatly rejected the idea that the agency had lost its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not adrift,'' he said. ''And the vision is not gone. And we have a plan. We have a very sound plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History has offered some bleak lessons, with tons of wreckage testifying to the danger. Experts say the Team B effect contributed to disasters in the mid-1980s and late 1990s that destroyed more than a dozen rockets, wiped out billions of dollars in satellites and threw the nation's unpiloted space program into turmoil. The two catastrophes of the space shuttle program -- in 1986 and 2003, which killed 14 astronauts -- had more to do with design flaws and management failures than with depleted ranks of experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials say close examinations of failures and problematic retirements have made the agency smarter. ''We went out and looked at who has done this well -- and who has not,'' said Bryan D. O'Connor, NASA's chief of safety and mission assurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There could be something we missed,'' he added. ''But I feel pretty confident about the last flight -- it's going to be just as safe as any we've ever had, if not more so, with just as good people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reached a somewhat different conclusion in its annual report. It warned that ''the lack of a defined mission can negatively affect work force morale'' at NASA, and said the agency's own field centers portrayed the loss of big missions as having already ''increased the potential for risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future ambitions might also suffer, the panel warned, because a lack of visionary goals can undermine ''the ability to attract and maintain the necessary skill sets needed for this high-technology venture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the dissatisfaction erupted at the Kennedy Space Center. Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director for the Atlantis, went off-message with colleagues after conducting a safety drill for the coming flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The end of the shuttle program is a tough thing to swallow, and we're all victims of poor policy out of Washington,'' he told his launching team, according to nasaspaceflight.com, a news site. ''I'm embarrassed that we don't have better guidance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the nation's programs for putting astronauts into space ''always had something to transition into'' for half a century. ''Now,'' he added, ''we don't have anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The room erupted in applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bolden, the NASA administrator, was gracious about the episode. Asked about Mr. Leinbach, he offered nothing but praise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. O'Connor, the NASA safety chief, said the agency had taken many steps to ensure that staff reductions did not leave the remaining Atlantis workers feeling overtaxed. For instance, he said, schedules have been stretched out to make sure that the corps of technical experts had sufficient time for troubleshooting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have the bench strength we once had,'' Mr. O'Connor conceded. ''We've got fewer people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dyer, the chairman of Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said the inquiries of his own team suggested that the shuttle work force remained dedicated to doing the best job possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of investigating the darker moments of the shuttle program, he admitted to personal unease about its end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll breathe more easily,'' Mr. Dyer said, ''after the last flight.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By April 1981 it seemed that the space shuttle Columbia had been part of the Florida landscape forever. Gleaming white in the sun by day and the floodlights that bathed it all night, the cluster of rockets, space plane and giant egglike fuel tank looked like a craggy Matterhorn transposed to the humid coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was surely too big to ever move, and yet the fate of the nation seemed to depend on its doing so. Months earlier I had traveled with a group of science writers on a weeklong junket through the nation's space centers. In California, we walked underneath the next shuttle, Challenger, where Rockwell workers were gluing the fragile heat-resistant tiles to its body. At Cape Canaveral, our private jet touched down on the shuttle landing strip and we were taken within hailing distance of the waiting shuttle, close enough to see soldiers patrolling the launching pad with machine guns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle was a big deal then. But now, after 30 years of shuttle flights, the last mission ever is being prepped for its launching on Friday. Humans are no closer to the stars than before, and the space program is in tatters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until that trip past the pad in 1981, the space program was something I had watched on a grainy little black-and-white TV at my apartment in Cambridge, Mass. Raised on science fiction, I knew the script: First we take the Moon, then Mars. That in fact was the vision pushed in 1969 by NASA's administrator, Thomas O. Paine, and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, but President Richard M. Nixon didn't bite and history didn't go according to plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1981, a decade after the glories of the Apollo Moon landings, it had been six years since Americans had last ventured into space, and editorialists were lamenting the ''retreat from space.'' The reusable space shuttle was supposed to make spaceflight cheap and almost as routine as air travel, and satellite launchings as uneventful as delivering the mail. There was money to be made in space and a slate of ''black missions'' to keep the nation secure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shuttle was late and over budget. Those thermal tiles, vital to protecting it from the searing heat of re-entry, had an embarrassing habit of flaking off. Some people called it the Flying Brickyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, overruns and delays had drastically depleted the agency's resources for science. NASA couldn't even afford to send a mission to Halley's Comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the scientists I know would be thrilled to see humans exploring space, landing on Mars, for example -- they just don't think that science should pick up the check. Many of them were suspicious of the shuttle, both because of the cost drain and because making instruments like the space telescope compatible with it would compromise the potential science, restricting them to low earth orbit, for example, and making them hostage to the exigencies of human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But politically, if not technically, the shuttle and the space telescope needed each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mountain did move on April 12, 1981. We got up at midnight to drive on back roads through Cape Canaveral Air Station and then eat peanut butter crackers in our cars waiting for the dawn and the new space age. When the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets went off, it was like a second sunrise blasting our greasy faces. The Alps vanished atop a biblical tower of smoke and flame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, when John W. Young and Robert L. Crippen glided back down in the Mojave Desert, the double crack of Columbia's sonic boom sounded like a message from the gods. Elated to be arriving in dignity like test pilots rather than cargo plopping into the ocean, the astronauts proceeded to strut around the shuttle inspecting it for nicks and dings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, soon we were in the era of the space truck to nowhere, easy travel to orbit and the sight of astronauts frolicking like weightless baby sea lions in the capacious shuttle decks and laboratories. Women, scientists, a congressman and a senator, not to mention an array of guest astronauts from other countries, logged time in orbit, performing scientific experiments, often on one another. Captain Young, who had been to the Moon twice, redefined the notion of the ''right stuff'' when he was pictured in his command chair in his reading glasses looking over flight plans. Judith A. Resnik redefined it further when her long curly locks floated on orbit like a dark corona about her head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald E. McNair, a physicist, brought his saxophone to play in space. There was talk of flying a schoolteacher in space, and even a journalist. We learned that about a third of astronauts suffered bouts of space sickness, until NASA declared that such topics were not fit for public discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was thrilling to watch astronauts blast off on smoke pillars, but after a while it was irritating that they weren't going anywhere but in circles around the Earth and the science they were doing was mostly boring compared with the results being beamed back from the Voyager spacecraft exploring the outer planets at considerably less expense and risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why were we there? I recall one newspaper reporter asking out loud at one launching before answering himself. ''We're on a death watch,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle had been declared ''operational'' after four flights, but it could never be routine. Gravity might be the weakest force in nature, as the physicists tell us, but the violence needed to overcome it and release us from the Earth was revelatory to me when I actually saw it in action up close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then I totally bought the idea of reusable spacecraft -- after all, the space age had begun with rocket planes like the X-15 that went up and glided back down. But the shuttle's design had been compromised by politics and economics -- a more expensive and safer version would have put the crew far above, as on the towering Moon rockets, rather than surrounded by booster rockets and a giant fuel tank in the clunky arrangement that prevailed -- and NASA's managers were drinking their own Kool-Aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, I was crossing the parking lot at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., on my way in for the last day of Voyager 2's encounter with Uranus, when a reporter from USA Today came running out and into a phone booth. I asked him about the impending launching of Challenger, with the schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe aboard. ''It blew up,'' he blurted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I went inside to find my colleagues in the press room staring hollow-eyed at television screens. Half of the screens showed Uranus, looking like a big eye surrounded by its tenuous rings; the other half showed the Y-shaped cloud that was all that was left of Challenger and its crew of seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buck Rogers dreams died that day. They died a second death on Feb. 1, 2003, when the Columbia broke apart on re-entry, killing another seven people, after foam insulation had punched a hole in the wing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't catch up with the space shuttle again until 1993, when I watched the astronauts train like underwater ballet dancers in a pool in Huntsville, Ala., to carry out repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope, which had been famously and humiliatingly launched with a misshapen mirror. Late one day, an engineer suggested that Story Musgrave, the lead astronaut on that crew, change his routine and turn around at one point to adjust his torque wrench. Dr. Musgrave dressed him down, saying such last-minute changes put the mission in danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble missions, five in all, were the shuttle's finest hours. In the end, of course, the Hubble did need the shuttle, and its astronauts. It all came to a wonderful high-tech, low-tech climax two years ago, when Michael J. Massimino, channeling his Uncle Frank fixing a car on Long Island, yanked a handrail off the side of the telescope to get at a broken spectrograph underneath it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spectrograph could someday give us a clue to finding another Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble is alone now with the stars, its vision as peerless as designed. But America still has no vision at all for its space program, no plan for where to go next or how.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't blame NASA for that. NASA works for the president, and the president can do only what Congress will give him or her the money for. And Congress answers to the people -- that is to say, its campaign contributors. They've all just been doing what they think they have to do, but an astronomer I know who grew up with the same science fiction dreams and expectations as I did once described himself as a member of the ''cheated generation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I no longer expect to see boot prints on Mars during my lifetime, nor do I expect that whoever eventually makes those boot prints will be drawing a paycheck from NASA, or even speaking English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During shuttle missions, you couldn't wander past the old Saturn 5 rockets sitting outside at the Johnson and Kennedy Space Centers and not wonder in awe what giants had built these rockets that had sent humans all the way to the Moon. I can't help feeling that someday we'll walk past those shuttles now on their way to museums and admire their creature comforts and flexibility and the aerodynamic research that went into learning how to fly at Mach 25. And wonder who built them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish Commander Christopher Ferguson and his comrades a safe and glorious flight aboard their flawed but magnificent chariot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And bigger and braver dreams for us all in the future.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Normally, when NASA launches a space shuttle, there are either six or seven astronauts aboard. So why, on the 135th and final launching of the 30-year-old space shuttle program, will there be only four?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, perhaps not surprisingly, has to do with the Atlantis's being the last flight: With no spare shuttle available to go and rescue the astronauts in case something goes wrong, the Americans would have to turn to the Russians to retrieve their crew from the International Space Station. And the Russian spacecraft -- known as Soyuz capsules -- hold only three astronauts, so two people would have to fly up and bring home the Americans one at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very low likelihood case,'' Atlantis's commander, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, said last week during a news conference. But the agency's safety experts have ''done an extraordinarily thorough job of making sure we have a good plan to get home,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis is scheduled to leave from here at 11:26 a.m. on Friday, making its 33rd flight. But the forecast on Wednesday was for only a 30 percent chance of acceptable weather, so the launching could be delayed until Sunday or beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, the countdown was proceeding smoothly. ''There are no problems yet,'' Michael P. Moses, the launching integration manager, said Wednesday at a news conference. ''There are just weather forecasts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And about a million spectators are expected to show up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's other two orbiters, the Discovery and the Endeavour, have completed their flying careers and are being primped for display in museums. The Atlantis was supposed to be retired now, too. NASA had prepared it as a rescue vehicle for the last flight of the Endeavour, in May, and it would have gotten off the ground only if the Endeavour had encountered trouble while in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after spending hundreds of millions of dollars getting the Atlantis ready to fly, NASA officials said it made sense to fly it regardless, to carry additional supplies to the space station. And this decision required alternate contingency plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the explosion of the Columbia eight years ago, which killed the seven astronauts on board, the space agency carefully drew up plans for what to do if an orbiter reached space safely but was damaged and could not return. Columbia was damaged during liftoff when a piece of debris struck one of its wings, creating a hole that caused the shuttle to break up on its way back to earth. Investigators subsequently concluded that the problem could have been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For each post-Columbia shuttle trip to the International Space Station, astronauts have inspected the orbiter's underside for damage to the heat shield similar to the puncture in Columbia's left wing caused by falling foam. The plan was that if any such damage were found, the astronauts would remain at the space station until the next shuttles arrived and carried them home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, if there were such a problem, it would be the smaller, three-seat Soyuz capsules that brought the astronauts home. Over the following year, the Soyuzes would launch with a crew of two instead of three, and a shuttle astronaut would take the empty seat on the return trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extended stay for seven stranded shuttle astronauts, in addition to the station's six crew members, would exhaust the station's food and supplies. But with four unexpected guests, the strain on the station would be manageable. ''We'll be able to, I think, sort of assimilate into space station life fairly straightforwardly, if it would happen,'' said Sandra H. Magnus, a member of the Atlantis crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four astronauts -- Captain Ferguson; Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the Marines; Dr. Magnus; and Rex J. Walheim, a retired Air Force colonel -- are experienced space fliers, and all four will be busy during the 12-day mission, moving 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having four folks who have done this at least once in the past will add dramatically to our efficiency on orbit,'' Captain Ferguson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there may be some advantages to the smaller crew. ''There are less opinions to contend with,'' Captain Ferguson said, drawing some laughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the last day before landing is expected to be particularly hectic, with the four performing tasks usually divided among six or seven. The Atlantis is to return to Kennedy Space Center on July 20, although NASA could extend the mission by a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the retirement of the shuttles, NASA will be counting on two companies, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif., and <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span>, of Dulles, Va., to carry supplies to the space station. The additional Atlantis flight provides a cushion in case of further delays by the companies, keeping the station supplied through next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for short, successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket twice last year, but will get at most one off the ground this year. The next flight, a demonstration to show that it can navigate its space capsule to the station, has been delayed from spring to late fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Orbital suffered a setback last month when an engine for its rocket caught fire in testing. Orbital still hopes to launch a demonstration flight this year and begin taking supplies to the station next year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House Appropriations Committee proposed Wednesday to kill the James Webb Space Telescope, the crown jewel of NASA's astronomy plans for the next two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope, named after a former administrator of NASA, is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it was designed to study the first stars and galaxies that emerged in the first hundred million years or so after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was supposed to be launched in 2014, but NASA said last year that the project would require at least an additional $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, because of mismanagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week, NASA announced that it had finished polishing all the segments of the telescope's mirror, which is 6.5 meters in diameter, but the agency has still not announced a new plan for testing and launching the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the telescope's potential demise came as part of a draft budget for NASA and other agencies, including the Commerce and Justice Departments. In all, the committee proposed lopping $1.6 billion off NASA's current budget, which is $18.4 billion for 2011. The Obama administration had originally requested $18.7 billion for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reacted with immediate dismay, fearing that the death of the Webb telescope could have the same dire impact on American astronomy that killing the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator in Texas, did in 1993 for American physics, sending leadership abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canceling the Webb telescope would ''have a profound impact on astrophysics far into the future, threatening U.S. leadership in space science,'' said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which would run the new telescope. ''This is particularly disappointing at a time when the nation is struggling to inspire students to take up science and engineering,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, echoed his view. ''This would be an unmitigated disaster for cosmology,'' he said. ''After two decades of pushing the Hubble to its limits, which has revolutionized astronomy, the next step would be to pack up and give up. The Hubble is just good enough to see what we're missing at the start of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope, he said, ''would bring it home in full living color.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Appropriation Committee's proposal was the opening act in what is likely to be a long political drama, in which the Senate will eventually have a say. The measure is expected to be approved Thursday by the subcommittee in charge of NASA and the other agencies, according to Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wednesday the full Appropriations Committee will meet again to consider the final bill.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- As the scheduled launching of the final space shuttle approached, Tom and Jo Foley were having a dispute about the future of Space World U.S.A., the mom-and-pop souvenir shop they have run since 1968. He believes they should retire; she wants to stay open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may sell,'' said Mr. Foley, 82, whose trinket-crammed NASA memorabilia shop is Florida's oldest. ''We just don't want to give people the impression the store is giving up on the space program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, we'll never sell the shop,'' Mrs. Foley, who does not tell her age, playfully retorted. ''He would just curl up and die without it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So go conversations up and down the Space Coast, where aeronautics are as culturally ingrained as sandy beaches and surfboard shops. Everyone feels the impact of the shuttle program's ending after 30 years and 135 flights, and questions about the area's future far outnumber answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttles have launched here, on average, every three months since 1981 -- a ritual that is expected to draw up to a million people on Friday at 11:26 a.m. when, weather permitting, the Atlantis is scheduled to take its final flight. (NASA says there is a 70 percent chance the launching will be delayed by rainy weather.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kennedy Space Center employs 13,000 people, and many thousands more work for aerospace contractors. Then there are businesses like the Foleys' -- on the order of NASA-themed restaurants and surfboard shops that take spectators on the water to watch the launchings -- that are bolstered by a regular tide of shuttle tourists. All of this in a county with 10.8 percent unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest focus economically is going to be keeping these talented, highly educated people in the area,'' said Bill Moore, the chief operating officer of the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex. ''We all have friends or husbands or brothers at the space center, and they're looking for work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space center contractors have already announced 7,000 layoffs this year. And local officials worry about declining tourism as baby boomers age and memories of the golden age of space travel fade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marsha Getkey, the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Titusville, a city where many space center workers live, said it felt a little like the closing of a town's main factory. ''When a shuttle launch happens, people here don't just hear a rumble and look up,'' she said. ''You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't know the launch time and land time. It's that much a part of the community's fabric.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has created an atmosphere both nostalgic and celebratory around the space center, where visitors were already gathering Thursday to watch ''Star Trek'' movies, buy memorabilia and stake out viewing spots. Tickets to watch the launching from the best locations were selling for up to $1,200 online, as much as Super Bowl tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're here to watch history, but we're also here to watch something become history,'' said Steve Allen, 64, an engineer from Colorado Springs who brought his family of five, all outfitted in blue NASA shirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space center is expecting its largest crowd for a launching, despite the rain. Many tourists said they had dreamed of attending a NASA launching since the cold war, and splurged on the last opportunity of this kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I bought a one-way ticket from South Korea,'' said Michael Kim, 57, an engineer. ''If it rains, I will just wait. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. I'm staying put.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert E. Hunter, a historian from Chicago, persuaded his wife, Nancy Grim Hunter, to attend what he called a ''once-in-a-lifetime'' event: a trip that cost each of them about $1,000, including travel, rental car and souvenirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of times America gets criticized for what it does in the world,'' he said. ''But you think about the space program. It's something that doesn't hurt anyone, isn't imperialistic and is almost universally uplifting and inspiring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Wyles, 70, a retired <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> employee who lives near the center, has watched every launching since 1981. She has a routine -- sitting in her backyard with her grandchildren and her Chihuahua, Mojo, and counting down from 10 to zero -- that she will follow again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to look the same,'' she said. ''But the feelings are going to be so much different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore said that only 5 percent of those who toured the visitors complex came for shuttle launching. But he said the space center planned to create new attractions involving unmanned and private space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The NASA story is not clear right now. It's still being written,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But even in this tumultuous time, it's going to be an historic weekend.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- For the last time, the engines of a space shuttle roared, the ground rumbled, and the shuttle Atlantis rose off the launching pad and disappeared into the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By dawn Friday, cars and Winnebagos lined the sides of roadways with prime views as hundreds of thousands of people came to watch the 135th flight in the space shuttle program. The program, which began in 1981, comes to an end when the Atlantis' wheels roll to a stop on the runway in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to NASA, the luminaries who came included Joe Gibbs, the former Washington Redskins football coach; Steve Wozniak, co-founder of <span class="companylink">Apple Computer</span>; and the singer Jimmy Buffett. So did 14 members of Congress; John Holdren, the president's science adviser; Eric Holder, the United States attorney general; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and two former NASA administrators, Daniel Goldin and Michael Griffin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Robert L. Crippen, a retired Navy captain who was the pilot of the first shuttle flight, came to watch the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last shuttle flight also contained a piece of the first flight. The shuttle's solid rocket boosters are recovered and refurbished, and the top segment of the left booster that helped lift the Atlantis off the ground on Friday first flew on the first flight, on April 12, 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis is carrying 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With storms rumbling around the area, forecasts had given just a 30 percent chance of favorable weather for the launching of the Atlantis. ''We had a decent shot at it,'' Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, said, explaining the decision early Friday to begin pumping more than half a million gallons of rocket fuel into the external fuel tank despite the uncertain forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rain stayed away, the clouds thinned, and the countdown, which encountered no significant setbacks, continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Good luck, Godspeed and have a little fun up there,'' Mr. Leinbach said to the crew after his team gave the go-ahead for the final few minutes of countdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commander of Atlantis, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, thanked Mr. Leinbach and the launching team. Noting the end of the shuttle era, he added: ''The shuttle is always going to be a reflection of what a great nation can do when it dares to be bold and commits to follow through. We're not ending the journey today, Mike, we're completing a chapter in a journey that will never end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 31 seconds before the scheduled liftoff, the countdown clock halted. An electronic signal indicated that the ''beanie cap'' that vents oxygen gas from the external fuel tank had failed to retract. But by looking at video images, mission controllers confirmed that the arm had indeed fully retracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 11:29 a.m. -- two and a half minutes later than scheduled -- the engines of the Atlantis ignited to propel it to orbit with its crew of four: Capt. Ferguson; Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the Marines; Sandra H. Magnus; and Rex J. Walheim, a retired Air Force colonel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a minute, the shuttle, leaving behind a thick plume of smoke, disappeared into the clouds. Although the spacecraft was out of sight, the still-rising plume cast a shadow onto the clouds to mark its trajectory to space, and the Atlantis reached orbit in eight and a half minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts will spend Saturday inspecting the heat shield and are to dock at the space station on Sunday. The mission is scheduled to last 12 days, with Atlantis returning to Earth on July 20, but NASA officials hope to stretch out the last flight one additional day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a post-launching news conference, NASA officials repeated assertions that the end of the space shuttle program does not mean the end of human spaceflight and that American astronauts will continue to travel to the International Space Station, albeit on Russian rockets for at least several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't do something else, you can't do something better, unless you go through change,'' said Robert D. Cabana, director of the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Atlantis had reached orbit and their job was done, members of the launching team lingered in the control room, Mr. Leinbach said. ''It seemed we didn't want to leave,'' he said. ''It was like the end of a party, and you just don't want to go. You just want to hang around a little bit longer and relish our friends and what we've accomplished.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- There was a time, some of us remember, when a countdown at Canaveral stopped the world in its tracks. On television or at the launching, every breath was held at liftoff and every eye followed the fiery plume of ascent, up and away. Godspeed, said someone who was everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a half century ago, when men first squeezed into their machines and, defying gravity, rode into a new dimension of human experience. Unbound to Earth, our species could imagine that an age of spacefaring was truly under way, the Moon and Mars within reach, maybe even an asteroid where the Little Prince awaited our visit. The promised new reality legitimized fantasies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atmosphere here on Friday at the launching of the space shuttleAtlantis was, in some respects, reminiscent of the old days. The crowd was the largest in years, attracted by the last chance for no telling how long to see astronauts in this country leave for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything was class-reunion festive. The gray-hairs recharged memories from youth. Their grandchildren trooped along to see what had turned people on when there were just a few channels of black-and-white TV and the only telephone in the house was at the end of a cord -- and the only ones twittering were sparrows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rain clouds hovered ominously and the countdown began to the 135th departure in the 30-year-old shuttle program, the milling crowd grew still and anxious. There was concern for the four lives in the winged space plane, of course, and all eyes searched for the break in the clouds that finally came. But this time, more than ever, spectators and others who care about NASA worried for nothing less than the future of human spaceflight in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've come full circle since 1961, back to when we had yet to show we could launch people into space,'' said Steven J. Dick, a retired NASA chief historian. ''We will be hitching rides from the Russians to go to the space station that is mainly ours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony of having to send our astronauts up in Russian Soyuz capsules is as plain as cold war history. The Soviet Union's early dominance of space, manifested by the Sputnik surprise in 1957 and subsequent feats, prompted the United States to match and then surpass the Soviets in a program topped off by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Human spaceflight would have come along anyway, but not with quite the urgency of the Soviet-American competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreseeing the end of shuttle flights, the Obama administration and NASA last year proposed new plans, approved by Congress, to develop heavy-lift rockets for sending people deeper into space, to be ready perhaps after 2020. Meanwhile, NASA has begun financing research for intermediate crew-only spacecraft to be produced and launched by commercial companies, probably no sooner than 2016. Such plans, of course, are at the mercy of the budget cutting and government downsizing spreading in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori B. Garver, the deputy administrator of NASA, insisted this week that the future was bright for human spaceflight. ''We are tapping into how we developed almost everything great in this country, through commercial enterprise and competition,'' Ms. Garver said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other NASA officials noted that Congressional support for the new programs was bipartisan. But they acknowledged that budget cuts were possible, and would ultimately take a toll on launching capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, a space policy expert and the author of ''John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon,'' said there had been gaps in human flight before, especially after Apollo flights ended in 1975 and the first shuttles flew in 1981. ''We can accept that as long as a replacement is in the pipeline,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''But we are ending programs with no sure follow-ons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dick, the historian, questioned whether the barely started new programs would be ready to boost this country's astronauts into orbit in this decade. ''We're stuck in the short term, can't rouse ourselves to do much that's inspiring,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever happened to the space age as imagined back in the 1950s and early '60s, when science fiction writers and rocket scientists spun tales of travel out in the solar system and beyond? Propellants, oxygen and other good stuff never seemed limited, or radiation a risk, or Congressional budgets a curse. This alternate universe appealed to some in a society flush with confidence after winning the Second World War but feeling a bit confined in the postwar gray-flannel conformity. Americans seemed to have lost none of their can-do spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one disputes that the space age is here to stay. Think of how much our day-to-day lives depend on the herds of satellites occupying orbital space, the world community's commons. They are integral to communications, social media, business transactions, military operations and surveillance, surveys for charting world resources and climate and the G.P.S. devices that help us keep track of ourselves and others. As an inspiring bonus, other robotic instruments have extended human curiosity to the very edge of the solar system and out to the galaxies, close to cosmic beginnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does not assuage the lingering disappointment of some of those who grew up with the space age, the countdowns, the Moon walks, the unpiloted encounters with other planetary worlds and the touchdowns on the russet plains of Mars. For various reasons, the spread of no-can-do limits has swept aside the optimism with which Americans met the initial challenges of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apollo lunar-landing successes, restoring national pride and asserting pre-eminence in space technology, reduced the immediate geopolitical pressures driving human space efforts. The Nixon administration rejected NASA's post-Apollo plans for permanent Moon bases, orbiting space stations and flights to Mars. Flying reusable space shuttles was NASA's consolation prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the vehicles had their triumphs servicing the Hubble Space Telescope and assembling the International Space Station, they never came close to living up to the extravagant promise to make spaceflight more efficient and economical, approaching the reliability of aviation. The Challenger and Columbia disasters set back the program, which never approached an early objective to fly every few weeks at a cost of only $7 million (it was more like $1.5 billion a mission).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles consigned American astronauts to low orbits, going round and round, unable to strike out to distant destinations. Spaceflight dropped off the front pages -- though on Saturday, all will report the successful launching of the Atlantis, at 11:29 a.m. Eastern time Friday, two and a half minutes behind schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies of the effects of long-duration space travel by Russian and American scientists have introduced cautionary notes tempering the early enthusiasm for astronaut trips to Mars lasting several years. M. G. Lord , the author of a memoir, ''Astro Turf,'' on growing up in the aerospace culture in California, suggested that these findings contributed to a growing awareness that our bodies are far more fragile than science fiction writers thought when they concocted wide-ranging colonization scenarios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These days my pet fantasy for exploring the universe has to do with downloading human consciousness to machines -- silicon is more resilient than flesh,'' Ms. Lord said, her imagination by no means grounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty-one years after the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 707 was rolled out as the first commercially successful jet airliner, as Howard E. McCurdy, a historian at American University and author of ''Space and the American Imagination,'' pointed out the other day. He was acknowledging that aviation offered no guidance for how space travel was likely to unfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimistic Dr. McCurdy noted that private entrepreneurs continued to invest in space technology and transport systems and that ''other nations clamor to join the spacefaring club.'' The persistence of this vision in the face of adversity, he said, suggests that space travel reflects ''an elemental need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Atlantis lifted off on Friday, NASA replayed photography of the ignition and ascent over and over, from all angles, as if to hold on a little longer to this last parting of a space vehicle whose time had passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other images, of the vapors drifting away and exposing the now-empty Launching Pad 39-A, evoked the sadness and uncertainty of what is left behind at the end of an era.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many of the stories that temporarily unite the United States are tragic, even cataclysmic. Shooting sprees. Trial verdicts. Bombings. Acts of God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are those awe-inspiring acts of man, the launchings of space shuttles -- or there were, until Friday, when the final flight erupted from the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center. Television networks interrupted their daytime shows and peered skyward for the liftoff, proving one final time that the medium that came of age during the Apollo missions played a pivotal role in explaining and exciting the American people about space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the reporters and broadcasters who had witnessed dozens of other launchings sounded spellbound by the liftoff on Friday. ''You feel as though they are kind of like ripping a hole in the sky,'' the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper said from his makeshift studio near the site as he and his colleagues were blinded by the light of the solid rocket boosters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to imagine a better made-for-television uplifting event,'' said Miles O'Brien, the science correspondent for the ''PBS NewsHour,'' who grew up watching the Apollo missions to the moon on television. In an interview after the launching, Mr. O'Brien said of NASA missions, ''They offer spectacle, adventure, danger, excitement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades NASA supplied the breathtaking pictures and television networks provided the breathless anchors, giving rise to charges that news organizations were cheerleaders for the space program. ''Using the media has enabled NASA to reach a large audience at little cost,'' Mark E. Byrnes observed in the 1994 book ''Politics and Space: Image Making by NASA.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet that audience dwindled quickly after the first flight in 1981 as the missions turned routine, or at least seemed that way to the television executives who decided to stop showing live liftoffs. ''It got blase,'' said Jay Barbree of NBC, who covered every manned space mission. ''And then Challenger happened.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNN, then five years old, was the only television outlet to show the explosion that destroyed the Challenger as it happened in 1986. The image of the explosion remains dominant in the minds of Americans, asserted Mr. O'Brien, a former CNN correspondent. ''In some respects, television brought to America the limits of technology in space, in the form of the shuttle,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That tragedy, and the break-up of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, led to brief spikes in television coverage of the NASA program and its subsequent flights into space, but the program faded from the imaginations of ordinary people -- in part because there was little interest in it inside television news offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was difficult over the years to ''sell'' space shuttle coverage, the longtime CNN correspondent John Zarrella said. He partly blamed NASA. The administration ''has never done a very good job of promoting the space shuttle program or promoting itself,'' he said Thursday in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recalled visiting a NASA archive and seeing a stunning high-definition video segment of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. He said, ''We went, 'Wow, where's all this stuff been?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zarrella asked, ''Would there have been more national support for the shuttle program, for NASA, and would there have been more public outcry about the end of the shuttle program if NASA had done a better job promoting itself? I don't know the answer to that, but it's worth asking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Brien, similarly, said he had ''beaten my head against the wall for 20 years on this issue.'' On top of science phobia among some newsroom bosses, he said, NASA was not savvy enough about giving access to astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They,'' he said, referring to NASA, ''protected the astronauts way too much in an era when they should have been pushing them out'' to the news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, countless Americans found themselves attuned at one time or another to NASA TV, a bare-bones cable channel with raw coverage of missions, or to the Twitter accounts for individual astronauts. The broadcasts, particularly early on, also motivated young people to pursue science and engineering positions in untold ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The inspiration of dreams among aspiring engineers can't be calculated in TV ratings,'' Joshua King, a longtime shuttle-watcher, wrote in an e-mail. Mr. King, now the head of marketing and communications at Willis, the global insurance broker, said the coverage did not make him an engineer, but did make him ''a person who tries to think like one.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was two weeks before the liftoff of the Apollo 11 mission when Thomas Moser's boss walked into his office at NASA and announced, ''We're putting a flag on the moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moser, then a 30-year-old mechanical engineer, was put in charge of designing a flag mechanism that could not only fit into the lunar module and survive the flight, but also make the flag appear to fly on the windless moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His solution involved two sections of a staff, a telescoping tube and a nylon flag bought at a local housing goods store (Sears, he thinks). But in order for the flag to fit the staff, its edges needed to be trimmed. ''They were throwing it all in the trash,'' Mr. Moser recalled of the remnants in a recent interview, ''so I picked it up out of the trash can, mounted it and had Neil Armstrong sign it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-two years later, Mr. Moser is auctioning off those flag remnants. The expected selling price: $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's so much attention on the manned space program right now that the timing may be good,'' Mr. Moser said, referring to the final launching of the space shuttleAtlantis on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moser's flag shreds are the star lot of an extensive space memorabilia auction being held in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Sunday. Other notable items include the astronaut Deke Slayton's handwritten training notes from the Mercury program and dozens of heat shields, crew patches and other ephemera that once transcended earthly bounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For collectors, the remnants of the space flag are ''comparable to a Betsy Ross flag or the flag flying over the port in Baltimore in 1812,'' said Michael Orenstein, who is overseeing the auction for Goldberg Coins and Collectibles. Two days before the auction, online pre-bidding for the lot had reached $49,999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But trading in space nostalgia can be a dangerous business. In June, investigators confiscated a triangular nub of transparent tape an eighth of an inch wide from an auction house in St. Louis because it contained tiny particles of moon dust. Selling moon rocks, no matter how small, is illegal, as is selling NASA property that the agency has not willingly disposed of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Orenstein said that his auction contained no moon particles, and that all NASA property in the sale had been discarded by the agency long ago. A NASA spokesman declined to comment on the status of the items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also economic concerns. The collectibles market tends to follow the overall economy; when money is tight, even avid collectors are less likely to spend money on memorabilia. But Mr. Orenstein said he believed that rule did not apply to one-of-a-kind items like the flag remnants. ''Just give me two flag collectors who can't live without it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Moser, he does not plan to attend the auction, but he was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday to watch the Atlantis lift off. ''I spent most of my life developing the shuttle,'' said Mr. Moser, who retired from NASA in 1989 after 25 years with the agency. ''I was there from sketch pad to launch pad.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the space shuttle carries out its final mission to the space station orbiting 220 miles above the globe, NASA's plan to conduct far more important research from a telescope that would be perched almost a million miles from Earth is in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The James Webb Space Telescope is running way over budget, is way behind schedule and is draining money from other important space science programs. There is no easy solution to this budgetary problem, but it would be premature to terminate the program, as a House Appropriations subcommittee voted to do last week, without taking a much deeper look at whether this immensely important research platform can be saved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope is the planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has revolutionized astronomy over the past two decades, discovered hundreds of proto-galaxies, and helped establish the age and expansion rate of the universe. The more powerful Webb telescope is designed to detect even more distant objects and stars being formed even further back in time. The National Academy of Sciences ranked it the highest-priority astronomy research project to be started in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When NASA committed to the project in 2008, the Webb was expected to cost $5 billion and be launched in 2014. The expected costs have since soared to $6.5 billion, with the earliest launching date delayed to 2018 if annual funding is increased, and even later if it is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Webb's cutting-edge technologies cost more than early estimates, its technical development is going well. The problem, a review panel concluded last November, is that an unreasonably low budget and poor management by NASA forced the program to keep deferring work to subsequent years, which drives up costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delays now threaten to gobble up money that would otherwise be spent on other research projects in the coming decade, like a $1.6 billion satellite telescope that would investigate the mysterious ''dark energy'' that may be accelerating the universe's expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of killing the Webb project, Congress should let NASA accelerate testing to determine whether the complicated instrument is likely to work as expected; most repairs in space would be impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics should remember that the Hubble telescope also experienced technical difficulties, cost overruns and a mistake by a manufacturer that created a devastating optical problem until a shuttle crew could repair it. Yet in the end, the Hubble offered a rich scientific payoff. The Webb's scientific payoff could be even richer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it is known that a supernova, the violent explosion of a star, is one source of cosmic dust, the origin of the large amounts of dust needed to form planets and stars like the Sun has long been unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the aid of the European Space Agency's powerful Herschel Space Observatory, astronomers have been able to detect massive amounts of cosmic dust emitted from a supernova that became visible almost 25 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking at the sky at wavelengths that have never been observed before,'' said Mikako Matsuura, an astronomer at University College London and the study's lead author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her colleagues report their findings in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supernova was detected in 1987 in a small galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 160,000 light-years away. It occurred when an aging star's core collapsed, creating a violent explosion visible to the naked eye from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light from the supernova highlighted a giant ring of material more than six million miles long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herschel, which was sent into orbit in 2009, was able to detect very cold dust particles in the ring. The dust in the center of the star's remains is about minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Matsuura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her team reported that the explosion generated enough cold dust to form more than 200,000 Earths. Such explosions are enough, they believe, to create the large clouds of dust seen in young galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By studying this dust using Herschel and other telescopes, the researchers hope to better understand how galaxies, including the Milky Way, are formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Planets are made from interstellar dust, and so are all creatures on planets,'' said Michael Barlow, another astronomer at University College London and a co-author of the study. ''We are made of interstellar dust, ultimately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online Correction: July 11, 2011, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the agency overseeing the Herschel Space Observatory. It is the European Space Agency, not the European Space Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 13, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A report on Tuesday in the Observatory column about huge quantities of cosmic dust detected in a constellation known as the Large Magellanic Cloud described incorrectly the history of the supernova that emitted the dust. Although it first became visible from Earth in 1987, the supernova occurred about 160,000 years before; it did not occur in 1987.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Philip Scott Andrews was born, the space shuttle program was six years old, in full swing and easy to take for granted. Yet Philip has always been fascinated with space travel. You could say he was born into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His father, Scott Andrews, a photographer and technical consultant to Canon, has been covering NASA since Project Gemini in the mid-1960s and has photographed 133 of the 135 shuttle missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the end of the program was announced, we knew we had a limited time to do something special," Philip said. What they did - "Go to Launch," an extended time-lapse video showing the mind-boggling scale of flight preparation - is indeed special. But their work scarcely stopped there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip also used a camera loaded with black-and-white film to create "Last Days (in Progress)," an unusually intimate glimpse behind the scenes as the shuttle program geared up for the last mission. These pictures are classic examples of diligent documentary practice, combining persistence, patience and artistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To say nothing of ingenuity. Given the great distance that separates photographers from the launching pad, the only way to get close is to use remote cameras. "A lot of people don't realize the amount of work that goes into making an image of the shuttle lifting off the pad," Philip said. "It takes about three to four days to get all the cameras together, hooked up to their triggering devices and deployed into the field."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such great distances between photographers and cameras, common radio transmitters cannot be used to trigger the shutter. Years ago, Scott Andrews developed a device that uses the sound of the rockets' ignition to trigger the camera shutters. Each trigger can be connected to multiple cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all the uncertainty around America's future space travel after the shuttle, Philip can be sure of one thing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berkeley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH the final space shuttle mission scheduled to end this morning when Atlantis glides to earth, and with only uncertainty to follow for NASA's manned spaceflight program, this may seem like the moment to weep for the lost promise of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not. I have shed tears of wonder and awe at the scale and achievement of NASA's manned spaceflight program, but not for its inexorable end. The close of this phase of space exploration is long overdue. And what appears to be an epic conclusion is, like much of NASA's history, an elegant mirage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005 and 2006, I regularly took a long, slow bus ride from the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., where I was a research fellow, to the warehouse where the Smithsonian stores its Apollo spacesuits. Dry-cleaned by NASA after their return to earth and meticulously preserved since, the suits remain stained, indelibly, with gray-black moon dust. Their surface, a wrinkled study in chiaroscuro, seems alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, as I rode back to Washington, I saw the full moon rise into view. Preoccupied with earthly concerns, I was startled to tears by the vertigo of having spent the day with those moon-stained spacesuits, objects in human shape that had touched heaven and returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mine were not the shining tears of Walter Cronkite, unforgettably captured on television on July 20, 1969, as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon. But he and I must have felt that same marvelous mixture of delight and awe, terror and relief, at the scale of human achievement and the shift in history that hinged on a footstep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We easily forget, however, that the heroic venture had one essential justification: life-and-death geopolitics. In the hot center of the cold war, statecraft was also space-borne stagecraft. After the Soviet Union launched Yuri Gagarin into outer space in 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson: ''Is there any other space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win?'' Johnson's advisers in recommending a moon landing included not only scientists but also Frank Stanton, the president of CBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Props and costumes mattered in this theater of war. That NASA's equipment should be painted white, and feature no military shields or corporate brands but only ''USA,'' ''NASA'' and the flag, was a deliberate decision by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Yet American rockets were nevertheless cobbled together from instruments of war, their craftsmen drawn from the same network of systems engineers that was devised to manage the arms race and its doomsday scenarios. Our first astronauts went to space hunched into an improvised capsule atop ICBM's, squatting in place of warheads. The brilliance with which the resulting achievements shone was -- like a diamond's -- the result of terrible pressure. We should be glad that this era is past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the dazzling image of midcentury spaceflight obscures its dark origins, close scrutiny of the Apollo spacesuit reveals a different and more robust approach to innovation -- one that should inspire us at this uncertain moment in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the Apollo program, the conventional wisdom was that the spacesuits would be like the rockets: adamantine, metallic, armored and smooth. But repeatedly, prototypes of such suits failed under pressure. In the end, the Apollo spacesuit was made in a more unassuming fashion: needle-sewn by seamstresses taken from the shop floor of Playtex, the bra and girdle company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit was stitched together from 21 layers of different materials as varied as Teflon and Lycra. Each solved a specific problem -- from durability (the white fiberglass exterior) to restraining the balloonlike pressure bladder against the astronaut's body (brassiere-grade nylon). The suit was a literal patchwork of improvisations and adaptations, the kind of invention that typically takes place in the garage, not the lab. Indeed, the suit's head engineer, Leonard Sheperd, was a former television repairman from Queens who was recruited to Playtex after he artfully fixed the television set of the company's founder, Abram Spanel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of this ''soft'' approach -- ad hoc, individualistic, pragmatic -- should be a lesson to us. The institutional culture and mismanaged expectations of the space shuttle program have contributed, not once but twice, to the destruction of craft and crew. It was not a mere faulty O-ring or insulation fragment that threatened the Challenger and Columbia; it was, as the presidential commission that investigated the Challenger disaster concluded, a tragic disconnect between NASA's bureaucracy and the real-world complexities of engineering for space. ''For a successful technology,'' the physicist Richard Feynman wrote in his appendix to the commission's report, ''reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the shuttle's extraordinary achievements, it came to illustrate how ill-suited the military-industrial enterprise is to the only enduring rationales for manned spaceflight: heroism, pure delight and the essential expansion of human possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As entrepreneurial endeavors like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Virgin Galactic arise to fill our new gap in manned spacecraft, we have reason to be optimistic. In the same farewell address in which he cautioned against the undue influence of ''the military-industrial complex,'' Eisenhower also issued a second, less-remembered warning, against the related prospect of a world in which a ''government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such curiosity and its astonishing consequences, as exemplified by the Apollo spacesuit, is likely to flourish more richly outside the organizational constraints and corporate shell of post-Apollo NASA. And so will continue to inspire us all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last space shuttle flight rolled to a stop just before 6 a.m. on Thursday, closing an era in the nation's space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mission complete, Houston,'' said Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, commander of the shuttle Atlantis for the last flight. ''After serving the world for over 30 years, the space shuttle has earned its place in history, and it's come to a final stop.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing, the 19th before daylight at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, concluded the 135th shuttle mission. For the Atlantis, the final tally of its 26-year career was 33 missions, accumulating just under 126 million miles during 307 days in space and circumnavigating the Earth 4,848 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers used spray paint to mark the position of the Atlantis's wheels; a permanent marker will be placed on the runway to indicate the final resting spot of the space shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last day in space went smoothly. At 4:49 a.m., the Atlantis fired its maneuvering engines to slow down and begin its fall back into Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Descending in a northeast trajectory, it passed over the southeast Pacific Ocean and crossed Central America toward Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the International Space Station, Michael Fossum, a NASA astronaut, floated in the station's windowed cupola and observed the trail of hot plasma that marked Atlantis's re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than 10 minutes before landing, Captain Ferguson described the view from his window. ''Beautiful view of the Yucatan, I think, going right under the wing right now,'' he said. ''It's a gorgeous thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're looking good to us, Atlantis,'' responded Barry E. Wilmore, an astronaut at mission control in Houston. But he added a correction: ''You're just passing the west coast of Florida.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Huh? O.K.,'' Captain Ferguson said in surprise. ''I'm further than I thought we were.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the clear, windless predawn, twin sonic booms announced the impending arrival as the Atlantis slowed to less than the speed of sound. It made a wide turn to line up with the runway, concluding the 5,284,862-mile trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its 13-day mission, the Atlantis ferried 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts to the International Space Station and brought back some pieces, including a failed pump from the space station's cooling system, which engineers want to examine more closely. With the retirement of the shuttles, NASA will no longer be able to return large pieces of equipment back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will now begin the work of transforming the Atlantis into a museum piece. It will be mounted nearby at the space center's visitor center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the landing, Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, talked about the mixed emotions of the workers and NASA officials who had gathered on the runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw grown men and grown women crying today,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''Tears of joy, to be sure, and that was just human emotions came out on the runway today. You couldn't suppress them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was pride among the shuttle workers, Mr. Leinbach said, that even as the program was shutting down, they had maintained their high standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the past three or four years, we've been concentrating on completing the job we were given to do,'' he said. ''We've done that now, successfully. We have a lot of pride in that, and no one can take that away from us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But jobs will be taken away. Although no NASA government employees have been laid off, the jobs of NASA contractors working in the shuttle program were cut deeply as the program wound down. Three years ago, 15,000 people worked at the Kennedy Space Center. As of Thursday, employment had fallen to 11,500. It is expected to drop soon to 8,200 before edging up to 10,000 in a few years as new NASA programs begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardest hit is United Space Alliance, the company that handled the maintenance of the shuttles and prepared each one for flight. It will lay off 46 percent of its 5,200 workers in the coming weeks. Nearly all of the 1,643 workers losing their jobs in Florida will be out the door on Friday, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landing,'' said Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman, ''really was a heck of a last day for them.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the last space shuttle has landed back on Earth, a new generation of space entrepreneurs would like to whip up excitement about the prospect of returning to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spurred by a $30 million purse put up by <span class="companylink">Google</span>, 29 teams have signed up for a competition to become the first private venture to land on the Moon. Most of them are unlikely to overcome the financial and technical challenges to meet the contest deadline of December 2015, but several teams think they have a good shot to win -- and to take an early lead in a race to take commercial advantage of our celestial neighbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, a flotilla of unmanned spacecraft could be headed Moonward within the next few years, with goals that range from lofty to goofy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Silicon Valley venture, Moon Express, is positioning itself as a future <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> for Moon deliveries: if you have something to send there, the company would like to take it. Moon Express was having a party on Thursday night to show off the flight capabilities of its lunar lander, based on technology it licensed from NASA, and ''to begin the next era of the private commercial race to the Moon,'' as the invitation put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the near future, the Moon Express lunar lander will be mining the Moon for precious resources that we need here on Earth,'' the invitation promised. ''Years from now, we will all remember we were there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naveen Jain, an Internet billionaire and a founder of Moon Express, says the company will spend $70 million to $100 million to try to win the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, but could recoup its investment on its first flight. He envisions selling exclusive broadcast rights for video from the Moon, as well as sponsorships, a la Nascar, for companies to put their logos on the lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, perhaps, a tie-in to reality television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wouldn't it be nice if you could have a 'Moon Idol,' just like 'American Idol?' '' suggested Mr. Jain, who previously founded <span class="companylink">Infospace</span> and Intelius. ''You take the top 10 contestants and play their voices on the Moon, record it and see who sounds the best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(There is no air on the Moon to transmit sound waves, but ''you could play it through the dust and see what it sounds like when you play it right on the surface,'' Mr. Jain said. His point was that with cheap lunar transportation, there was no predicting what might catch people's fancies.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another competitor, Astrobotic Technology, intends to sell berths on its lunar lander to space agencies and scientific institutions, which would pay $820,000 a pound to send up their experiments. The company, a spinoff from Carnegie Mellon University, is building a large craft -- much bigger than Moon Express's -- capable of carrying 240 pounds of payload (read: $200 million of cargo) and hopes to be ready to launch in December 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can make a lot of money even if we do not win the prize,'' said David Gump, president of Astrobotic, which is based in Pittsburgh. ''We will be making substantial profit on the first flight. Basically, we'll break even by selling a third of the payload.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X Prize competitors might all be beaten by landers and rovers that China, Russia and India plan to send up over the next couple of years. But those fall more in the mold of traditional, government-built science probes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA had wanted to send astronauts back to the Moon, its program was canceled last year, a victim of budget cuts and shifting priorities. But it has awarded $500,000 each to Moon Express, Astrobotic and a third competitor, Rocket City Space Pioneers, the first installments of up to $30 million that it will contribute to the X Prize efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Xenofos, manager of NASA's Innovative Lunar Demonstrations Data program, said he expected one or more teams to make it to the Moon. ''It's definitely not the technical issues that's stopping them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contestants' goals do not appear to face legal hurdles. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, bars countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from setting up shop. As for mining the Moon, it could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some orbiting spacecraft have crashed into the Moon in recent years, 35 years have passed since anything from Earth made a soft landing there. To some people, this looks like an overdue invitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's probably the biggest wealth creation opportunity in modern history,'' said Barney Pell, a former NASA computer scientist turned entrepreneur and now a co-founder of Moon Express. While Moon Express might initially make money by sending small payloads, the big fortune would come from bringing back platinum and other rare metals, Dr. Pell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Long term, the market is massive, no doubt,'' he said. ''This is not a question of if. It's a question of who and when. We hope it's us and soon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the aviation prizes that jump-started airplane technology a century ago, the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize is meant to rally technologists and entrepreneurs. It is administered by the X Prize Foundation, which handed out $10 million in 2004 to the first private team to build a spacecraft that could carry people 60 miles above the Earth's surface. (The winner, SpaceShipOne, was built by the aerospace designer Burt Rutan with backing from Paul Allen, the software magnate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Moon competition, <span class="companylink">Google</span> put up $30 million. Of that, $20 million will go to the first team to land a spacecraft on the Moon, explore 500 meters and send back high-definition video and photos. The second team will win $5 million, and the remaining $5 million will pay for bonus prizes like surviving a frigid lunar night or traveling more than 5,000 meters on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the competitors see dollar signs in the Moon. Rocket City Space Pioneers, a consortium of businesses, is using its Moon effort largely to market technology that will allow multiple payloads to share one rocket, greatly reducing launching costs. (In other words, as the lander headed for the Moon, it could drop off a few satellites in orbit.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the Moon, it's so expensive, we don't know what the market is for sure in its entirety,'' said Tim Pickens, chief propulsion engineer at Dynetics, a company in Huntsville, Ala., that is leading the Rocket City effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at Moon Express, Mr. Jain's imagination runs wild. A robot could scrawl a marriage proposal in the lunar dust, take a picture and send it to the customer's beloved back on Earth. A time capsule filled with mementos or a strand of someone's hair -- and DNA -- could be sent to the Moon, where it would persist, pristine in the airless environs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People become part of moon exploration,'' Mr. Jain said, ''and that has never been done before.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smooth landing of the shuttle Atlantis on Thursday closed an era in America's human space flight program that had triumphs and tragedies over the past three decades but was long overdue to end. The question now is whether the nation can summon the will to push hard for a far more ambitious set of manned voyages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for bold ventures is bleak. The United States is not abandoning human activities in space. American astronauts will be performing experiments on the International Space Station at least through 2020, but they will have to get there on Russian space craft. The earliest that American commercial companies could carry astronauts into nearby space might be 2015 or 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has proposed more ambitious manned missions -- using technologies yet to be developed -- to an asteroid by 2025 and the orbit of Mars by the mid-2030s. Congress is, so far, unpersuaded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tough economic times, it is fair to ask why substantial money should be spent on manned space travel, especially since unmanned probes and space telescopes have produced much richer scientific findings. The answer is that manned missions are still the prime symbol of a nation's prowess in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We support President Obama's idea to send astronauts to places never visited before. Even lesser missions would make clear that the United States is not ceding the peaceful exploration of space at a time when others, notably China, are energetically pursuing their own programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's $18 billion budget is a tiny part of some $3.7 trillion in annual federal spending. Congress ought to provide enough money to keep the United States at the forefront of both human and robotic space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles had two crowning achievements: launching and repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, whose breathtaking images have revolutionized astronomy; and assembling the space station, a prodigious engineering feat. But the shuttles never lived up to their original promise of providing cheap, frequent, safe, reliable, trips to low-Earth orbit. And they turned out to be a lot more fragile than anyone realized; two were lost in catastrophic accidents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were pleased when President Obama sought to rejuvenate the space program by calling on NASA to develop ''game-changing'' technologies to provide cheaper and faster travel deep into space. But those plans were reined in when Congress virtually dictated that NASA use existing technologies to build a new heavy-lift rocket and crew capsule needed for such voyages. Many legislators are arguing for returning to the Moon first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now House Republicans want to cut NASA's spending for all programs, both manned and unmanned, by 10 percent below the president's request, with especially troubling cuts in some of the most important research areas. The House Appropriations Committee has approved a budget that would make deep cuts in planned spending on new space technologies, scale back NASA's two highest-priority unmanned missions -- to Mars and a moon of Jupiter -- and eliminate NASA's most important new space telescope (a successor to the Hubble), which is behind schedule and overbudget. NASA certainly needs to improve its efficiency. But it makes no sense to eviscerate programs that could yield cutting-edge technologies or important scientific findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have long ago grown blase with the shuttle missions. After three decades, we suppose that isn't surprising. We still believe that this country can do exciting things in space that can inspire a new generation.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>559 words</div><div>23 July 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's next Mars rover -- the ambitious, beleaguered, delayed Mars Science Laboratory -- finally has a destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission scientists announced Friday that the rover, a nuclear-powered vehicle the size of a small S.U.V., would head to Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide depression near the Martian equator. What attracted them there is a mountain that rises upward nearly three miles at the center, making it taller, for example, than Mount Rainier outside Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing about this mountain is it's not a tall spire,'' John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist, said at a news conference at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington. ''It's a broad, low, moundlike shape. What it means is we can drive up it with a rover. So this might be the tallest mountain anywhere in the solar system that we could actually climb with a rover.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists initially identified 100 possible landing sites, which were narrowed down to four finalists. All of the four were intriguing, Dr. Grotzinger said, and getting the scientists to agree on one was like getting a group of people to decide on one flavor of ice cream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the end, we picked the one that felt best,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheduled to launch after Thanksgiving, the Mars Science Laboratory -- less formally known as Curiosity -- is to arrive on Mars the following August, landing on the flat portion of the crater. The area is covered by sediments that were probably washed there by flowing water long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the rover climbs upward during its two-year mission, it will pass different geological layers, much like those at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like reading a novel,'' said Dr. Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology, ''and we think Gale Crater is going to be a great novel about the early environmental evolution of Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the rover will look at outcrops of clays and sulfates, minerals that form in the presence of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the rover continues to operate after two years, it could keep climbing up the mountain to investigate even more rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Science Laboratory is much bigger and heavier than the last two rovers NASA sent to Mars, Spirit and Opportunity. Unlike those two, which were solar-powered, Curiosity will generate its electrical power from heat produced by 10 pounds of plutonium. That will make it less susceptible to the changing Martian seasons and to dust storms that block sunlight. And it will mean that the rover can carry more sophisticated instruments, like a laser to vaporize pieces of rocks and machinery to identify elements of the resulting smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Science Laboratory was originally scheduled for launching two years ago, but it could not meet that target because of technical problems. NASA then had to wait until the orbital positions of Mars and Earth lined up again. In the meantime, the cost of the mission, originally estimated at $1.6 billion, has continued to rise: NASA announced in June another infusion of $44 million, bringing the current cost to $2.5 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing about parallel universes -- which may be great or terrible -- is that in theory they don't collide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be an alternate reality in which Mookie Wilson's grounder does not go through Bill Buckner's legs, costing the Red Sox the 1986 World Series, but Mets fans in this one don't have to confront it. You don't have to engage with a universe in which you bought Apple stock while it was cheap, or with the wealthier, smarter you asking why you were such an idiot, but neither do you get to find out what would have happened if you had spoken to that woman at the art gallery that December night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if the alternate universes did collide? Could you encounter another version of yourself? Would you like yourself? What would you say?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Better luck next time,'' is the answer Rhoda Williams, an anguished young woman who has forsaken astrophysics for janitorial work, blurts to the man who is about to become her lover in the new film ''Another Earth,'' a meditation on guilt and redemption in crisscrossing worlds. Manohla Dargis's review in The New York Times called it ''a coming-of-adulthood story that improbably blends a plaintive drama with romantic longing and far-out science fiction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rhoda has earned her bleakness. Four years earlier, as a drunken teenager bound for M.I.T., she smashed into this same man's car, killing his wife, son and unborn child and leaving him in a coma. Drawn to him out of an urge for repentance after four years in prison but unable to confess who she is, Rhoda has entered a risky relationship, first as his housecleaner and then gradually more, with the man, John Burroughs, who was a famous composer before the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story gets its title from the discovery, on the same day as the accident, of what looks like a duplicate Earth, complete with moon and blue oceans. As this Earth gets closer and plans are made to send a space shuttle to it, Rhoda signs up on the hope that history might have gone differently there and that Burroughs's family is still alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie, directed by Mike Cahill and written by Mr. Cahill and Brit Marling, stars Ms. Marling as Rhoda and William Mapother as John Burroughs. It was first shown in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize for the best film with a science theme and a Special Jury Prize for drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Another Earth'' is not science fiction in the sense that we have to come to expect it -- there are no special effects or monsters other than the failings of human nature itself. Moreover, on one level, the science in ''Another Earth'' is silly. The sudden appearance of a duplicate Earth makes no astronomical sense and violates pretty much everything we know about gravity and about planetary orbits. Indeed, the Sloan judges debated whether there was enough science in the movie, according to Sean Carroll, a cosmologist at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the panel, before concluding that it represented a fanciful extrapolation of the idea, fashionable in physics and cosmology, of multiple universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So the movie doesn't teach you much physics, or even obey any set of coherent and plausible physical laws. But it borrows ideas from physics and uses them to launch a particular trajectory, which it then faithfully follows,'' Dr. Carroll said in an e-mail, calling the movie ''an excellent example of a certain kind of fruitful interaction between science and cinema.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple universes are all the rage these days. In quantum physics, where each throw of Heisenberg's dice can result in a different universe, they are called Many Worlds. In the reigning theory of the Big Bang there are ''pocket universes'' eternally forming and bubbling away from one another. In string theory there is a 10-dimensional ''landscape'' of an almost incalculable number of different universes, each of which is a solution to the basic string equations with different properties and perhaps even dimensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These theories solve many important problems, like why the universe we live in is fit for life -- we live where we can. But they also suggest that if you go far enough or wait long enough, everything that can happen will happen and we will run into duplicates of ourselves -- in fact an infinite number of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling, 27, and Mr. Cahill, 32, who were economics majors at Georgetown and met at a film festival there, said they didn't have cosmology or science fiction in mind when they started this film. In a joint interview on the eve of the film's premiere, Ms. Marling, fascinated by the notion of doppelgangers, said she was interested in a more ''macroscopic'' question: ''What would it be like if you could confront yourself?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The duplicate Earth, she said, appeared as a visual manifestation of this concept. They didn't know about multiple universes until someone sent them a copy of ''The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,'' by the Columbia University physicist Brian Greene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling said, ''We thought we were making this stuff up.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Cahill, who calls himself ''a hard-core science fiction geek,'' was listening to audio recordings of ''Pulp Physics,'' a history of astronomy by Richard Berendzen, a professor at American University. Entranced by his voice as well as by the grand drama of cosmic history, the filmmakers called him up and asked if he would be in the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling said, ''He understood that we were using science for poetry, for metaphor.'' In the movie he plays the role of narrator, ruminating on the radio about the meaning of the other Earth and the cosmic loneliness of humanity. ''Am I alone? We on Earth would like to know,'' he says. At another point he asks, ''Can I learn from the other me?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wisely, Mr. Cahill and Ms. Marling do not try to answer that or any of the other questions -- like whether doppelgangers will like each other -- the film raises. ''There is no wrong answer emotionally,'' Mr. Cahill said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cahill said that he considered ''Another Earth'' to be a science fiction movie despite the lack of computer graphics, heartbreaking vistas and other special effects that have come to characterize the genre. ''At heart,'' he said, ''sci-fi is a lot of ideas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling chimed in to say that the goal of science fiction is to throw up a new lens on reality and get a bit closer to what it means to be human.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes in science fiction you can get closer to the truth than if you had followed all the rules,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 3, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The ''On View'' feature on July 26, about the new film ''Another Earth,'' misstated the month the film had its debut at the Sundance Film Festival. It was January, not February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return of the space shuttle Atlantis to the Earth's atmosphere two weeks ago marked the close of NASA's 30-year space shuttle program. Retirement of this popular and very visible shuttle program further strains the already diminished agency. "Space experts say the best and brightest often head for the doors when rocket lines get marked for extinction, dampening morale and creating hidden threats," according to The Times. This is not the first time in NASA's history when the agency faced publicity troubles. Back in 1974, after the success of the Mercury and Apollo programs, but before the initiation of the Shuttle Program, NASA was convinced by the National Endowment for the Arts to participate in its "Federal Graphics Improvement Program," and do what many companies these days do to revive their image: undergo a redesign.Up until that point, NASA had been primarily using an insignia adapted by James Modarelli, the head of NASA's Lewis Research Center Reports Division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> This logo, created in 1959 and affectionately dubbed "The Meatball," relied heavily on multiple visual metaphors. According to NASA's Web site, "the sphere represents a planet, the stars represent space, the red chevron is a wing representing aeronautics (the latest design in hypersonic wings at the time the logo was developed), and then there is an orbiting spacecraft going around the wing." Although charming in its quirkiness, the meatball proved difficult to reproduce given the printing technology available at the time and the variety of applications it would need to adorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Richard Danne and Bruce Blackburn. They were hired to create, in Danne's words, "a more useful new Logotype." In a recently completed, yet to be published memoir, Danne describes the streamlined new design as "clean, progressive, could be read from a mile away, and was easy to use in all mediums." Danne and Blackburn replaced the complex meatball with a stripped-down, modernist interpretation where even the cross stroke of the A's were removed. During the first design presentation, the proposed system was met with some resistance. Danne remembers NASA's Administrator, Dr. James Fletcher, and Deputy Administrator, Dr. George Low, having the following exchange:Still, the new program was approved and implemented. Seventeen years later, despite its winning the prestigious "Award of Design Excellence" by The Presidential Design Awards, NASA scrapped the Danne and Blackburn design and re-instated "The Meatball." Danne thinks this was at least partly due to how NASA chose to introduce the new logo to its various internal agencies in the first place. He says the redesign was kept secret until letters were set out to every center director ... on their new stationery. Those loyal to the old design were offended, and a rivalry between "The Meatball" and the new design (unaffectionately dubbed "The Worm") began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that NASA finds itself in another downturn, I asked Danne if he thought NASA would commission another redesign. He didn't think that the budget would allow it, but "if they were to change image directions ... they already have one very fine design program just waiting to be launched again."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margarita Marinova, a scientist with the NASA Ames Research Center, writes from Kelly Lake in British Columbia, where she is studying microbialite formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today I'm the flight director, overseeing the submersible operations, and it's a relief to see everything go smoothly. Communications are working perfectly, and we are receiving flawless video from the sub showing the little microbialites, audio of the pilot describing the divers' setting as they see it through the large glass bubble of the submersible, and location telemetry data for the subs. The Science Backroom Team is sitting in the mission control center and watching the video stream intently. As interesting features come into view, the Capcom passes along requests to the pilot for more detailed imaging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In previous years the sub pilots were largely autonomous - with navigational help from the surface, we made most decisions on where to stop for more detailed imaging, and when to go faster, ourselves. But this year we are adding a layer of operational support to help us learn how to do human planetary exploration. The microbialites we are studying in Kelly Lake are scientifically interesting themselves and provide insight into the biology, chemistry and climate of early Earth. But by using our scientific objectives as a grounding point, we are also learning how operations should be done to best support that science, whether in a lake or on a distant planet. And with NASA's current goal of sending humans to visit an asteroid, the weightless underwater environment is a rather realistic setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week: A disease with a mind of its own, looking for the oldest forms of life on Earth, and is it a boy or a girl?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the operational aspects that we added this year is the Science Backroom Team. What happens when another 5 or 10 scientists can experience the dive with the pilot? When all of their observations and thoughts can add to your interpretations? When their questions and requests make you spend an hour at a location that you were supposed to be imaging for only 10 minutes? We didn't know if the Backroom would be helpful or if it would add so much time that we would never complete the planned flights. So today I am relieved to see the pilot and Science Backroom mesh so smoothly. The exchange is natural and all Backroom requests seamlessly fit into the pilot's flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I look at the tracking data and see that the pilots of both subs are doing great following the planned flight path. We are getting all the observations we need, and are slowly unraveling the lake's secrets. My happy reverie is broken by one of the timeliners: "Sub 6 is running 20 minutes late." Part of my role as a flight director is to make sure that the subs complete their most important tasks for the flight and are back on the barge on time. The Capcom passes along the request to the sub pilot to move a little faster. But for this flight the priority is to investigate in detail the targets of interest, even if we don't get to all targets. And the pilots make the final decisions - they are the ones with the most situational awareness and are well trained to know what's of interest (this is rather different from space shuttle and space station operations, where tasks are practiced numerous times on Earth before launching, and even bathroom breaks are scripted into the timeline).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight is almost halfway through now. In a moment of excitement and anxiousness I break with protocol and call the sub pilot myself, "Sub 6, be advised, time delay will start in three minutes." This year we are also testing what effect a 50-second communications delay (each way) has on operations, simulating what it would be like for a mission to a near-Earth asteroid as the signal takes its time traveling there and back. How does the Science Backroom ask the pilot to do more detailed imaging of a feature when the pilot may have already moved on to another location? Does it even make sense for the pilot and the Science Backroom to interact, or should the pilot be autonomous?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few minutes of frantic running around, everyone is on the same page. As the time delay starts, the same attention remains on the video and audio, but everyone is scribbling more notes. Interestingly, we've found that the interaction between the Backroom and pilot can stay quite similar: If an area warrants detailed imaging, the pilot already knows that and is still there two minutes later to take any specific requests from the Backroom. The one difference is that the Backroom needs to send its messages in packets, since team members have no awareness of what they might be interrupting when they start talking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been an amazing week of discovery, subs, testing planetary operations and science. We accomplished our flights, mapped the lake and learned a lot about planetary operations. It's our final year of operations with the subs in Kelly and Pavilion Lakes, but there are many more interesting lakes to explore out there, and we still have much to learn about the wonders on Earth and exploration of the planets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time we saw Jupiter up close, it was 16 years ago, when a probe from NASA's Galileo spacecraft took a death plunge through the cloud tops and radioed back tantalizing data that all but screamed, ''To be continued...''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now NASA is headed back to the big planet, looking for the clues to help answer pressing questions about the early days of the solar system. Because whatever was in Jupiter at the beginning -- more than 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system was formed -- is still there, scientists say, hiding in a mysterious gas giant made up of dust and gas left over by the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft named Juno (after Jupiter's wife in Roman mythology) is scheduled to lift off Friday morning from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, embarking on a five-year trip. On July 4, 2016, as determined by planetary mechanics, not American patriotism, Juno will pull into orbit around Jupiter and spend a year there, making scientific observations of gravity, magnetic fields and the wetness of the Jovian atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then scientists may learn more of the secrets of Jupiter, which has twice as much mass as the rest of the planets in the solar system combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Jupiter holds the history of the solar system,'' said Scott Bolton, director of the space science department at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in San Antonio, and the principal investigator for the Juno mission. ''If you want to understand that first step of how you went from forming a sun to forming the planets, you have to understand what went into Jupiter and how it was made.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the wait will be long, scientists are excited enough about what they learned from Galileo -- which was sent into Jupiter's atmosphere in 2003, lest it crash into one of the moons and contaminate the environment with bacteria from Earth -- that they have great expectations for Juno. The trip is costing $1.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest question is the water, because Galileo's atmospheric probe found hardly any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a missing piece that turns out to be important,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have the big picture of the origins of the solar system. A cloud of hydrogen, much like interstellar hydrogen clouds seen elsewhere in the galaxy, collapsed to form the Sun. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin, like a figure skater pulling in the arms. That produced a flattened disk of leftovers orbiting the newborn Sun, and those leftovers coalesced into the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What exactly was in those leftovers is not known, however, which is why many of the spacecraft crisscrossing the solar system are looking for pristine remnants in comets, asteroids and -- soon -- Jupiter. While scientists can explain the hydrogen and the helium, it is the smidgen of heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, iron and nitrogen that are key elements for almost everything on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Life is in the balance here,'' Dr. Bolton said, ''and the things that make us up -- that everything we're looking at, breathing, touching -- is all more or less unexplained.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few reasons that Jupiter holds particular interest for scientists. For one thing, it probably formed first, before the other planets. And its gravity is so strong that once anything got sucked into it during those formative years, it never got out again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the Galileo mission, astronomers had measurements indicating that Jupiter contained higher concentrations of heavier elements than the Sun -- a surprising finding, because both bodies were formed out of the same hydrogen cloud. But they came up with a plausible explanation: Among the solar system leftovers, they speculated, were water ice crystals. After all, hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, oxygen is third and water molecules -- two hydrogens and one oxygen -- should be common. Ice traps heavier elements, and thus the icy bits that gathered into what became Jupiter could have skewed the concentrations higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Galileo probe did measure enhanced concentrations, as expected, but not in the pattern predicted by the ice explanation. ''In fact, in that one measurement, all the theories of how planets were made were proven wrong,'' Dr. Bolton said, ''and we were like, 'Oh no, what now?' Nature threw us a curveball.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more perplexing was the paucity of water. In the post-mortem analysis, many scientists surmised that, by unlucky chance, the probe descended into a particularly hot and dry spot on Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was only an educated guess. The obvious next step would have been to send more probes beneath the cloud cover of Jupiter -- especially ones that could survive to greater depths and temperatures -- but that would have been prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno is taking a different approach. The heat of Jupiter emits microwaves, and water absorbs microwaves. By simply measuring the strength of the microwaves radiating from Jupiter, scientists will be able to figure out how much water is in the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once we get all those ingredients, we'll see if we can figure out how to bake the cake, so to speak,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make the measurements, Juno will travel along a squashed elliptical orbit, swooping to within 3,100 miles of the cloud tops. Over the course of 33 orbits during the mission, Juno will get a global view of the interior. Unlike Galileo's orbit, Juno's will pass over Jupiter's north and south poles, allowing the first close-up looks at the bright auroras there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To survive the intense radiation around Jupiter, its instruments are housed inside a titanium vault. Eventually, the radiation will destroy the electronics and the craft will be sent crashing into the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravity and magnetic field measurements could provide evidence of metallic hydrogen -- at the crushing pressures inside Jupiter, hydrogen is expected turn into a liquid metal -- and a core of heavier elements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Bolton revealed that Juno would be carrying a commemorative plaque of Galileo Galilei, the scientist who first looked at Jupiter through a telescope, as well as three aluminum Lego figures: of Galileo, Juno and Jupiter carrying his thunderbolts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Already, a gender divide seems to be developing over the desirability of being launched into space, at least in the Bordian family, who were visiting the Space Needle here the other day, staring out at the cloudy cityscape and mulling the tower's latest promotional contest -- for a suborbital spaceflight, 62 miles above the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The husband, Kelly Bordian, 43, a dentist, thinks ''there is no cooler place to go.'' The wife, Lisa Bordian, 44, prefers to stay closer to home. ''I've just started traveling the earth,'' she said. ''I don't know if I'm ready for space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern was repeated among several other men and women who were interviewed atop Seattle's most distinctive landmark, its sleek figure capped by what looks like a spaceship that just landed from Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Ron Sevart, the president of the Space Needle, who dreamed up the promotion, acknowledged a gender divide. He would love to go into space himself, he said, ''but my mother-in-law wouldn't let me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Space Needle turns 50 next year and is hoping to capitalize on, if not refurbish, its image as a symbol of the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower was built for the 1962 World's Fair, at the dawn of the space age. The ''Space Race'' sweepstakes, coming just as NASA's space shuttle program has ended, hopes to highlight the work of private companies that are picking up where NASA left off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Space Needle is partnering with Space Adventures, a private space tourism company that has arranged flights to the International Space Station for eight people who have paid for the multimillion-dollar adventure themselves; in this case, the Space Needle will cover all expenses, which officials put at $110,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sevart and others announced the contest on Aug. 1. In the first 48 hours, about 14,000 people submitted their names, through spaceneedle.com or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, officials said, and thousands more have been entering every day since. The contest closes Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sending someone into space seems a rather audacious public relations stunt, one that could carry considerable risk to the winner, not to mention the Space Needle. Mr. Sevart said the winner would sign a liability waiver. He has experience in such things, having run three major Six Flags properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Space Needle was looking for a particular type of person to carry its banner into the great beyond -- one who could articulate how going into space would enhance the narrative arc of his or her life, and, of course, reflect well on the Space Needle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just about somebody who's willing to take a risk,'' Mr. Sevart said the other day as he strolled through the crowds of tourists at the top of the Space Needle. ''It's about having a discovery persona. You want it to go to a person who says this is a big deal to them; you want this to be something that is on the path of who they are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the contest is closed, a computer will randomly select 1,000 people, who are to submit a short video about why they should be picked. A panel of judges, who have not yet been determined, will cull them for their fitness and the power of their personal stories and narrow them down to 40 finalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public will then have a chance to weigh in, ''American Idol''- style, by voting for their favorite 20. The judges then choose the winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear when the winner would lift off, but probably within a couple of years and probably from Texas, said Mary Bacarella, a spokeswoman for the Space Needle. The whole trip will take about half an hour. After the rocket reaches an altitude of 62 miles above earth, the engine shuts off and those onboard will experience zero gravity for about six minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Wright, chairman of the board of the Space Needle Corporation, whose family owns the icon, said he had challenged company officials to come up with something special to ''one-up'' its 45th anniversary, when they gave away a trip to the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thrilled with the results, Mr. Wright said he saw the trip to space as a chance to promote both Seattle and the Space Needle, which he calls ''a family heirloom.'' (His father was the original builder of the Space Needle and eventually acquired full ownership of it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If visitors to the Space Needle itself were any guide, men sounded more intrigued at the possibility of blasting off than women. Children of both genders were wild about the idea, though the age of eligibility is 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The final frontier, where no man has been before?'' Bill Skelton, 69, visiting from California, said after being asked if he wanted to go. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, he said, though he had some concern that the trip would be run privately, not by NASA. Still, he said, ''if someone gave me the chance to get in a rocket, why not?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His friend Linda West, 59, a banquet waitress also from California, had plenty of reasons why not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't even want to come up here -- I'm scared of heights,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have no interest,'' said Kimberly Brown, 23, a chef in Arkansas. ''Too many things could go wrong. I mean, space is fascinating, but someone like me isn't qualified to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her niece, Makenzie Marronie, 4, was champing at the bit. ''Yes!'' the little redhead shrieked. ''You can see the stars,'' she said. Just one thought troubled her. ''I don't know the way to outer space,'' she said, frowning, before concluding, ''I guess it's straight up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also contemplating the possibilities were Alan Moss, 60, an ophthalmologist, and Jane Moss, 63, his wife and office administrator, visiting from Worcester, Mass. They said that being in space might provide a useful perspective. For example, they said, by seeing how big the earth is, they might see that humans have ruined only a small part of it, not as much as they have feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could look down on the planet,'' Mr. Moss said. ''It would be an extraordinary experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And,'' said Mrs. Moss, ''you could see how insignificant we really are.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alpha Centauri or bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government agency that helped invent the Internet now wants to do the same for travel to the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what is perhaps the ultimate startup opportunity, Darpa, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, plans to award some lucky, ambitious and star-struck organization roughly $500,000 in seed money to begin studying what it would take -- organizationally, technically, sociologically and ethically -- to send humans to another star, a challenge of such magnitude that the study alone could take a hundred years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The awarding of that grant, on Nov. 11 -- 11/11/11 -- is planned as the culmination of a yearlong Darpa-NASA effort called the 100-Year Starship Study, which started quietly last winter and will include a three-day public symposium in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 30 on the whys and wherefores of interstellar travel. The agenda ranges far beyond rocket technology to include such topics as legal, social and economic considerations of interstellar migration, philosophical and religious concerns, where to go and -- perhaps most important -- how to inspire the public to support this very expensive vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Darpa plan has generated buzz as well as befuddlement in the labs, pubs, diners and Web sites that ring NASA centers both physically and virtually, where the dream of space travel has never died and where a few stubborn bands of scientists and engineers, fueled by science fiction dreams and prophecies, are designing spacecraft that could cross interstellar space, incubating a technology and preserving it for the day when it will be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to have a hobby, why can't it be designing an interstellar spacecraft?'' said Andreas Tziolas, who teaches at the University of Alaska and directs Project Icarus, a worldwide volunteer effort to design a spacecraft that could carry a scientific probe to a nearby star -- perhaps Alpha Centauri, 4.4 light-years from here -- in a trip that would take less than 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is what we do,'' said Louis Friedman, former executive director of the Planetary Society, in Pasadena, Calif., which bills itself as the world's largest public space organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists wonder if life, especially intelligent life, exists beyond Earth. Some day, the interstellar dreamers vow, the life out there will be us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People like Dr. Tziolas say the technology already exists or will soon exist to send instruments and perhaps even people to nearby stars, although a human flight could cost hundred of trillions of dollars. The half-million dollars Darpa will award is not enough to build a starship or even to buy a modest office in which to imagine one -- but it is enough to start serious fund-raising and, perhaps to invite ridicule from critics of government spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An actual human launching is at least a couple of centuries away and, barring the invention of Star Trek-like warp drives, could take additional centuries to complete. Whoever goes on such a journey will not be coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are plenty of reasons that humans will eventually summon the political will to make the trip, scientists say, if not for human restlessness that has taken us out of the caves and across the oceans, then to escape being wiped out when the killer asteroid appears or the Sun boils the oceans, which it will do in a couple of billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another lure could be the discovery of a habitable planet elsewhere, something that could happen in the next few years through the efforts of NASA's Kepler satellite and related astronomical efforts, according to Jill Tarter, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who has devoted her life to the search for extraterrestrials. ''This will get real when we have an Earth analogue as a destination,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Neyland, Darpa's director of tactical technology, is at pains to point out that the goal of his project is not an interstellar spacecraft, only a business plan for designing one. The search, he explained, is for an organization, presumably private, that can develop the interstellar vision without government help, carrying the load for the next 100 years, developing valuable technological offshoots the way investing in computer protocols enabled the Internet. (The time frame was inspired by Jules Verne, whose novel ''From the Earth to the Moon'' was published in 1865, 104 years before it came true.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After this November, whoever it is will be on their own. ''We don't intend to carry it forward,'' Mr. Neyland added. ''Darpa hands the keys over to this entity, and we wish them well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interstellar travel is a tall order. It would take Voyager 1, humanity's fastest artifact, now traveling 38,000 miles an hour relative to the Sun, more than 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri, if it were headed in that direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a group of physicists led by Theodore Taylor of <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> and Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study proposed propelling a ship by the pressure waves from atomic bombs dropped one after another out of the back, every three seconds. Such a spacecraft, they calculated, could reach Jupiter in a year but would take hundreds of years to reach Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Interplanetary Society used a more benign form for this propulsion idea in its interstellar spaceship study, Project Daedalus, in the 1970s. Their spacecraft would be powered by tiny thermonuclear explosions caused by compressing pellets of deuterium and helium-3 with laser blasts. It would carry a 500-ton scientific probe to Barnard's Star, 5.9 light-years away, in about 50 years, reaching a top speed of 12 percent of the speed of light along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tziolas said, ''That was the very first study that proved it's possible with knowledge we have now to travel to another star.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, other virtual collaborations have joined the party. The Tau Zero Foundation, based in Cleveland, was founded by Marc G. Millis, who directed propulsion research at the NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, to encourage work on ''practical interstellar flight.'' Last year Mr. Millis calculated that it would be at least 200 years before society had the energy resources to send 500 people out of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A variety of propulsion schemes have their fans and might prevail the long span between now and launch day -- a problem that Mr. Millis terms ''incessant obsolescence.'' Among them are gigantic sails pushed by sunlight or by powerful microwave beams and ion drives in which beams of high energy particles do the propelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientific probes could go sooner and cheaper. Professor Dyson recently pointed out that soon all the genetic information needed to reconstruct Earth's biosphere could be packed into something the size of an egg. Dispersed through space to different planets, such eggs could create homes-away-from-home waiting for us. ''The new technology will be biological,'' he said. ''It will make everything else obsolete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Mr. Neyland and Pete Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, quietly invited about 30 scientists, entrepreneurs and science fiction writers to a two-day brainstorming session in northern California. Mr. Neyland described the first meeting as an attempt to get past ''the giggle factor'' associated with the subject. Participants included scientists like J. Craig Venter of the J. Craig Venter Institute, who was one of the first to sequence the human genome, and writers like Joe Haldeman, author of the award-winning novel, ''The Forever War.'' One participant said, ''There were a few people on the other side of reality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, nobody is smart enough now to know what could come of the starship effort, Mr. Neyland pointed out. It would be naive to think we even know the right questions to ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you had asked Einstein and Marconi in 1910 to define a worldwide communication system for the common man,'' Mr. Neyland asked, ''would he have come up with the iPhone?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A call for ideas for the Orlando meeting drew hundreds of responses, which are being sorted to decide who will get to speak. Dr. Tarter, the astronomer at SETI, will coordinate talks on where to go. She has received 50 or 60 proposals, which she called a ''mixed bag,'' some of which read like U.F.O. reports. ''Maybe,'' she said, ''you have to be a little bit crazy to think about this seriously.'' She added, ''We've all read enough science fiction to be fundamentally optimistic about the possible outcome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin Long, a physics graduate student at Warwick University and member of Project Icarus, said he had already thought about the floor plans, an organization chart and even a Japanese garden in the backyard for a pyramidal Interstellar Institute, where the research for an interstellar trip could eventually be centered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of us are quite young. We grew up hearing about the Apollo program,'' he said. ''We want to be part of a significant journey. We personally think we may be doing something important, driving humanity out to the stars.'' He quoted Arthur C. Clarke, the late writer of science fact and fiction who invented the idea of communications satellites and helped found the British Interplanetary Society: ''If you believe something is possible, you can make it happen.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANDREW E. KRAMER and KENNETH CHANG; Andrew E.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian cargo rocket ferrying three tons of food and fuel to the International Space Station broke down about five minutes after it blasted off on Wednesday, completing its flight by arcing into a Siberian forest rather than achieving orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash of the unmanned craft, a Progress cargo ship on top of a Soyuz rocket, does not pose an immediate problem for the six crew members living at the space station, who are well stocked with supplies taken there in July by NASA's last shuttle flight. But it raises questions about the reliability of this model of Russian rocket, a similar model of which is used for manned launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the retirement of the shuttle program last month, Russian-made Soyuz rockets are the only means of transport to space for American astronauts. NASA has contracted with the Russian Space Agency to fly Americans on these rockets for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash on Wednesday will surely be closely scrutinized because of its implications for American manned space flight on the Russian rockets. If a quick diagnosis and fix elude Russian engineers, NASA and the other agencies collaborating on the space station could face difficult choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've always known this was a risk,'' the manager of the space station for NASA, Michael T. Suffredini, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next set of three crew members is scheduled to launch to the space station in September, and another three are to go up in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, the Soyuz capsules in which the crew members ride also serve as lifeboats in case of an emergency, and the capsules are allowed to stay at the station for up to 210 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It means that three crew members may have to return to Earth in one of the Soyuz capsules docked at the station by October at the latest. Without replacements, that would leave only three people to operate the station, greatly reducing the time they could devote to running experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the problem dragged on to the end of the year, the other three would also have to return to Earth, leaving the space station unoccupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini said the station could be operated from the ground and stay in orbit indefinitely as long as there were no major failures and other cargo ships continued to fly; a Japanese one and a European one are scheduled to be launched next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Progress and Soyuz have proven reliable until now. Forty-three of the supply ships have successfully flown to the space station. But the failure on Wednesday was the second in August from the Baikonur launching pad in Kazakhstan. The upper stage of a Proton rocket sent a telecommunications satellite into the wrong orbit on Aug. 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia is planning another Soyuz expedition on Thursday, from the Plesetsk launching pad in the far north of European Russia. That rocket is scheduled to carry a navigation satellite for the Glonass system, the Russian version of the American GPS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Russian space agency said it might delay manned launchings on the Soyuz -- the only means of reaching the station for astronauts and cosmonauts -- if the reasons for Wednesday's crash were not quickly determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Progress is a cargo spaceship that the Russians call a space truck, routinely launched to the space station carrying spare parts, fuel, food, oxygen, water and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz design is a 1960s holdover that jettisons four bulky booster rockets soon after liftoff, then flies in three stages to space. It carries both manned and unmanned spaceships to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the launching on Wednesday, the Progress lifted off as planned on top of a Soyuz rocket. A little more than five minutes later, however, the rocket's third-stage engine shut down sooner than it should have, before the spacecraft had enough velocity to reach orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket and Progress ship crashed in the dense Siberian forest. The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said rocket debris landed in three separate areas of the Altai region in southern Siberia, which borders Mongolia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional governor, Yuri Antaradonov, said the police had cautioned people to stay clear of the wreckage, as it could be contaminated with toxic fuel. His only concern, he said, was that some people may have been camped in the forest at the time of the crash because ''it is the season of collecting pine nuts'' in that part of Siberia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- Prospects seemed to dim on Thursday for a timely launching of a Russian rocket that would carry American astronauts to the International Space Station next month, with Russian space officials temporarily grounding a similar rocket after one crashed shortly after takeoff on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the end of NASA's space shuttle program last month, American astronauts must travel into space on Russian Soyuz rockets. When one of them crashed over Siberia on Wednesday, concerns began to mount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space officials canceled the Friday launching of a Soyuz rocket that was to carry a navigation satellite for Glonass, the Russian equivalent of the American GPS system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin also ordered an overhaul of the safety procedures at the Russian space agency, according to his spokesman. The changes will affect how the agency checks rockets, satellites and space vehicles it buys from Russian manufacturers and will influence its prelaunching procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the accident on Wednesday, the rocket's third and final stage shut down for reasons not yet known before the spacecraft had entered orbit. It arced back to earth with its cargo of fuel and food, including green apples and garlic cloves eagerly awaited by the space station's crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the region of Siberia where the rocket crashed, a village doctor reported Thursday that eight people complained of high blood pressure, throat irritation and fever. He suggested that they had been exposed to toxic fuel because the symptoms occurred only after the crash, according to Interfax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They appeared after the fall of the fragments and were confirmed with instrumental diagnosis,'' the doctor, who was not named, was quoted as saying. ''We do not rule that the two things are related.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, though, also quoted Russia's chief public health official, Dr. Gennady Onishchenko, who said that tests had turned up no traces of the fuel in rivers near the crash site.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts will abandon the International Space Station, probably in mid-November, if rocket engine problems that doomed a Russian cargo ship last week are not diagnosed and fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if unoccupied, the space station can be operated by controllers on the ground indefinitely and would not be in immediate danger of falling out of orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Russian astronauts, two Americans and a Japanese are living on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to do what's the safest for the crew and for the space station, which is a very big investment of our governments,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, manager of the space station program for NASA, during a news conference on Monday. ''Our job is, as stewards of the government, to protect that investment, and that's exactly what we're going to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $100 billion station has been continuously occupied for over a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, an unmanned Russian cargo ship known as the Progress, which was carrying three tons of supplies to the space station, crashed in Siberia. Telemetry from the rocket indicated that a drop of fuel pressure led its computer to shut down the third-stage engine prematurely five and a half minutes into flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz rocket that lifts the Progress is similar to the Soyuz rocket that takes astronauts to the station, and officials want to make sure they understand what failed on last week's launching and are confident it will not occur again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two unmanned launchings of Soyuz rockets are likely to occur before the next set of three crew members head to the space station. That launching had been scheduled for Sept. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of the Progress is of little immediate impact. One of the Russian astronauts is running short of clothes and might have to borrow some from NASA, Mr. Suffredini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current crew has plenty of supplies and could remain in space longer. What expires, however, is their return trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Soyuz capsules, each with seats for three passengers, are currently docked to the space station. But the capsules are certified to last only 200 days in orbit, because hydrogen peroxide for the spacecraft's thrusters degrades over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return of the first capsule has been pushed back a week, to Sept. 15, giving NASA and the Russian space agency more time to study their options. Delaying much more than that would run into a safety rule, that the capsules land during the day. The next opportunity would be in late October, beyond the 200-day limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians could study whether the capsule's condition could allow a longer stay, but Mr. Suffredini questioned whether that would be wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you've already been handed one significant challenge, maybe you shouldn't put another one on top of it until you sort that one out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other three crew members would return in the second Soyuz capsule in mid-November. If the problem with the Soyuz rocket had not been resolved, the station would then be empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experiments like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a particle physics experiment installed in May, would continue operating without human oversight. But other research would get short shrift until the full crew of six returned to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all of the day-to-day operations can be handled remotely, mission controllers may not be able to handle emergencies that might endanger the space station. ''There is a greater risk of losing the I.S.S. when it's unmanned than if it were manned,'' Mr. Suffredini said. ''The risk increase is not insignificant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the retirement of NASA's shuttles, the Soyuz rockets will be the only way for people to go to the space station for several years at least. The Soyuz, dating to the 1960s, has been a reliable workhorse for the Russian space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 31, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the prospect of astronauts' having to abandon the International Space Station misstated the timing of the installation of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer particle physics experiment at the station.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian commission has pinpointed a clogged fuel pipe as the reason a Soyuz rocket crashed into a forest in Siberia last month before it reached orbit, but the panel offered no guidance on when this type of rocket would again be considered ready for manned missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While narrowing the cause of the accident to one part, the commission also raised broader and difficult-to-address concerns about quality control in the Russian factories that make parts for the country's manned space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirming initial reports, the commission said the first and second stages fired as planned on Aug. 24. But the third stage shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doomed rocket was carrying supplies on a Progress unmanned cargo spaceship to the International Space Station, but it was similar to the model that used to ferry cosmonauts and astronauts into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipe that clogged was a small but integral part of the third-stage engine, according to a statement by the Russian Space Agency, which said its engineers had reached this conclusion by analyzing telemetry. Despite a lengthy search with helicopters, the authorities have yet to find any debris in the dense pine forest where the rocket crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipe sent kerosene to a small turbine that was not generating thrust but, instead, providing power to pump kerosene and liquid oxygen into the main combustion chambers, according to the statement.''This disrupted the engine's operations, affected its parameters and activated the system that switched off the engine,'' the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However reassuring that finding may be for space officials in Russia and at NASA, which has rented seats on the Soyuz rocket as the only means for Americans to reach space after the retirement of the space shuttle this summer, pinpointing the cause as a manufacturing flaw is likely to increase jitters about Russian safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission shared this concern. ''The members of the commission came to the conclusion that the manufacturing defect was accidental,'' it said. ''But a decision can be taken to qualify it as a single instance only after a thorough re-evaluation'' of quality control in the entire parts supply for the third-stage engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission recommended that the space agency put into effect a better quality-control program for engine parts and offered a suggestion for the plant that made the flawed pipe: ''video surveillance of workers at the final assembly line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission ruled out errors by the ground crew that prepared the rocket. Such an error could have been fixed by changing the launching procedure, said Marina Alekseyenkova , an aerospace analyst at the large government-controlled bank <span class="companylink">Gazprombank</span>, in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A design flaw might also be quickly addressed. But the design of the engine, which has been flown successfully for years, is hardly in question, she said, while manufacturing defects could be hard to systematically eliminate, with hundreds of parts made in scattered, Soviet-era factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are talking about an assembly problem,'' she said. ''This is really a bad sign for the industry. It means that everything made should be checked and checked again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians' troubleshooting comes at a critically important time for NASA, as members of Congress and the White House are in a dispute over the scale of financing for the private spaceship ventures that are intended to replace the shuttle. Underscoring the risks of private space designs, a test craft of Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, also crashed Aug. 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unclear how long the Russians might require to carry out the new controls, like videotaping assembly workers. The statement said officials would draft a timeline for launchings, including manned missions. The Russians had said they would launch two Soyuz boosters carrying unmanned spacecraft -- a cluster of satellites and a cargo ship -- before sending up a crew including American astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Russians cannot verify the safety of the Soyuz by mid-November, Russian and American authorities have said, the International Space Station might have to be left temporarily without a crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A previous version of this article misstated when Jeff Bezos's test craft crashed. It was Aug. 24, not last week.nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European astronomers said Monday that they had found what might be the best candidate for a Goldilocks planet yet: a lump of something about 3.6 times as massive as the Earth, circling its star at the right distance for liquid water to exist on its surface -- and thus, perhaps, to host life, as we narrowly imagine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as HD 85512b, is about 36 light years from here, in the constellation Vela. It orbits its star at about a quarter of the distance that Earth circles the Sun, taking 58 days to make a year. That distance would put it in the star's so-called habitable zone, if the planet is rocky and has some semblance of an atmosphere -- ''if everything goes right and you have clouds to shelter you,'' as Lisa Kaltenegger of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, summarized it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers cautioned, however, that it would take years and observations from telescopes not yet built before those assumptions could be tested and a search for signs of life could be undertaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither humans nor their robot helpers are likely to be dispatched toward Vela anytime soon. But the finding did vault HD 85512b to the top of a list of the handful of Goldilocks candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vela planet was part of a haul of more than 50 new exoplanets -- as planets around other stars are called -- discussed in a news conference on Monday hosted by the European Southern Observatory. They are the newest fruits of an eight-year observing program by astronomers based at the University of Geneva and led by Stephane Udry and Michel Mayor, working from a telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. About 16 of them are so-called super-Earths, with masses less than 10 times the Earth, further encouraging astronomers that they are on the verge of finding planets like ours. A pair of papers -- one with Dr. Mayor as lead author and the other with Francesco Pepe, also of Geneva, as lead author -- have been submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics, describing the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Geneva astronomers used a sensitive spectrograph known as Harps (an acronym for High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) to detect wobble in the stars' motions as planets swung around them. The wobble technique, however, only reveals the masses of exoplanets. Without further information like the size -- which NASA's Kepler satellite, also in the exoplanet business, measures by seeing the shadows of planets as they cross in front of their stars -- or the composition, the astronomers cannot say for sure whether the Vela planet is made of rock, steam, iron, diamonds or something else. Nor can they tell what, if any, atmosphere it has. Kepler will be of no help because its gaze is fixed on a different swath of sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star that the Vela planet circles is known as HD 85512, or Gliese 370, after Wilhelm Gliese, a German astronomer. The star is orange, about two-thirds as massive and about an eighth as luminous as our Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study led by Dr. Kaltenegger, Dr. Pepe and Dr. Udry concluded that HD 85512b was potentially habitable if it had more than a 50 percent cloud cover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov of the Center for Astrophysics, who has followed this work but is not part of the team, said that Dr. Kaltenegger and her colleagues made reasonable assumptions. He called the result ''very solid'' and ''a major step in the right direction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were less impressed by the case for habitability. Sara Seager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted that Dr. Kaltenegger's model atmospheres were limited to water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, like the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A very terracentric view,'' she said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Seager said, ''Would I bet $1 that this is a habitable planet? No. If I had a space telescope that could look at the atmosphere, would I point to the planet? Yes.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 14, 1959, the Luna 2 space probe crashed onto the surface of the moon. Though Luna 2 was shattered on impact, the mission was a major success, as it represented an important first in the history of space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the Sept. 14 New York Times reported that the Soviet announcement of the event "said the container had made history's first flight from the earth to another cosmic body. The moon strike was an outstanding achievement of Soviet science and engineering and had opened a new page in space research."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soviets were also quick to note that they -- not the Americans -- were the first to reach the moon. As The New York Times reported, "The Soviet press and proclamations issued both at home and for abroad were quick to restate the claim of superiority for Soviet science and by extension the superiority of the Communist system that has supported it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soviets continued to enjoy an advantage in the Space Race for the next few years. In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man to enter orbit. The United States space program, NASA, eventually surpassed its Soviet counterpart when it put the first man on the moon in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2011, NASA ended its 30-year Space Shuttle program and with it, terminated any plans for space travel in the near future. NASA has hopes of launching missions toward Mars in the distant future, but it does not currently have the financing to undertake this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers of The New York Times debated the future of NASA in a Sunday Dialogue feature published shortly after the final Space Shuttle mission. Some, including an aerospace engineer, favored ambitious plans to reach Mars. Others stated that space exploration was too costly and instead called for Congress to spend money on domestic programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you think the United States should approach space exploration in the 21st century? Do you think it should continue to try to be a global leader in deep space travel, or should it focus on smaller, more cost-efficient missions? Why?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- The announcement on Tuesday by the Russian space agency that it will delay the launching of the next crew to the International Space Station is a concern for NASA, which is relying solely on the Russians for astronaut transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the space shuttle program after the last flight in July was meant to usher in a new era where NASA could move on to more ambitious destinations and nimbler, cheaper private companies would take over the job of ferrying people and supplies to the orbiting research station. But a series of recent rocket malfunctions -- including one on Aug. 24 by a Russian ship that was taking supplies to the space station -- has made this approach look tenuous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be better if the space station were not reliant on any one nation,'' said Scott Pace, director of the space policy institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American companies have contracts with NASA to carry cargo to the space station and hope eventually to win contracts to serve as space taxis for humans. But their success is hardly assured. The <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., one of two companies that are to start taking cargo to the space station next year, suffered a setback in June when an engine caught fire during a ground test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other company, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif. -- or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- has come under criticism because it did not disclose until last week a brief overheating of the engines during an otherwise highly successful test flight last December. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> aims to take its first load of cargo to the space station in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin, a space company started by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, suffered a major failure during a flight test last month of a vehicle it is designing to carry tourists to the edge of space. The crash was unrelated to its NASA-financed project but raised questions about the secretive company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was the crash of the Russian cargo ship that has had the most immediate consequences, because that rocket is similar in design to the one the Russians will use in November to carry astronauts, including one American. An investigation traced the failure to a manufacturing defect on a fuel pipe that caused the third-stage engine to shut down. The finding created concerns about quality control in the Russian rocket factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Russian space agency postponed the next manned launching to Nov. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station has a crew of six, but three will return this week on one of the two Soyuz capsules docked there. The capsules are certified to last six months in orbit. The other three crew members must leave in the remaining capsule by Nov. 19, leaving little leeway for further delays if the space station is to remain occupied. Astronauts have lived on the space station continuously for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission control on the ground can operate an empty station, but could be helpless if a malfunction sends the $100 billion station tumbling out of control and putting at risk practically the entire human spaceflight program of the United States, Russia and the other participating nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space officials said they would launch two unmanned Soyuz rockets -- one launching satellites and the other carrying cargo to the space station -- before sending up people again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA, there is no short-term solution, and space experts and policy makers hold clashing views on what the agency's long-term approach should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the American contractors, they are nowhere near ready to launch people into space and probably will not be until 2015 at the earliest. And in Washington, the White House and Congress continue to argue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration proposed $850 million for the next fiscal year to further finance commercial development of astronaut-carrying ''space taxis'' -- what NASA calls its commercial crew program -- while Congress has put a higher priority on a large NASA-designed rocket for astronaut missions beyond low-Earth orbit. A budget bill passed by the House provided only $312 million for commercial crew efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, commercial crew advocates say the Russian travails show that Congress should follow the White House's blueprint. ''If the space station goes splash, it's $100 billion down the drain,'' said John Gedmark, executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group. ''This is why it is so important that the U.S. providers get up and flying as soon as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also appears to be broadening its rocket choices. It announced on Tuesday an agreement with <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>. of Minneapolis to help with its proposed Liberty rocket. Alliant built the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttles and was working on a longer version for the first stage of Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberty closely resembles the Ares I with an almost identical first stage, but would use a European-built second stage to speed development. NASA would not pay Alliant, but about two dozen NASA employees would work full time on the project.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To push farther out into the solar system -- to the moon and beyond, to asteroids, eventually to Mars -- NASA unveiled plans on Wednesday for a behemoth rocket that would serve as the backbone of its human spaceflight program for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finished rocket would be the most powerful ever to rise from the gravitational bonds of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're investing in technologies to live and work in space, and it sets the stage for visiting asteroids and Mars,'' the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., said at a news conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The megarocket, blandly named the Space Launch System, embodies the space agency's enduring desire to aim far and dream big. But it also reflects a shrinking of near-term ambitions as budget cutters seek to rein in federal spending. Just two years ago, NASA had hoped to build an even larger rocket that would take astronauts back to the moon and set up an outpost there. With money more limited, the pace of progress will be much slower than during NASA's Apollo heyday in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Gerstenmaier, the agency's associate administrator for human exploration, said NASA expected to devote $3 billion a year to the effort, or a total of about $18 billion over the next six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be enough to finish a rocket capable of lifting 70 metric tons into orbit; the largest unmanned rockets currently available can lift about one-third that much. The first unmanned test flight is scheduled for 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design would evolve to larger versions that could lift up to 130 metric tons. (The Saturn V rocket that powered the Apollo Moon exploration program could lift 120 metric tons.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the previous program, Constellation, which set a very specific goal -- returning to the moon by 2020 -- NASA has yet to decide destinations or deadlines for what it would do with its new rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've talked conceptually about multiple destinations,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said. ''We talk about an asteroid in 2025. We talk about Mars being the ultimate destination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More details would be worked out over the next year. ''We can do pretty exciting missions with the capability that we've got,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional backers of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hailed the announcement as resolving a standoff between Congress and the White House over the agency's future. In February 2010, the Obama administration had proposed a radical shift in space exploration, canceling the Constellation program and deferring any decision on a replacement for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the administration retreated under Congressional pressure, first reviving the crew capsule from the Constellation program and now proposing a heavy-lift rocket that looks like Constellation's slimmer sibling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a day we've been looking forward to for a long time,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican. ''We wish it had been sooner, of course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, a blueprint for the space agency calling for a rocket like the one announced Wednesday. But NASA missed deadlines for announcing how it would carry out the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In frustration, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, where Senator Hutchison serves as ranking member, even issued a subpoena to NASA demanding information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unveiling of the heavy-lift rocket was a victory for Ms. Hutchison and Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the commerce committee's science and space subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas is home to NASA's Mission Control and Florida is where NASA's rockets are launched from. The two senators played key roles in writing the NASA blueprint and outlining many specifics of the rocket they wanted NASA to build, leading critics to sarcastically call it the Senate Launch System.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement took place on Capitol Hill, not NASA headquarters, and at the news conference it was Senator Nelson who spoke first for five minutes, describing the characteristics and capabilities the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, General Bolden said, ''I'm the administrator and not the expert at NASA'' and deferred technical questions to a subsequent telephone news conference that Mr. Gerstenmaier held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics note that NASA has announced ambitious rocket plans before, only to cancel them as costs escalated and schedules slipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, there will be budget cuts,'' said James Muncy, a space policy consultant. ''Yes, it will be stretched out. Yes, it will have problems. And yes, it will fall apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Constellation program, unveiled in 2005, spent more than $10 billion and flew one prototype rocket before it was canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Grunsfeld, the former astronaut who flew on several space shuttle missions to repair the Hubble Space Telescope and is now deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: ''The only good thing about the initiative is that NASA is moving on something, and that the jobs are preserved. It also means we'll have this discussion again in two years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To speed development and control costs, the design is based on pieces from the just-retired shuttles and the canceled Constellation program. The first stage is an elongated shuttle fuel tank, and it would use the same rocket engines as the shuttles. For the initial test flights, two solid rocket boosters -- stretched versions of what flew on the shuttles -- would provide additional thrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced plans for a competition to design more powerful boosters, each providing 3.9 million to 5 million pounds of thrust, for the more powerful version of the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The schedule beyond the first test flight depends on future budgets. The first rocket that is to fly in 2017 will consist of a single stage. Internal NASA documents suggest that if the space agency's budget remains flat, providing about $41 billion from 2012 through 2025, NASA will not be able to do much work on the second stage, needed to increase the lift capability, until after 2017, and the first manned flight would not occur until 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent flights would occur only once every year or two, and the final version, capable of lifting 130 metric tons, would not be completed for two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more money, perhaps as much as $62 billion over the next 14 years, the agency estimated that the first manned flight could be moved up by three years and the 130-metric-ton rocket could be available by 2021. It could fly up to two missions a year and still have enough to start developing the necessary pieces for a mission to an asteroid, like a deep-space habitat -- essentially a living room for astronauts during long space trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Hutchison said there was now broad support from the administration and both parties in Congress on the space exploration plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said even among the ardent budget cutters in her party, ''they have not cut the core mission of NASA, because they see that as part of the American spirit and most certainly part of the American economy and America's national security where we cannot afford to be in second place.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From double sunrise to double sunset the show goes on, always changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the orange sun rises first. Sometimes it is the red one, although they are never far apart in the sky and you can see them moving around each other, casting double shadows across the firmament and periodically crossing right in front of each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is life, if it were possible, on the latest addition to the pantheon of weird planets now known to exist outside the bounds of our own solar system. It is the first planet, astronomers say, that has been definitely shown to be orbiting two stars at once, circling the pair -- which themselves orbit each other tightly -- at a distance of some 65 million miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of astronomers using NASA's Kepler planet-hunting spacecraft announced the discovery on Thursday in a paper published online in the journal Science, in a talk at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in a news conference at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., Kepler's headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official name of the new planet is Kepler 16b, but astronomers are already referring to it informally as Tatooine, after the home planet of Luke and Anakin Skywalker in the George Lucas ''Star Wars'' movies, which also had two suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reality has finally caught up with science fiction,'' said Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution, a member of the research team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, John Knoll, who is a visual effects supervisor at <span class="companylink">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</span>, which is part of <span class="companylink">Lucasfilm</span>, and who worked on several of the ''Star Wars'' movies, joined the Ames news conference and showed a clip from the original movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Again and again we see that the science is stranger and weirder than fiction,'' Mr. Knoll said. ''The very existence of this discovery gives us cause to dream bigger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some double-star systems, of which there are billions in the galaxy, have been suspected to harbor planets, those smaller bodies have never been seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a direct detection; it removes all doubt,'' said Laurance Doyle of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who led the discovery team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the wow factor, astronomers said the discovery -- as so many discoveries of so-called exoplanets have done -- had thrown a wrench into another well-received theory of how planets can and cannot form. ''In other words,'' said Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not part of the discovery team, ''people don't really know how to form this planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was long thought, Dr. Seager said, that for its orbit to be stable, a planet belonging to two stars at once would have to be at least seven times as far from the stars as the stars were from each other. According to that, Kepler 16b would have to be twice as far out as it is to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This planet broke the rule,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, by timing all the eclipses and transits of the planet and stars in the system, the astronomers have been able to measure the sizes and masses of the stars and the planet to unusually high precision, calibrating models of stellar and planetary properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe this is the best-measured planet outside the solar system,'' Dr. Doyle said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, Tatooine is probably a ball of rock and gas about the size and density of Saturn living in a system about 200 light-years away, in the constellation Cygnus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you go, pack to wear layers. Because those suns move back and forth all the time, temperatures on the planet can change by 50 degrees or more over the course of a few Earth days, from minus 100 to minus 150 Fahrenheit. So the weather is like ''a nippy day in Antarctica at best,'' as Dr. Doyle put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in 2009, is on a mission to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that have Earth-like planets. It scrutinizes a patch of some 155,000 stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra looking for dips in starlight when planets cross in front of their home stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the Kepler 16 system -- home to Tatooine -- there turned out to be a lot of dips. The two stars are about 20 million miles apart and produce two eclipses every 41 days as they take turns going in front of each other. One star is about two-thirds the mass of the Sun, the other about a fifth of the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there are smaller dips when the planet, which is about 65 million miles from the center of the system -- about the distance of Venus from the Sun -- passes in front of each of the stars in the course of its 229-day orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The degree of dimming during the planetary transits -- those times that a planet crosses the path of something else -- usually allows Kepler astronomers to measure the size of a planet relative to the stars. As a result, uncertainties in the properties of stars propagate into uncertainties of as much as 25 percent in the mass of a planet -- enough to blur the line between a rocky planet and a gaseous one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the Kepler 16 system, by comparing slight variations in the timing of the transits with calculations of the positions of the stars and the gravitational nudges the bodies give one another, Dr. Doyle's team could deduce the absolute masses and sizes of the stars and planets in the system. That is a tool, they say, that is becoming increasingly valuable for determining the masses of small planets in multiple-planet systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, said Dr. Doyle, ''it's a laboratory for all sorts of physics and stellar evolution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tatooine laboratory will be available to a wide audience for at least a while longer. Dr. Doyle noted that amateur astronomers in northern Asia, equipped with as little as an eight-inch telescope and an off-the-shelf C.C.D. detector (an electronic device that cameras use to capture images), would be able to record the passage of the Tatooine planet across the brighter star in its system on June 28 next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But enjoy it while you can. Because of variations in the planet's orbital plane, as seen from Earth, the planet will stop crossing one of the stars as soon as 2014 and cease transiting the other, brighter one in 2018. It will be around 2042 before the show starts up again for Earthlings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Earth, the Moon looks as though it is constantly changing. But, on the lunar surface where the only breeze is the solar wind, there is an eerie permanence. Witness the photographs of three of the Apollo landing sites taken recently by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. They show the undisturbed trails left by American astronauts on foot and in their moon buggy four decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now asking what can be done to protect what it calls these ''heritage sites.'' What worries NASA is the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, which offers a $20 million reward to the first private team that can land a robot anywhere on the Moon, cover a distance of around 500 yards and send data and images back to Earth. Twenty-nine teams are in the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA would like to keep the competitors away from the Apollo landing sites, and it wants to create a no-fly-and-no-drive zone above and around them, especially where the first and last manned Moon missions -- Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 -- landed. The risk is that dust kicked up by a successful landing, or a crash, could disturb the traces of our presence on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no mention yet how the rules would be enforced. But they do give rise to some interesting thoughts. In the realms of science fiction, the universe abounds in the relics of civilizations scattered among the stars. These landing sites are the first, fragile relics left by actual humans on a nonterrestrial body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are a celebration of one of the 20th century's extraordinary achievements. Looking at their stark clarity -- footprints still precisely etched in the dust -- we also can't help remembering how quickly our own planet erases the traces of the past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An amateur astronomer in France captured video of an American satellite as it tumbled through space toward an expected impact with Earth sometime on Friday, according to NASA's latest projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frenchman, Thierry Legault, posted the footage to a personal Web site and said it had been shot last week from the northern town of Dunkerque using a specially modified telescope. The object, he said, was approximately 150 miles above ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, known as the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite or U.A.R.S., appears as a ghostly white form, spreading and narrowing as it corkscrews down at an increasingly fast rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA puts the chance of this six-ton piece of defunct equipment hitting a human somewhere on the planet at 1 in 3,200, despite a trail of debris that will likely stretch to about 500 miles. As my colleague Kenneth Chang reported this week, there are no known cases of injury by falling satellite, not even from the much larger Skylab space station that plummeted out of orbit and into western Australia in 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the extremely long odds, NASA sought to reassure jittery Americans that there is nothing to worry about, noting early Thursday that their latest calculations do not include a collision with the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Legault and his sky-watching partner, Emmanuel Rietsch, were the subject of a profile in Wired magazine earlier this year that marveled at their ability to capture American intelligence satellites that usually remain unseen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odds that a falling satellite will kill you on Friday are probably zero -- but maybe not quite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dead hulk of a NASA satellite the size of a bus is skimming the top of the atmosphere, and as air molecules bounce off, its orbit is decaying until gravity finally pulls it down as a fiery meteor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be specific, 26 large pieces of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, the heaviest about 330 pounds, are expected to survive all the way and hit the surface. The debris will stretch along a 500-mile path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time that NASA has been spewing out bland itinerary updates -- by Wednesday evening, North America had been ruled out as a crash pad -- the event has turned into a bit of a media and pop culture phenomenon. Just about every major news outlet started weighing in on the impending arrival. On <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, people were linking to news stories and adding their own ruminations, like ''Wear a hardhat'' and ''Should we be concerned?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Fox News, the anchor Shepard Smith dubbed Friday ''Bus Day U.S.A.'' and called the network's coverage ''the stupidest thing we've ever done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on MSNBC.com, about 5,000 readers answered a poll about the satellite's predicted course. Ten percent were ''relieved that it's likely to miss North America'' while 34 percent were ''bummed out at missing the fireworks'' and 42 percent were ''worried ... what about the rest of the world?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some concerned citizens took the opportunity to contemplate our collective plight. ''Many of us are hard-wired to be paranoid about things falling from the sky,'' wrote an editorialist in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ''Cold rain, rocks dropped by delinquents from highway overpasses and air show accidents freak us out. They awaken in us that primal fear that thunderbolts were flung from heaven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, this satellite's impending re-entry has not generated as much concern and good-humored fun as when the Skylab space station fell to Earth in July 1979. Skylab was much bigger -- about the size of a house -- while the current projectile is more along the lines of a city bus. When bits of Skylab fell in Western Australia, no one was injured but the local authorities did fine NASA $400 for littering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, John Belushi appeared on Weekend Update on ''Saturday Night Live,'' maniacally ramming a handheld model of Skylab into a globe. People threw parties, bought Skylab ''crash helmets,'' and wore T-shirts with bull's-eye targets. (The T-shirt wearers reasoned that the United States government could not hit the broad side of a barn, therefore by wearing a bull's-eye, they were safe.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, there has been little if any merchandizing. Various Web sites have tried to track the progress of the descending satellite, and Space.com has assembled a list of the ''worst space debris events of all time.'' Those include fallout from the explosion of the space shuttle Columbia, which rained on parts of Texas and Louisiana in 2003, and the small chunk of a Delta 2 rocket booster that fluttered onto an Oklahoma woman, Lottie Williams, in 1997 -- the only person known to have been hit by space debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has calculated a 1-in-3,200 chance of anyone on Earth being hurt by its satellite's death plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The funny thing is that I have a better chance of getting hit by this satellite than winning the lottery,'' Chanan Carroll, a Baltimore rabbi, wrote on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was not true, even when there was a possibility of the satellite landing in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odds of demise-by-satellite for any particular person among the world's seven billion people are much lower, on the order of 1-in-trillions, said Nicholas L. Johnson, NASA's expert on space debris at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Thursday afternoon, NASA had narrowed the time of re-entry on Friday to between noon and 6 p.m. Eastern time. The satellite circles the Earth four times in six hours, but none of the Friday afternoon orbits pass over North America. That increases the odds, still infinitesimal, for people living in areas of Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe that do lie along the trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rabbi Carroll, for one, thought that NASA's reticence in narrowing down the impact site to be clever disaster management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that NASA knows exactly where and when it's coming down,'' he wrote. ''If they let the word out, a thousand idiots will gather at the impact site, waiting to get whacked. And their lawyers can sue NASA. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science of predicting where a tumbling satellite is going to fall is tricky. The Earth's atmosphere puffs up and deflates depending on how strongly the sun is shining on a particular day, and that phenomenon speeds or slows the rate of falling. If a calculation is off by half an hour, the falling satellite has already traveled one-third of the way around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in 1991 by the space shuttle Discovery, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite was decommissioned in 2005 and placed into a lower orbit so it would not cause any problems for the International Space Station. Now, in what NASA calls an ''uncontrolled'' re-entry -- there is no more fuel to guide it -- it will plop down somewhere on Friday afternoon, give or take a few hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, #UARS has turned into a popular hashtag on Twitter. ''I'm selling anti-satellite-debris umbrellas for $145 each,'' one user wrote.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hours after it was supposed to have made a fiery plunge back to Earth, a wayward NASA satellite was still in orbit, and space experts were still uncertain when exactly it would fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 10:50 p.m. Friday, NASA posted an update that said the satellite, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, was expected to re-enter between 11:45 p.m. Friday and 12:45 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During that time, the satellite will be passing over Canada and Africa, as well as vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans,'' the update said. A day earlier, NASA had said it expected re-entry on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The satellite's orientation or configuration apparently has changed,'' the space agency said in an earlier update. Perhaps some piece had broken off, leaving it more streamlined as it tumbled through the upper atmosphere. ''That is now slowing its descent,'' NASA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, which weighs six tons, circles the Earth on a tilted orbit, and as the planet turns each day, different locations pass underneath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 26 pieces, the largest at 330 pounds, are expected to survive the plunge and land along a path 500 miles long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has forecast a 1-in-3,200 risk that debris from the satellite could injure someone, and the risk for any individual is infinitesimal. NASA's Twitter feed emphatically said: ''The chances that you (yes, I mean YOU) will be hit by a piece of the #UARS satellite today are one in several trillion. Very unlikely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no known instances of anyone being injured by falling space debris (though in 1997, a woman in Oklahoma was brushed by a piece of mesh from a Delta 2 rocket booster that did her no harm). When the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry in 2003, the seven astronauts aboard died, but no one on the ground was hurt as 42.5 tons of debris showered down from West Texas to southwest Louisiana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA satellites also receive considerably more attention when they come back to Earth than other debris of similar size. About one satellite five metric tons or larger re-enters the atmosphere every year. For example, on a test flight of its Falcon 9 rocket in June 2010, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> placed the second stage and a prototype capsule into orbit. That object, comparable in weight to the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, came crashing back to Earth two and a half weeks later, close to the northeast coast of South America with hardly a media ripple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If by vanishingly small chance, the NASA satellite hit your house, by international treaty, NASA would be responsible for paying compensation for any damage and injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite debris, however, remains government property, and NASA warned that people should not approach or touch any pieces they might come across.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When New York made its pitch for one of NASA's decommissioned space shuttles, one of its selling points was location: a glistening berth on the Hudson River alongside the aircraft carrier that is home to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But five months after the Intrepid was awarded the shuttle Enterprise, museum officials have turned their attention from the end of the newly revamped pier to a parking lot on 12th Avenue, across the cacophonous West Side Highway. They envision converting the lot, which is surrounded by H &amp; H Bagels, a car wash, storage warehouses and a strip club, into a space-themed museum that would serve as the home of the Enterprise and draw as many as one million visitors a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aesthetics aside, the plan has several obstacles to clear. One problem is that the Intrepid does not own the parking lot; the State Department of Transportation does. Another is that the property, in Hell's Kitchen, is zoned for manufacturing, not a museum. And perhaps the biggest hurdle is the many millions of dollars that would have to be raised to build this new home for the Enterprise, which was a prototype for the space shuttles but never flew into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tentative state of the plan highlights how much less certain the Intrepid's proposal was than those of some other museums that lobbied for one of the shuttles. The Museum of Flight in Seattle, for example, spent $11 million to build a structure that would house a shuttle, but did not get one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston, home of the Johnson Space Center, was also shut out in a decision that enraged elected officials in Texas. Representative Ted Poe, a Republican, said the Intrepid's preference for a different location for the Enterprise might be cause to revisit NASA's selection process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as I'm concerned, it won't be final until it's sitting up there on the Hudson River where it's supposed to finally be,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokesman, Michael Curie, said agency officials were aware of the changes in the Intrepid's plans and did not ''foresee any issues that would prevent transferring Enterprise to Intrepid in 2012.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum's president, Susan Marenoff-Zausner, said in an interview that she envisioned a museum ''with the shuttle as the primary tenant'' but also with classrooms and laboratories for teaching schoolchildren and others about science and technology. ''It would be a museum on that side of the highway, which we think could be a linchpin in beautifying the area,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marenoff-Zausner said she had discussed the idea with NASA officials but had not yet made formal requests for financial help from the state or city governments. She said it was too soon to say just how big the museum would be, how it would look or what it would cost. But she suggested that the shuttle would be visible from outside the building and could ''get more exposure on the highway'' than on the pier that serves as the entryway to the floating museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When officials of the Intrepid museum first broached the idea of bidding for one of the shuttles, they said a transparent building would be constructed for it at the end of the pier. It was to replace a Concorde supersonic jet that has stood on Pier 86 since the pier was rebuilt three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Concorde, on long-term loan from <span class="companylink">British Airways</span>, is part of the Intrepid's eclectic collection of aircraft and military memorabilia. The ship that houses the museum played a minor role in the space program, picking up astronauts after they splashed down upon returning from space. The museum's executives used that connection in their bid for one of the decommissioned shuttles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As NASA was winding down the shuttle program, it offered its three remaining orbiters to museums. After fielding more than 20 responses, NASA, in April, awarded the shuttle Atlantis to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Endeavour to the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The third, Discovery, was awarded to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. There, it will replace the Enterprise, making the prototype available to the Intrepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the choices NASA made, the selection of the Intrepid drew the most complaints, as critics scoffed at New York's tenuous ties to the space program. On Wednesday, Mr. Poe renewed his objection, saying, ''That's like putting the Statue of Liberty in Omaha.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Marenoff-Zausner countered that the Intrepid's annex, on the east side of 12th Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets, would be ''the only representation of NASA in the entire Northeast corridor.'' She said that building a full museum would not necessarily change the schedule previously laid out by NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report last month that concluded a review of the shuttle awards, NASA's inspector general said the Enterprise would be moved from the Smithsonian to Kennedy International Airport in April 2012. It would be stored in a ''climate-controlled tent'' inside a hangar at the airport for about two years, then ferried on a barge to the Intrepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marenoff-Zausner was not prepared to say when the museum would be ready for the arrival of the Enterprise, or how it would be moved from a barge on the river and across the West Side Highway. She said the museum was preparing for fund-raising and would seek to change the zoning on the site to allow the museum. The site is part of an industrial section that was rezoned in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the first order of business is to strike a deal with the owner of the parking lot, the Department of Transportation. Museum officials met in late July with the state commissioner of transportation, Joan McDonald, to propose the plan. The commissioner has not yet decided if the state is willing to turn over the land, a spokesman for the department said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Ackerman is the author of ''One Hundred Names for Love'' and ''The Zookeeper's Wife.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOLDILOCKS is alive in the constellation Vela. Her real name is HD 85512b, which may not roll off the tongue, but it's sheer poetry to the ears of sky watchers like me, who long for signs of an Earth-like planet that might harbor life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This newly discovered planet orbits its sun in what's called the ''Goldilocks,'' or habitable zone, at the right distance for liquid water to sparkle on the surface and life to bloom in the shallows. Life as we know it, anyway, with wings and dreams, if the planet has a rocky surface -- and isn't too hot or too cold -- as well as a tent of clouds for shade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a lot of ifs, which is why other candidates have been scarce. This is our best hope, though she's 36 light-years away, beyond the reach of our spacecrafts or clear view of present telescopes, but well within the imagination. Her temperatures may range from 85 to 120 degrees, which conjures up images of equatorial Africa, or much of the hot, muggy United States this past July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past month has been a marvel in the planetary world. In addition to HD 85512b, astronomers spotted a planet that may be fashioned entirely of diamond, a brilliant diadem set in the black velvet of space. For all we know, it has baguette moons in tow. And a few weeks later, planet hunters confirmed the discovery of Kepler-16b, a planet that circles two suns in the constellation Cygnus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ''Star Wars'' saga, Luke Skywalker hailed from such a world, Tatooine, where he paused from work on his uncle's moisture farm to enjoy a smoldery suns-set. Until now a stable planet orbiting twin suns was science fiction, strictly hints and hunches. Wouldn't the quarreling gravity of two suns shear the planet apart, swallow it whole, or hurtle it off into space? Apparently not. Such solar systems, with winking suns that eclipse one another every few weeks, may be common throughout the universe. That's the best thing about discovery, how it widens the mind's eye, refines the scope of our inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, we won't be glimpsing these worlds anytime soon, I'm afraid. If we want to explore in fine detail, we'll need better eyes in the sky and faster robotic spaceships. I'm for both. Despite all the problems that beset us, we're on the threshold of a new era of exploration and discovery. Scientists are asking thrilling questions, like: what existed before the universe? How did we get from the Big Bang to the whole shebang? Can we design spaceships that fly faster than the speed of light? Do other planetarians haunt the wilderness of space, or are we alone? I hope we'll continue sending scouts around our solar system, and use the planets as stepping stones to the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a new goal, but one of humanity's oldest yearnings. Every society has been tantalized by the great loom of the sky with its flowing quilt of stars. The Egyptian pyramids may have been arranged like the belt stars of Orion, pointing to Sirius, so that the pharaoh's soul would be launched into the heavens where he'd shimmer as a star. To the San people in the Kalahari, the Milky Way is the ''backbone of night.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 20th century, we sent robot emissaries to explore the solar system and voyage deep into space. With the cupped ears of radio telescopes, we began listening for voices from other worlds. We rode fierce winds to the Moon and looked back in wonder, amazed to see Earth whole. Viewed from space, Earth had no visible fences, military zones or national borders. But it did have the thinnest rind -- an atmosphere embracing the sky, weather systems and all of human history. That image from an Apollo mission changed everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're explorers by design, right down to our cells, and we thrive on quests. Stars flare like distant campfires overhead, and we wonder if they're home to other worlds like our own. Or made of diamond. I'm hoping NASA will continue to find the boosters it needs, because our compass points to the stars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years the Park Avenue Armory has transformed its cavernous drill hall into everything including a science-fiction fun house and a landscape created from 30 tons of discarded clothing. For its next act the New York artist Tom Sachs will offer "SPACE PROGRAM 2.0: Mars,'' his fictional mission to the planet. The project is a presentation of the Armory and Creative Time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs has been obsessed with space exploration for quite some time. A film on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> chronicles a man-to-the-moon attempt. That was part of a 2007 exhibition, "SPACE PROGRAM," at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles in which white NASA lab coats were designed by Miuccia Prada, the astronauts' booties were created by <span class="companylink">Nike</span> and T-shirts accompanying the show were courtesy of Banana Republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, for "SPACE PROGRAM 2.0: Mars,'' a monthlong mission taking place from May 18 through June 17, Mr. Sachs has created a spacecraft, exploratory vehicles, mission control, launch platforms and a Martian landscape. He has also produced "elaborate instruments of space travel out of glue, packaging and found materials," according to a news release. Mr. Sachs and his crew of 13 will be on hand, performing various procedures, rituals and tasks. His mission: to simulate all aspects of a Mars launch without ever leaving Park Avenue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union put the first artificial satellite, Sputnik I, into the Earth’s orbit, signifying the birth of the Space Age. The spherical satellite, which was about the size of a beach ball and weighed 184 pounds, was able to orbit the Earth in 98 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The  Oct. 5 edition of The New York Times [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/on-this-day/October-4/] noted that experts had said that satellites had “no practicable military application in the foreseeable future.” The article further explained, “Their real significance would be in providing scientists with important new information concerning the nature of the sun, cosmic radiation, solar radio interference and static- producing phenomena radiating from the north and south magnetic poles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the United States had been also working on launching a satellite, the far smaller Vanguard. The Soviet Union “did not pass up the opportunity to use the launching for propaganda purposes,” <span class="companylink">The Times</span> noted. “It said in its announcement that people now could see how ‘the new socialist society’ had turned the boldest dreams of mankind into reality.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of Sputnik spurred the U.S. to restart its Explorer program, which put the first American satellite into space in January 1958 (but not before the launch of Sputnik 2). The escalation of the Space Race between the U.S. and Soviet Union drove the advancement of space technology over the next decade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three astronomers won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for discovering that the universe is apparently being blown apart by a mysterious force that cosmologists now call dark energy, a finding that has thrown the fate of the universe and indeed the nature of physics into doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers are Saul Perlmutter, 52, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley; Brian P. Schmidt, 44, of the Australian National University in Canberra; and Adam G. Riess, 41, of the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm stunned,'' Dr. Riess said by e-mail, after learning of his prize by reading about it on The New York Times's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three men led two competing teams of astronomers who were trying to use the exploding stars known as Type 1a supernovae as cosmic lighthouses to limn the expansion of the universe. The goal of both groups was to measure how fast the cosmos, which has been expanding since its fiery birth in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago, was slowing down, and thus to find out if its ultimate fate was to fall back together in what is called a Big Crunch or to drift apart into the darkness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the two groups found in 1998 that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up, a conclusion that nobody would have believed if not for the fact that both sets of scientists wound up with the same answer. It was as if, when you tossed your car keys in the air, instead of coming down, they flew faster and faster to the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent cosmological measurements have confirmed that roughly 70 percent of the universe by mass or energy consists of this antigravitational dark energy that is pushing the galaxies apart, though astronomers and physicists have no conclusive evidence of what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely explanation for this bizarre behavior is a fudge factor that Albert Einstein introduced into his equations in 1917 to stabilize the universe against collapse and then abandoned as his greatest blunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quantum theory predicts that empty space should exert a repulsive force, like dark energy, but one that is 10 to the 120th power times stronger than what the astronomers have measured, leaving some physicists mumbling about multiple universes. Abandoning the Einsteinian dream of a single final theory of nature, they speculate that there are a multitude of universes with different properties. We live in one, the argument goes, that is suitable for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every test we have made has come out perfectly in line with Einstein's original cosmological constant in 1917,'' Dr. Schmidt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the universe continues accelerating, astronomers say, rather than coasting gently into the night, distant galaxies will eventually be moving apart so quickly that they cannot communicate with one another and all the energy will be sucked out of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Witten, a theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study, Einstein's old stomping grounds, called dark energy ''the most startling discovery in physics since I have been in the field.'' Dr. Witten continued, ''It was so startling, in fact, that I personally took quite a while to become convinced that it was right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on, ''This discovery definitely changed the way physicists look at the universe, and we probably still haven't fully come to grips with the implications.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perlmutter, who led the Supernova Cosmology Project out of Berkeley, will get half of the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.4 million). The other half will go to Dr. Schmidt, leader of the rival High-Z Supernova Search Team, and Dr. Riess, who was the lead author of the 1998 paper in The Astronomical Journal, in which the dark energy result was first published.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three astronomers were born and raised in the United States; Dr. Schmidt is also a citizen of Australia. They will get their prizes in Stockholm on Dec. 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the fate of the universe is in question, astronomers would love to do more detailed tests using supernovas and other observations. So they were dispirited last year when NASA announced that cost overruns and delays on the James Webb Space Telescope had left no room in the budget until the next decade for an American satellite mission to investigate dark energy that Dr. Perlmutter and others had been promoting for almost a decade. Indeed on Tuesday the European Space Agency announced that it would launch a mission called Euclid to study dark energy in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic expansion was discovered by Edwin Hubble, an astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, Calif., in 1929, but the quest for precision measurements of the universe has been hindered by a lack of reliable standard candles, objects whose distance can be inferred by their brightness or some other observable characteristic. Type 1a supernovae, which are thought to result from explosions of small stars known as white dwarfs, have long been considered uniform enough to fill the bill, as well as bright enough to be seen across the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1980s Dr. Perlmutter, who had just gotten a Ph.D. in physics, devised an elaborate plan involving networks of telescopes tied together by the Internet to detect and study such supernovae and use them to measure the presumed deceleration of the universe. The Supernova Cosmology Project endured criticism from other astronomers, particularly supernova experts, who doubted that particle physicists could do it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, it took seven years before Dr. Perlmutter's team began harvesting supernovae in the numbers it needed. Meanwhile, the other astronomers had formed their own team, the High-Z team, to do the same work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hey, what's the strongest force in the universe?'' Robert P. Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and a mentor to many of the astronomers on the new team, asked a reporter from this newspaper once. ''It's not gravity, it's jealousy,'' Dr. Kirshner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with The Associated Press, Dr. Perlmutter described the subsequent work of the teams as ''a long aha.'' The presence of dark energy showed up in an expected faintness on the part of some distant supernovae: the universe had sped up and carried them farther away from us than conventional cosmology suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recounted by the science writer Richard Panek in his recent book, ''The 4% Universe, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of Reality,'' neither team was eager to report such a strange result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 1998, Dr. Riess interrupted preparations for his honeymoon to buck up his comrades. ''Approach these results not with your heart or head but with your eyes,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''We are observers after all!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years since, the three astronomers have shared a number of awards, sometimes giving lectures in which they completed one another's sentences. A Nobel was expected eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No more waiting!'' Dr. Kirshner said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online Correction: October 4, 2011, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the publication in which Adam G. Riess's 1998 paper on dark energy appeared. It was The Astronomical Journal, not Science. The article also stated incorrectly the amount of the prize. It is 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.4 million).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The knowledge gained from the Apollo 7 mission helped NASA launch the more ambitious Apollo 8 two months later. Apollo 8 became the first manned mission to leave Earth's orbit to complete an orbit of the moon. In July 1969, nine months after Apollo 7, NASA accomplished the goal of the Apollo program, putting two men on the moon in Apollo 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 11, 1968, Apollo 7 was launched from Cape Kennedy, Fla., with astronauts Wally Schirra, Donn Fulton Eisele and R. Walter Cunningham aboard, beginning an 11-day mission in Earth orbit. It was the first successful manned mission of the Apollo program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oct. 12 New York Times reported: "Apollo 7's main objective is to demonstrate the spacecraft's safety and reliability for journeys to the moon." The crew performed maneuvers that were "critical to preparations for flying astronauts to the moon, which is the primary goal of the nation's $24-billion Apollo project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of Apollo 7 helped NASA recover from the tragic failure of Apollo 1 , in which three astronauts were killed in a cabin fire during a routine test on the launch pad. As a result, NASA made many improvements to its capsules and safety procedures for future missions like Apollo 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Atlantis completed its last mission in July 2011. With it, the space shuttle program ended. However, there is still hope for aspiring astronauts. NASA announced on Oct. 7, 2011 that it is seeking applicants for the next astronaut candidate class. Future missions will be "long duration," traveling to the International Space Station or exploring deep space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make a two-minute video. Get an experiment flown to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and Lenovo, the computer manufacturer, announced on Monday a science contest called SpaceLab for students around the world ages 14 to 18, and it is not quite like any other science contest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, the students, who can enter individually or in teams of up to three, do not actually have to perform any experiments. Instead, they will make videos to pitch ideas for experiments that could be conducted in the zero-gravity environs of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two winning entries will be built and flown there, and astronauts will conduct a demonstration that will be broadcast to classrooms via <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The headline idea was, 'let's create the world's largest, coolest classroom in space,' '' said Zahaan Bharmal, director of European marketing for <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which owns <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These will not be the first student experiments to get to the space station. Students at 12 school districts around the country are currently writing proposals for experiments to fly there next spring, part of a program run by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education in Capitol Heights, Md. ''It's changing the way kids are looking at science,'' said Jeff Goldstein, the center's director. ''I'm hoping that what we're doing here is creating those magical moments for many of these students.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, 27 student experiments, out of 1,027 proposals, flew on the last two space shuttle flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those experiments were small -- each about the size of a test tube -- but meaningful. One, from seventh graders in Portland, Ore., tested the growth of protein crystals in microgravity, while another, from 10th graders in Omaha, was titled, ''Honey as a Preservative on Long Duration Space Flights.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These students are being given the opportunity to do real research in orbit,'' Dr. Goldstein said. ''It's not something cute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His program stems from an existing agreement between NASA and NanoRacks, a small company that owns laboratory space on the space station. The cost is $20,000 per school district, but the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education raised enough to pay for 21 of the 27 districts that took part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Goldstein said that he hoped to fly two sets of experiments every year, and that the next opportunity for school districts to participate would be announced in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NanoRacks has also sold space to a single school, Valley Christian High School in San Jose, Calif., which conducted a 30-day experiment in February looking at how basil, marigolds and Wisconsin fast plants, a relative of broccoli bred for classroom use, behaved in microgravity. (The seeds germinated, but did not grow much, possibly because of gases released from the sealant used to seal the box.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been able to see more of what a real-life science career would be like than if I had just gone through school and sat through the classes,'' said Karen Lu, a junior at Valley Christian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> contest, NASA has signed an agreement with Space Adventures, a company in Vienna, Va., that is best known for arranging trips by space tourists to the space station. Space Adventures will act as a middleman to prepare the winning experiments for flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bharmal came up with the idea when <span class="companylink">Google</span> invited employees to suggest a marketing campaign. ''When I was a teenager, 15 or 16, space was the thing that really inspired me,'' said Mr. Bharmal, now 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experiment proposals can cover science questions in biology or physics. Restrictions include no dangerous animals, no explosions and nothing sharp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Dec. 7 deadline, entries will be whittled to 60 finalists, distributed among three geographical regions. For each region, there will be 10 finalists in the 14-to-16-year-old category and 10 in the 17-to-18-year-old category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A popular vote among <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> visitors will provide one-quarter of the final score. Also judging the finalists will be a panel of experts including Stephen W. Hawking, the physicist and cosmologist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> will the fly the regional winners to a ceremony in Washington next March, where two grand prize winners will be named. Those winners will get the choice of a trip to Japan to see the launching of their experiments or a trip to Russia for seven days of cosmonaut training, although for the latter, they would need to wait until they turned 18.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tussle on Capitol Hill over the space shuttle Enterprise continued on Tuesday with a senator from Ohio demanding that NASA rescind its award to New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, sent a letter to Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, asking him to reconsider his decision to give Enterprise to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown cited the Intrepid's plan - first reported in The New York Times - to place the shuttle in a new building across the West Side Highway from the aircraft carrier that houses the museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum uses the property as a parking lot but does not own it. The lot, which is designated for manufacturing uses, would have to be rezoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the Intrepid museum's plan was to build a new facility in an area of New York that it does not currently have permission to build on, that should have been made clear to NASA from the start," Mr. Brown said. "This report makes it evident that New York City was, and still is, woefully unprepared to house the Enterprise space shuttle. This also raises further questions about the thoroughness of NASA's selection process - and I urge NASA to revisit its decision to send the Enterprise to New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden announced in April that the three remaining shuttles that have flown in space - Atlantis, Endeavour and Discovery - would go to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the California Science Center in Los Angeles and the National Air and Space Museum annex in Virginia. Enterprise, which is a prototype for the orbiters and is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum, would then be transported to New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA gave Intrepid officials until Jan. 12 to pay $8.3 million to cover the costs of the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he has done for months, Mr. Brown made a pitch in his letter for an unsuccessful bidder from Ohio, the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton. "They are ready today to accept a shuttle," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The senator's letter did not address the financial obstacle cited in a report issued in August by NASA's inspector general. That report, which reviewed the award process, revealed that, in April, officials of the Air Force museum had told NASA that they did not believe they could raise the $28.8 million the agency was asking for a shuttle that had gone into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said that NASA staffers made an error in scoring the proposals that shortchanged the Air Force museum. Absent that mistake, the Air Force museum would have received the same score as the Intrepid, the report said. But General Bolden told investigators that he still would have chosen the Intrepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown's plea follows calls for a recount from other districts, including Seattle and the Houston area. Elected officials in Texas have been decrying the denial of a shuttle to the Space Center Houston since April, a disappointment that was stoked again by news of the Intrepid's changing plan for displaying the shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late September, Douglas R. King, the chief executive of the Museum of Flight in Seattle, met with NASA officials to argue that evaluators gave his museum too few points for its annual attendance and the number of foreign visitors to the city and gave the Intrepid too much credit for its readiness to accept a shuttle. The Museum of Flight spent more than $10 million on a building that was intended to house a shuttle, a spokesman for the museum said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| In this lesson, students read about a new contest seeking student science experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station. They learn more about space-based research, design experiments they would like to see carried out in microgravity and develop scripts for video pitches to promote their ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Computers with Internet access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Introduce or review the terms "Newton's laws of motion" and "surface tension of water" and jot them on the board. Then show the following two videos from World Science Festival: "Fun, Games, and Newtonian Physics in Space" and "The Stickiness of Water." Then ask: How did the videos teach you about Newton's laws of motion? How did both the coin toss and the tackle on the International Space Station play out differently than they would on Earth? How does water on the International Space Station behave differently than it does on Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explain that scientists sometimes want to ask questions about how gravity affects a process, like cell division or plant growth. To answer those questions, they need to remove gravity to see how those processes run without gravity affecting them. The best way to do that - at least for periods of time longer than a few seconds -- is to conduct research in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lead a quick brainstorm, encouraging students to think about other questions they may have about physical processes in space. To help get them started, you might provide the following prompts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Given how water behaves in a microgravity environment, do you think other materials might behave differently in space as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Could the water in living systems, like our bodies or plants, behave differently in space? How else might traveling in space affect the human body?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* What other physical phenomena does gravity affect? What might we learn by studying these processes in the absence of gravity?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| In the article "Challenge to Students: Have Space Station Run Your Experiments," Kenneth Chang announces a new competition inviting high school students to produce videos pitching their ideas for experiments to run on the International Space Station in the microgravity of low-earth orbit:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| For discussion and reading comprehension:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Working individually or in pairs, students propose research questions and design experiments to be conducted in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station, then pitch their ideas to their classmates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin, you may want to walk students through the Designing the Fight Experiment resource produced by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education, which clearly guides students through the process of thinking up a research question and designing an experiment to be carried out in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource nicely sums up the overarching question behind spaceflight research thus: "What phenomenon associated with a physical, chemical, or biological system would I like to explore with gravity turned off for a period of time?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that guiding question in mind, invite students to browse some of the kinds of space-based research currently under way on the I.S.S. as well as studies carried out on previous space shuttle missions, like the Columbia's 2003 flight, which ran more than 90 experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer product companies, for example, use research in microgravity to develop fluids with improved physical properties, such as fabric softeners or pharmaceuticals whose ingredients don't separate. One perfume company even sent a rose on a space shuttle flight to learn if fragrances behave differently in space. It turns out they do - and the scent has been incorporated into a perfume sold by a Japanese personal care products company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also has conducted extensive research on the effects of space flight on the human body. Fluids in the body, for example, distribute differently in the absence of gravity, and during extended periods of space travel, astronauts can lose bone and muscle mass because their bodies no longer have to resist the pull of gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At age 77, John Glenn, who in 1962 became the first American to orbit the Earth, flew on a 1998 mission in part to help medical experts learn more about the biological effects of aging and space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students also might browse a list of team and individual projects that have flown on the space shuttles Atlantis and Endeavor to learn more about the kinds of experiments their peers have run in microgravity. Winning projects included investigations into whether ethanol, used in many hand sanitizers, would kill E. coli bacteria in microgravity and how fish eggs develop in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other challenges, students have questioned whether drops of water would behave differently in microgravity than on earth when exposed to a static charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, students may check out sample submissions under the "Experiments" tab on the SpaceLab page describing the competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reviewing these resources, ask students what additional questions they have about physical or biological systems in space, and encourage them to work either individually or in teams to develop a research question and design an experiment to test it in space. The following questions may help them get started:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* What question would you like to explore in microgravity?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* What is your hypothesis? On what research or earlier observations are you basing your hypothesis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* How will you conduct your study? Have you identified your variables? Does your experiment have a control?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* How will your results be collected and analyzed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* If applicable, provide a sketch or prototype that helps visualize your experimental set-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To wrap up, have students write a script for a two-minute video meant to explain their question, hypothesis and experimental design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be sure students understand they will not be carrying out their experiments in the classroom - their task is to define the question they want to address, identify their hypothesis, and clearly explain how to carry out the experiment and gather data. Their experiments need to be explained clearly enough that an astronaut on the International Space Station, without any way to communicate with the student, could run the experiment and collect data independently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They might use the first page of our Laboratory Experiment graphic organizer (PDF) to develop their hypothesis and procedure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provide time for individuals and groups to share their ideas with the class and invite feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| For those students with a sincere interest in competing in SpaceLab, encourage them to produce videos and submit their proposals. To get them started, direct them to the resource on the SpaceLab <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> channel. You also may wish to review the teacher resources for guidance on how to help students enter the contest; direct students to the official rules for more detail on how to prepare entries, including tips on designing experiments and creating prototypes, as well as basic, but essential, information, such as how to register and contest deadlines.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla. -- A starship without an engine?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may seem a fantastical notion, but hardly more so than the idea of building a starship of any kind, especially with NASA's future uncertain at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet here in Orlando, not far from the launching site of the space program's most triumphant achievements, the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, drew hundreds this month to a symposium on the 100-Year Starship Study, which is devoted to ideas for visiting the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants -- an eclectic mix of engineers, scientists, science fiction fans, students and dreamers -- explored a mix of ideas, including how to organize and finance a century-long project; whether civilization would survive, because an engine to propel a starship could also be used for a weapon to obliterate the planet; and whether people need to go along for the trip. (Alternatively, machines could build humans at the destination, perhaps tweaked to live in non-Earth-like environs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The space program, any space program, needs a dream,'' said one participant, Joseph Breeden. ''If there are no dreamers, we'll never get anywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Dr. Breeden who offered the idea of an engineless starship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A physicist by training, he had most recently devised equations that forecast to banks how much they were going to lose on their consumer loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From his doctoral thesis, Dr. Breeden remembered that in a chaotic gravitational dance, stars are sometimes ejected at high speeds. The same effect, he believes, could propel starships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, find an asteroid in an elliptical orbit that passes close to the Sun. Second, put a starship in orbit around the asteroid. If the asteroid could be captured into a new orbit that clings close to the Sun, the starship would be flung on an interstellar trajectory, perhaps up to a tenth of the speed of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The chaotic dynamics of those two allow all the energy of one to be transferred to the other,'' said Dr. Breeden, who came toting copies of a paper describing the technique. ''It's a unique type of gravity assist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darpa, by design, pursues out-of-the-box projects without immediate military use. (In the 1960s and 1970s, for instance, the agency laid the groundwork for the Internet.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David L. Neyland, the director of tactical technology at Darpa, who orchestrated the one-year starship study, noted that his agency was founded more than 50 years ago as a response to Sputnik, the Soviet Union's cold war satellite coup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the research and development of technologies that could lead to a starship, he said, would likely create useful military spinoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At every step along the way in the space business, the Department of Defense has benefited,'' Mr. Neyland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the talks, speakers laid out challenges that, while herculean, did not seem out of the realm of the possible, even without resorting to exotic physics like ''Star Trek'' warp drives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the sheer distances are daunting. ''The problem of the stars is larger than most people realize,'' said James Benford, a physicist who organized sessions on starship propulsion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Obousy, president of Icarus Interstellar, an organization of volunteers that has already spent several years on starship designing, gave an analogy. If Earth were in Orlando and the closest star system, Alpha Centauri, were in Los Angeles, then NASA's two Voyager spacecraft, the most distant manmade objects, have traveled just one mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way of looking at the challenge is that in 10,000 years, the speed of humans has jumped by a factor of about 10,000, from a stroll (2.6 m.p.h.) to the Apollo astronauts' return from the Moon (26,000 m.p.h.). Reaching the nearest stars in reasonable time -- decades, not centuries -- would require a velocity jump of another factor of 10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first steps, however, are easy to imagine. Even in the 1950s, rocket scientists realized that the current engines -- burning kerosene or hydrogen and spewing flames out the nozzle -- are the rocket equivalent of gas guzzlers. They designed nuclear engines that use reactors to heat liquid hydrogen into a fast-moving stream of gas. NASA had such engines ready for a hypothetical manned mission to Mars to follow the Moon landings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the space agency has revived that work, beginning with studies on an ideal fuel for a space reactor, and new nuclear engines could be ready by the end of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for radioactivity concerns, the reactors would not be started until they reached space. ''Space is a wonderful place to use nuclear power, because it is already radioactive,'' said Geoffrey Landis, a scientist at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Ohio (and a science fiction author).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More advanced nuclear engines could use reactors to generate electric fields that accelerated charged ions for the thrust. Then fusion engines -- producing energy through the combining of hydrogen atoms -- could finally be powerful enough for interstellar travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Interplanetary Society put together a concept for a fusion-powered starship in the 1970s called Daedalus, extrapolating from known physics and technology. Dr. Obousy's group, Icarus Interstellar, is revisiting the Daedalus design to see if 30-some years of new technology can produce a better starship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daedalus dwarfs the Saturn 5, the rocket that took astronauts to the Moon. ''However, it's no bigger than a Nimitz aircraft carrier,'' Dr. Obousy said. ''We have the ability to create big things. We just don't have the ability to launch big things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Benford advocated another approach, harking back to the era of sailing ships. Giant sails on the starship could billow from photons beamed from Earth by lasers or giant antennae. ''Here's a case where we know the physics, and the engineering seems doable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, no one has yet built an energy-producing fusion reactor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the questions posed at the symposium seemed almost mundane: What kind of lights should a starship have? How do you pack enough spare parts for a 50-year trip when there's no <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> along the way? Other talks ruminated on theological and philosophical questions. ''Did Jesus Die for Klingons, Too?'' was the title of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vision without execution is daydreaming,'' Mr. Neyland said in his introductory remarks, paraphrasing a Japanese proverb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And what we're trying to inspire with the 100-Year Starship Study is that first step in establishing a bar that's high enough, with challenges that are hard enough that people will actually go start tackling some of these really hard problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Breeden, discussions with other attendees affirmed his underlying idea and calculations, but it seems unlikely that asteroid flinging would be sufficient by itself. Still, it could prove a useful and cost-effective supplement for other propulsions systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.1 million study -- $1 million from Darpa, $100,000 from NASA -- will culminate with the awarding of a $500,000 grant to an organization that will take the torch for further work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darpa would then exit the starship business, sidestepping interrogation by Congress during the next budget hearings of why it was spending taxpayer money on science fiction dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They want to get people thinking about a topic and propagate it very subtly,'' said Gregory Benford, a physics professor at the University of California, Irvine, who is also a science fiction author (and the twin brother of James Benford). ''They want it out of the budget by early next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps tellingly, no high-level NASA officials spoke at the symposium other than Pete Worden, director of the Ames Research Center in California, whom Mr. Neyland described as a ''co-conspirator'' and who is often regarded as a maverick in the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're lucky, it will change NASA,'' the science-fiction-writing Dr. Benford said of the starship research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some speakers said they thought the first goal over the next century should be colonizing the solar system, starting with Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Obousy, for one, made his preference known in a couplet:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On to the stars!</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By considering a proposal to put filling stations in the sky, NASA is looking to accelerate plans to send astronauts to distant destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The filling stations -- NASA calls them propellant depots -- would refuel a spacecraft in orbit before it headed out to the moon, an asteroid or eventually Mars. Currently, all of the fuel needed for a mission is carried up with the rocket, and the weight of the fuel limits the size of the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, engineers will meet at NASA headquarters in Washington to discuss how propellant depots could be used to reach farther into space and make possible more ambitious missions using the heavy-lift rocket that NASA is planning to build. The discussions grow out of a six-month NASA study of propellant depots, completed in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the space agency has rejected the study's most radical conclusion: that NASA could forgo the heavy-lift and use existing smaller rockets, combined with fuel depots, to reach its targets more quickly and less expensively. Those targets, for the next two decades at least, include a return to the moon or a visit to an asteroid. (A trip to Mars is unlikely until at least the 2030s.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This study highlights some interesting benefits of depots, but it is too singularly focused,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for NASA's human exploration and operations directorate, said in a statement. ''NASA is actively studying depots and how they can be used with other proposed elements to provide the lowest cost, sustainable exploration plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan outlined in the document, the propellant depot would be launched first, and then other rockets would carry fuel to the depot before a spacecraft arrived to fill up. That would increase the complexity for an asteroid mission -- 11 to 17 launchings instead of four -- but could get NASA astronauts to an asteroid by 2024, the study said. The total budget needed for the project from 2012 through 2030 would be $60 billion to $86 billion, the study said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, a study last year that designed an asteroid mission around a heavy-lift rocket estimated that it would cost $143 billion and that the trip could not happen until 2029. The earlier study briefly considered propellant depots but quickly dismissed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA announced the design of the Space Launch System, the new heavy-lift rocket. The goal is for it to lift 70 metric tons on its first unmanned test flight in 2017, and to be developed into a version capable of lifting 130 tons. The blueprint for NASA's direction for the coming years, passed by Congress last year and signed by President Obama, calls on the agency to develop just that rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the expense of developing and operating the massive new rocket, particularly in an era of tight federal budgets, would doom the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Congressional hearing in July, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, asked Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, about the possibility of depots as an alternative to the Space Launch System. General Bolden said that he did not know details about any propellant depot study, but that his agency had looked at alternatives to building a heavy-lift. ''It turned out that was not as economical, nor as reliable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although General Bolden promised to provide the information, Mr. Rohrabacher said he had obtained the study about propellant depots only through unofficial channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm shocked that the leadership in NASA would try to keep a report as significant as this away from decision makers of the legislative branch,'' Mr. Rohrabacher said, adding that the study gave him ''the ammunition to make a case'' to revisit NASA's plans for human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Propellant depots carry risks, too. Fuels like liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen must be kept at ultracold temperatures and, unless the depots were heavily insulated, would boil away over time. And transferring fuel in the weightlessness of space is not straightforward, although perhaps simply setting the depot and spacecraft into a slow spin would generate enough force to push the fuel into the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a simple thing to transfer cryogenic propellant, on the ground, much less in space,'' said Eugene M. Henderson, an engineer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, who is one of about 20 people who worked on the study. ''It's a big variable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he described the technical challenges as ''fairly trivial'' and said demonstration projects could show that the technology is feasible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- With a ''kiss'' more than 200 miles above Earth, a pair of Chinese spacecraft successfully coupled early Thursday morning, bringing the country one step closer to its four-decade quest for manned space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The docking of the Shenzhou 8 capsule with the Tiangong 1 module was broadcast live on national television. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao watched from the control center in Beijing, and thousands of citizens expressed their pride through Internet postings in what many referred to as the country's first ''space kiss,'' remarking how far China had come since its more impoverished days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming year, officials plan to repeat the unmanned exercise with astronauts as part of its mission to reach the moon and to launch its own space station by 2020. If all goes according to plan, China's floating laboratory would become airborne around the same time the aging International Space Station goes into retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American and Russian aerospace engineers perfected space docking in the 1960s, but Wu Ping, a spokeswoman for China's manned space program, said that Chinese scientists had come to this moment largely on their own, having domestically produced hundreds of components and instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This makes China one of the few countries in the world that can independently research and develop docking mechanisms,'' Ms. Wu said at a news conference on Thursday, describing the achievement as ''a historic breakthrough for our country and a huge technical leap forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Western scientists, however, said the successful mission provided stark evidence that the 20-year-old sanctions that limit cooperation between American and Chinese aeronautical engineers had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy, imposed by Congress shortly after Beijing's violent suppression of pro-democracy protesters in 1989, restricts scientific exchanges and blocks exports of space technology. Chinese scientists are barred from American space conferences, and China is not among the 15 countries whose astronauts are allowed to use the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two decades since it was frozen out of the world's elite space club, China has relied on its own aerospace engineers, aided by lavish government financing, to chase its space exploration dreams. In 2003 came the first successful human space flight, and in recent years Chinese scientists have mastered the manufacture and launching of communication satellites, many of which are sold to nations in the developing world. In 2008, Chinese astronauts took their first spacewalk, and last year China sent up a second lunar probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ominous turn, in 2007 Beijing successfully tested an antisatellite missile that alarmed Washington and angered many international scientists for rendering the target, an aging weather satellite, into potentially dangerous orbital debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Kulacki, China project manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an organization based in Cambridge, Mass., says the Congressional ban on cooperation with China spurs suspicion on both sides of the Pacific and fuels a costly, unnecessary space race. ''When we deny them visas, it breeds hostility among young Chinese scientists,'' he said, adding, ''the lack of cooperation could lead to miscalculations and escalated conflicts in times of crises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, he and other scientists say, cooperation has a multitude of benefits, especially in an era of trillion-dollar deficits. For one, the prohibitive cost of NASA's dreamed mission to Mars would be better shared by other nations, as John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser, has said in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony before a House panel on Wednesday in which he defended his contacts with Chinese officials, Mr. Holdren, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, tried to tamp down Congressional opposition to White House efforts that seek expanded scientific exchanges with China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed out that 30 years of cooperation had brought a multitude of benefits, from physics to pest control. The exchanges, he said, ''strengthen our hand in the effort to get China to change the aspects of its conduct that we oppose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many members of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee, however, were not impressed, citing Beijing's troubled human rights record and a growing number of cases involving technology theft from American companies. ''Any effort on our part to reach out to the Communist Chinese, to engage them on matters of technology is, quite frankly, not just naive but dangerous,'' said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The snubs may sting, but the restrictions do not seem to be holding back China's aerospace industry. In celebrating the successful docking on Thursday, Ms. Wu of China's manned space program said that even if its spacecraft were homemade, China would not exclude other countries from playing a role in its aerospace program. German scientists, she said, had equipped the Shenzhou 8, with a device for conducting experiments. And unlike the International Space Station, China's space laboratory will have no membership restrictions when it becomes operational. ''The planned Chinese space station will be open to global scientists,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bold attempt to revive its long-dormant planetary exploration program, Russia is scheduled to launch a new, technologically sophisticated spacecraft this week to gather soil samples from a Martian moon and bring them back to Earth for analysis. Back in the early 1970's, the Soviet Union, after losing the race to land humans on the Moon, brought back lunar soil samples with robotic devices. It also became the first nation to put robotic devices on Venus and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such pioneering ventures ended after the Soviet Union disintegrated and the economy soured, depriving the space agency of funds. But now Russia is poised to launch a spacecraft that will land on Phobos, a 17-mile-long rock that is the larger of two Martian moons. It will conduct studies there, extract surface materials, put them in a container, and return them to Earth in a small capsule, all in less than three years. Along the way it will drop off a Chinese satellite that will orbit Mars to study its surface, atmosphere, magnetic fields and other processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goal is to learn as much as possible about the composition of Phobos to understand its origins, evolution and relationship to Mars and to the beginnings of the solar system. If the probe finds hydrated rocks or even ice just beneath the crust, that could make Phobos a potential future base camp for astronauts. Phobos has such weak gravity that it would be relatively easy for astronauts to land and take off from the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is a welcome sign that Russia and China, which previously focused on flights closer to Earth, are now interested in planetary expeditions. The American space program, which has studied Mars from satellites and with automated rovers on the surface, will also launch a mission later this month to search the planet's surface for signs of water-containing rocks or other conditions favorable to life. It will be helped by an instrument contributed by Russia, which has an enhanced ability to detect traces of water beneath the surface. This is an arena where the more participants the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's first effort at an interplanetary mission in more than two decades went awry on Wednesday when an unmanned spacecraft failed to take the proper course toward Mars after its launch, space officials said. The Russian space agency chief, Vladimir Popovkin, said an engine failed to fire on the probe, known as Phobos-Soil, after it reached Earth's orbit, the Interfax news agency reported, putting in doubt its mission to bring back a soil sample from the Martian moon Phobos. Mr. Popovkin said officials were in contact with the probe, which remained in Earth's orbit, and had three days to set it on course before the batteries ran out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space engineers scrambled Wednesday to salvage an ambitious science mission to Mars after the unmanned spacecraft became stranded in Earth orbit. If they are not successful, the probe, which is loaded with toxic fuel, could re-enter the atmosphere within days or weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, a high-stakes effort to bring back soil samples from the Martian moon Phobos -- and to return Russia to prominence in planetary exploration after a long dry spell -- was launched from Kazakhstan atop a Zenit rocket early Wednesday. Russian officials said that the launching was normal. But then, once the spacecraft was in orbit, two planned firings of its propulsion system, intended to send it on the nearly yearlong journey to Mars, did not occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The engines did not fire, not the first or the second time,'' said Vladimir Popovkin, director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unnamed person in Russia's space industry told the Interfax news agency that there had been warnings before the launching that glitches in the probe's command and control system had not been fully resolved. ''The risk of failure because of its abnormal operation was very high. Unfortunately, the worst forecasts have come true,'' the person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure left the 30,000-pound, $170 million probe, called Phobos-Grunt -- ''grunt'' being the Russian word for ground -- stuck in an egg-shaped orbit that at its lowest point is just 129 miles above the Earth. The atmosphere, though thin at that altitude, will create enough drag to eventually cause the spacecraft to fall to Earth. When and where that might happen, and how much of the spacecraft might survive a fiery re-entry, is impossible to predict at this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly two-thirds of the spacecraft's weight is in fuels, including hydrazine, which is highly corrosive and toxic. The probe also contains a small amount of radioactive cobalt used in one of its instruments, though that presents no danger, a person at the Kazakhstan launching center told the news agency Ria Novosti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers were waiting to re-establish communication with the probe -- expected early Thursday morning Moscow time -- to send new engine-firing instructions to its computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was no guarantee that the problem was a software one, and the engineers were racing the clock: although the spacecraft has enough power for at least three days and probably longer, the decaying orbit means it could soon reach a point where the engines would not be able to send it away from Earth, said Anatoly Zak, an expert on the Russian space program who tracks the country's efforts at russianspaceweb.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it would help, if asked. ''Should Roscosmos need it, we will do our best to provide the services of the space communications and navigation networks, which support NASA's satellites and spacecraft,'' said Michael J. Braukus, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems with the spacecraft are the latest in a string of troubles for Russia's space efforts, including the failure in August of a Soyuz rocket -- the type that, with the end of the shuttle program, NASA now depends on to send astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. Russian engineers identified and fixed the problem, and a Soyuz rocket is scheduled to be launched Sunday night, ferrying two Russians and an American to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is also scheduled to send its own spacecraft to Mars this month, launching Nov. 25 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. NASA calls its Mars Science Laboratory ''the largest and most capable rover to be sent to another planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phobos-Grunt mission is Russia's first to the vicinity of a planet since a 1996 Mars project, which failed shortly after reaching Earth orbit and broke up over the Pacific. The spacecraft has a small return vehicle that is meant to hold about half a pound of soil samples, plus other instruments and equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at the spacecraft and count the number of instruments on it, very quickly it's apparent that this is a very complex mission,'' said Dwayne A. Day, a space policy analyst at the National Research Council. ''They shot for the sky with this one. So far it's kind of shocking that it ran into problems this early.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Day said that Russia's planetary exploration program had suffered with the country's economic woes. ''The Russian program was pretty much broke in the 1990s and much of the last decade, too,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two things have happened,'' he said. ''Everybody's out of practice -- the last time they built an interplanetary spacecraft was in the early 1990s. The other problem is that they lost a lot of people. They had a brain drain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Day added that the Russian approach of undertaking a large, complex mission after years with no projects at all contrasted sharply with NASA's strategy, which includes some smaller missions. ''Relatively junior people come in and work on these missions that are relatively fast turnaround,'' he said. ''This allows them to gain a lot of experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phobos-Grunt spacecraft is also carrying a 250-pound Chinese satellite that is meant to orbit Mars and study its environment. ''It's interesting that the Chinese were sending along a piggyback payload,'' said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''They have to be disappointed'' that the mission is in jeopardy, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pace said the Chinese had encountered difficulties cooperating with Europe on the Galileo global satellite navigation system, ultimately withdrawing from the project in 2007. And talk of cooperation in space with the United States had generated political controversy in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You wonder what they must be thinking about international cooperation,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes of salvaging an ambitious unmanned mission to Mars dwindled on Thursday, with Russian scientists failing to make contact with a multimillion dollar space probe that stalled in a low-earth orbit after the engines responsible for sending it toward Mars did not fire. Experts said that there was still a small chance the probe's software could be reprogrammed and the mission saved, though there were growing fears that the craft, filled with toxic fuels, could crash to earth within days or weeks. ''With every orbit around the earth, the craft is loosing altitude and speed,'' an official told the news agency Interfax. Officials involved with the space program told Russian news agencies that they made several failed attempts on Thursday to restart the engines on the Phobos-Grunt spacecraft, which was supposed to bring back soil samples from the Martian moon Phobos.</p>
