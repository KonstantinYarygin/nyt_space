<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a fresh NASA remix of Space Station time-lapse imagery, in this case with Peter Gabriel's "Down to Earth," from "Wall-E":</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I encourage you to watch this beautifully produced selection of time-lapse imagery of the Earth recorded by the crew of the International Space Station between August and October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video captures in equal measure the wonders of the physical planet -- including the dancing auroras of both hemispheres -- and the impressive luminosity of humanity in the midst of its fossil-fueled growth spurt. It is indeed a "very small stage in a vast cosmic arena," as Carl Sagan wrote in 1994. But the stage is getting pretty populated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The raw video is available from the Image Science &amp; Analysis Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center, but Michael Konig, a video maker based in Berlin, has added a nice soundtrack and used various techniques to clean up the imagery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, I wrote about similar images recorded by NASA astronaut&nbsp;Donald R. Pettit, including his animation of the aurora borealis. But the new videos are even more spectacular, and inspiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank goodness Congress had the wisdom to include in the Space Act of 1958 a requirement that&nbsp;the new agency communicate its findings to the public.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Russian Soyuz rocket with three astronauts -- two Russians, one American -- is set to lift off from Kazakhstan on Monday morning, ferrying the men to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ordinarily, the launching of a Soyuz, Russia's workhorse rocket for decades, is a mundane event. But this time the future of the space station -- and, indeed, the space programs of Russia and the United States -- may be riding on the mission's success. There are now three crew members living on the space station, and they are scheduled to return to Earth this month; if the three relief astronauts do not arrive before then, the space station will be empty for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight is also the beginning of a new chapter for NASA, which ended its space shuttle program in July and is now turning to foreign governments and commercial enterprises for space transportation. Monday's launching will be the first trip by astronauts to orbit since the retirement of the shuttles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel C. Burbank, Anton N. Shkaplerov and Anatoly A. Ivanishin are scheduled to launch at 10:14 a.m. Monday -- which is 11:14 p.m. Sunday Eastern time -- from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The trip, which was supposed to take place in September, was postponed after the failure in August of a Russian unmanned cargo rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials expressed confidence that their Russian counterparts had diagnosed and corrected the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Russian commission has talked to us and explained the basis for their analysis,'' said William H. Gerstenmaier, associate administrator of NASA's human exploration and operations mission directorate. ''They've done everything we would do to make sure everything is fine, and we're ready to go launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has had a rough year in its space endeavors. The problem in August was that the third stage of the cargo rocket shut down early; instead of reaching orbit, the spacecraft arced into a Siberian forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been two other mishaps. Earlier in August, the failure of an upper stage of a different Russian rocket put a communication satellite in a wrong orbit. And last week, a Russian probe that was supposed to explore a Martian moongot mired in low-Earth orbit after its engines failed to fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The probe, the Phobos-Grunt, is being monitored by Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, which is trying to re-establish contact and set it on course, but the chances for success look slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reliability of rockets has traditionally been a strength of the Russian space program, and the problems with three different rockets this year may indicate underlying issues, said Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now directs the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope there are full and frank discussions going on'' between NASA officials and their Russian colleagues, Dr. Pace said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third stage of the cargo rocket is essentially identical to that of the astronaut-carrying Soyuz, which led Russia to suspend flights as it investigated the crash. Experts concluded that the faulty engine had suffered from a one-time flaw. A cargo rocket was successfully launched for a flight to the space station last month, clearing the way for the resumption of astronaut flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the three men arrive at their destination on Wednesday, the space station will temporarily be back to its full complement of six crew members. But then the three crew members currently in orbit will return to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Soyuz with three more crew members is scheduled to launch next month. ''Once we have the December flight, we're pretty much back on a regular schedule,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said. Much of the scientific research on the station is controlled and monitored on the ground, and the impact of the delays on research was ''modest,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems also pushed back the launching schedule for <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif. -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short. A test flight of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 rocket, which lifts a capsule called the Dragon, was supposed to take place in September, carrying hundreds of pounds of supplies to the space station. But now that mission will not happen until next year. If it succeeds, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will begin regular cargo runs to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Russian engineers continue to try to communicate with the Phobos-Grunt spacecraft launched Wednesday, which was meant to land on the Martian moon Phobos, scoop up some dirt and bring it back to Earth. But Phobos-Grunt -- ''grunt'' means ground in Russian -- remains in orbit after its engines failed to fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If contact cannot be resumed, Phobos-Grunt will fall back to Earth, most likely sometime next month. But predicting the rate of fall of a satellite is a tricky business, said Nicholas Johnson, NASA's chief scientist for space debris. A lot depends on the spacecraft itself -- whether it is tumbling, for instance -- and on how active the Sun is during the weeks in question. A more active Sun causes Earth's atmosphere to puff outward, increasing the drag on satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The spacecraft will likely last into December, potentially even late December,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high point was when I got to bomb Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In science fiction, wars between the Earth and her interplanetary colonies are a staple of the far future, but this was not that. Before we go to war with Mars, there has to be somebody living there to fight. Toward the end of the exhibition ''Beyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration,'' which opens at the American Museum of Natural History on Saturday, a visitor is confronted with a chance to help make the red planet, currently a frozen desert, livable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an interactive screen the size and shape of a Ping-Pong table, you can play God and direct the future evolution of Mars. The first task is to thicken its atmosphere and warm it up by liberating carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from its frozen soil and ice caps. You can bomb the planet -- although, to my disappointment, you can't aim the bombs -- or you can spray black dust on the ice caps to make them absorb sunlight and melt faster. Both of these made me feel like a delightfully naughty 6-year-old boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can even build factories with tall smokestacks billowing exhaust. ''I'm polluting Mars,'' I exclaimed, eliciting sage chuckles from the museum staff members nearby. After all, we've been practicing that for 500 years on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of the space program as a museum show seemed wildly and gloomily appropriate when I first heard about it. We think of museums as being for old dead things, and the space program, at least the American space program, seems ready for its own diorama as the space shuttle shuts down, the Moon landings recede into ancient history, and space science is slowly dismantled by a prairie fire of budget cutting and wild cost overruns in the few programs that are left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily we don't have to relive that. The idea of the exhibition is to look forward 50 or 100 years, not back, said Michael Shara, the curator of the show. ''We're at a crossroads,'' he said. ''We have to decide what to do when we grow up. Where is the vision?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, the vision is solely Dr. Shara's, he admitted, arrived at by picking the brains of space experts. Lest you get too excited, it does not yet represent the official agenda of NASA or any other agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world sorely needs some kind of cosmic blueprint going forward, if indeed we are to go forward and outward, and though one can quibble with many details, this one is as good as any. One can fantasize that this show could have the same long-range impact on shaping public expectations in space as magazine articles and television shows did in the 1950s. In that case, I hope it travels to the other countries that are now flexing their space muscles, like China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who think that human spaceflight is ridiculously expensive, wasteful, dangerous and unscientific -- a group that includes a lot of scientists I know -- might want to stop reading right here. The exhibition plays shamelessly to those of us who were captivated long ago by science fiction dreams and the notion that humanity's destiny is somehow tied to the stars. For the most part these plans don't come with price tags attached nor, for that matter, any indication of what currency the price should be denominated in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somebody will do these things,'' Dr. Shara said. ''Maybe not the U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The times being what they are, there is an iPhone app to go with the show. Point your phone at one of several special stations and extra information is downloaded into your hand; you can collect it and e-mail it. And the exhibits faithfully refer to the eight planets of the solar system -- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- which gives me heartburn every time. In my household, Pluto is still a planet. But this is a quibble compared to the uplift it gives to a weary sci-fi boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True to Dr. Shara's word, the show moves briskly through the past, starting appropriately with the achievements of the old Soviet Union, which launched the first satellite into orbit, sent the first man and woman into space and took the first pictures of the far side of the Moon. It moves on to American space feats: the Moon landings, the shuttle and a mockup of the astronaut John Grunsfeld inserting a new camera into the Hubble Space Telescope back in 2009 -- the real tools he used on that mission are hanging from the dummy's belt. But stop to savor the smell of moon dust (''like spent gunpowder'' according to the Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan) as recreated by NASA chemists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, private industry is beginning to take over what NASA once did. For $200,000 you can book a flight to the edge of space aboard SpaceShipTwo, the spaceplane being developed by Richard Branson's company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sooner or later -- in the year 2030, it says here -- humans will return to that gray, airless landscape. ''Just a three-day trip from Earth by spacecraft, the luminous Moon beckons,'' the show notes in travel-brochure language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We find ourselves in the Shackleton Crater, a depression near the Moon's south pole, where permanent shadows might shield ice left over from primordial comet impacts, making it a likely spot for a Moon base. The lunar inhabitants will keep busy mining helium-3, a rare form of the element useful for fusion reactors. Another chore might be constructing and then tending a telescope a kilometer across whose mirror is made of spinning liquid coated on the surface with gold nanoparticles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will ride around the Moon's surface in a buggy with chain-mail wheels and sleep in balloonlike habitats lofted from Earth and expanded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting there is also going to be interesting. By then, Dr. Shara figures, we will have had enough of the violence of rockets and will descend and ascend from the lunar surface on a lunar elevator, ''a skinny cable rising thousands of miles from the Moon into the sky,'' anchored at the far end by the gravity of the Earth. In time, Dr. Shara said, the cable could be extended almost all the way to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the corner from Shackleton, a scale model of the asteroid Itokawa hangs from the ceiling lumpy and brutish-looking. In 2005 it was visited by a Japanese spacecraft, Hayabusa, which brought back samples. Asteroids, which have been declared a target for deep-space exploration by the Obama administration, represent a sort of alpha and omega of the cosmos. Astronomers think they supplied life-giving water and organic materials to the Earth long ago. Some day in the far future, an asteroid colliding with the Earth could extinguish that life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one more reason to cast our covetous eyes toward Mars, the piece de resistance of possibility in this neighborhood of the cosmos and the longtime caldron of our space fantasies. To me, Mars is the emotional heart, the center of gravity, of the show. There is a psychological test you can take to see if you can tolerate the level of detail, stress and loneliness needed to make the flight there. I failed it miserably. If you get there anyway, you could wear new form-fitting spacesuits that make you look like a superhero -- visitors can pose as if they were wearing one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A full-scale model of the Mars Science Laboratory, a k a Curiosity, the latest rover scheduled to be launched to Mars this month, dominates the scene. Tilted on a red sand dune, it looks like some prehistoric creature with an overdeveloped head browsing the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once we dreamed of flying saucers from Mars; now perhaps Mars dreams of visits from us. Water flowed on Mars in the long past. Now the planet is dry, with an atmosphere about one-150th the pressure of our own. On a good day it resembles Antarctica. Did anything ever live there? Will anything ever live there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some geologists think that Mars could be transformed, or ''terraformed,'' into a livable planet over time in what would be the grandest and most expensive engineering project ever, one that would take thousands of years and entail the Mother of All Environmental Impact Statements and, yes, ''trillions of dollars.'' Only trillions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bombing the planet to thicken its atmosphere was just the beginning; next it would be seeded with bacteria, algae and trees to get the oxygen flowing. At the terraforming table, all my old preadolescent science fiction fantasies came alive again. If it wasn't going to happen in my lifetime, at least it might happen in someone's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everybody agrees that such a scheme would work, nor that we even have the right to do it. We will probably never be able to say there aren't microbes hiding somewhere on Mars -- deep underground, for example. They and whatever evolutionary potential they had would be destroyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Dr. Shara said he strongly suspected that we will terraform Mars. ''It goes with the human propensity for expansionism, colonization, the need to be real estate developers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, of course, with flowers blooming on Mars and settlers abandoning their domes to live under the open sky, we are thousands of years into the future. But the journey has still only begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step ''Star Trek'' style into the hologram at the end of the exhibit and you are surrounded by a thousand points of light that represent the first thousand stars found by NASA's Kepler spacecraft to have planets. Kepler is still only beginning its planet-hunting work. There are surely many more planets in the Milky Way that could be used as steppingstones, to expand into deeper and deeper space over the eons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's where we can go, where we should go, if we have the nerve,'' Dr. Shara said, ''and the focus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Beyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration'' is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Nov. 19 through Aug. 12, 2012, at the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, in Manhattan.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on Wednesday to four American astronauts, including the first American man to orbit the Earth and the crew of the first mission to land on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts, Neil A. Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and John Glenn, received the medal, the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, in a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Congress approved legislation to award the astronauts the medals in 2009, the 40th anniversary of the moon landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, was the first man to walk on the moon, followed by Mr. Aldrin, the spacecraft's lunar module pilot. Mr. Collins was the command module pilot and remained in orbit during the mission. Mr. Glenn became the first American to circle the Earth in space in 1962 aboard the Friendship 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the awards ceremony, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said the men were "genuine national heroes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, said the missions "changed the course of history." Mr. Bolden praised the men for their bravery and for blazing a trail for future astronauts, as the space agency explores sending humans deeper into space, including Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we embark upon the next great chapter of human space exploration, we stand on the shoulders of the extraordinary men we recognize today," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ceremony for the astronauts, now in their 80s and 90s, was attended by Mark E. Kelly, the former astronaut who commanded the shuttle Endeavor's last mission to the International Space Station this summer and is married to Representative Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who was wounded in the Tuscon shootings in January. The singer Norah Jones also attended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the NASA administrator, he is Charles F. Bolden, Jr., not John.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's last two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, launched in 2003 and carried solar panels, but the new Mars rover that the space agency is scheduled to launch on Saturday morning from Cape Canaveral uses nuclear power, a fact that did not escape the partisans of nuclear power here on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it turns out that both nuclear power and solar power in space have problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solar panels on Spirit and Opportunity are gallium-arsenide, a chemistry that is used on Earth but is a niche product, where very high production per square inch is required. Per unit energy produced, if rooftop space is not an issue, silicon-based cells are far less expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar power worked acceptably on Mars, but with some difficulties. Dust storms sometimes blotted out 90 percent of the sun's light, and dust collected on the panels themselves; project scientists referred to "cleaning events" when some kind of wind current reduced the dust coating on the cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirit, which is no longer operating, and Opportunity, which has defied all expectations and is still in service after seven and a half Earth years, weighed about 400 pounds each, and carried lithium-ion batteries so they could store the output of their cells, which was, at maximum, 140 watts. On earth, that amount of power is almost enough to run a desktop computer and monitor, but on Mars it was enough to run the radios, cameras and various instruments, and propel the vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity, the Mars rover that is scheduled for launch on Saturday, weighs about 2,000 pounds. "This is a much larger vehicle, the size of a small car,'' said Stephen G. Johnson, the director of the space nuclear systems and technologies division at the Idaho National Laboratory, which prepared the nuclear power pack for the new probe. And it carries a laser that will be used to zap rocks, so that other instruments can analyze what they are made of. So its energy requirements are far higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really only possible with plutonium 238 to do what it's intending to do,'' said Dr. John M. Logsdon, a space expert at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity is supposed to run for one Martian year, or two Earth years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity carries a nuclear power pack that can generate 110 watts, continuously. But this is not like a nuclear reactor on Earth, which splits uranium atoms to make heat, uses the heat to boil water and uses the steam to drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space nuclear power packs are not reactors at all; they do not split atoms. They carry plutonium 238, a manufactured isotope with a half-life of just 88 years, which means that its radioactive decay is so fast that it glows red-hot. The heat is converted directly to electricity. The radioactive emissions are alpha particles, which are easily blocked, and the material cannot be used in a bomb, although the technology needed to purify the plutonium 238 can also be used to recover the type of plutonium that is weapons-usable. And the material is toxic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that in the United States, all things nuclear are getting old. The United States stopped making plutonium 238 in the late 1980s, when the Energy Department shut down the reactors at the Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C., which it was using for production of various radioactive materials, including tritium for nuclear weapons. Since then, the United States has bought plutonium 238 from Russia, but that country no longer makes it, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2009 report by the National Academy of Sciences called for restarting production, but this has not been done, mostly for cost reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One alternative is to develop a better way to convert heat into electricity in space. The National Academy report said that the method NASA uses now is only about 6 percent efficient. A Stirling Engine system could produce five times as much electricity from each unit of heat, reducing the need for plutonium, but it has many moving parts and has not been adapted to space use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the response so far has been to use solar cells whenever possible. Steven W. Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell who is the chief scientist for the Opportunity and Spirit rovers, said: "You always use solar when you can; it's simpler, cheaper, just easier to do. You only use nuclear when you have to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, NASA launched another space ship, Juno, on a mission to Jupiter. Because of the shortage of plutonium, it uses solar cells, although the neighborhood is not conducive to that technology. At the orbit of Jupiter, five times as far from the sun as the Earth is, the sun's intensity is 96 percent lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restarting production of plutonium 238 and finding a more efficient way to use it are urgent priorities, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no cows on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of that, planetary scientists are certain, which leaves them puzzling over what could be producing methane gas detected in the thin Martian air. Methane molecules are easily blown apart by ultraviolet light from the Sun, so any methane around must have been released recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the gas be burbling from something alive? Cows, after all, burp methane on Earth. Other creatures, including a class of micro-organisms that live without oxygen, also produce methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration could get some answers soon. On the launching pad at Cape Canaveral in Florida is a spacecraft, the Mars Science Laboratory, that is scheduled to lift off on Saturday and reach Mars next August. It will deliver an S.U.V.-size rover named Curiosity that carries an instrument that can detect methane in the air, and if it does, it will unleash new excitement about the prospect of life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Based on evidence, what we do have is, unequivocally, the conditions for the emergence of life were present on Mars -- period, end of story,'' said Michael J. Mumma, a senior scientist for NASA at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who led one of three teams that have made still-controversial claims of detecting methane in Mars's atmosphere. ''So life certainly could have arisen there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mars is smaller than Earth, it cooled faster, and it probably would have been hospitable for life earlier. That raises the intriguing possibility that pieces of Mars containing microbes were blasted into space by asteroid impacts and later landed on Earth, seeding life here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: we could all be descendants of Martians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of Martians has long fueled the imagination of Earthlings, from the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom novels to the canals Percival Lowell deluded himself into seeing through his telescope to ''War of the Worlds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other times, the pendulum swung back the other way. Mariner 4, the first space probe to whiz past Mars, in 1965, sent back pictures not of verdant forests, but of barren rocks. And NASA's two Viking landers in 1976, equipped with sophisticated life chemistry experiments, analyzed the soil and found it devoid of the organic building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars, it appeared in 1976, was really most sincerely dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things looked so grim for exobiology on Mars,'' said Christopher F. Chyba, a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University. ''We made this tremendous investment in two Viking landers. There was a backlash of the people who felt the biology was oversold and premature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA subsequently played down the notion of life on Mars and instead set out on a methodical campaign to explore the past geology and climate of Mars. Although Mars today looks dry and cold -- dead -- geological markings like gullies, dry lake beds and colossal canyons point to a liquid past. ''Follow the water'' became the mantra. NASA's last two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, found convincing evidence of environments that were habitable in the distant past. Curiosity will go further, looking for carbon-based molecules, including methane, that are the building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent orbital images show that water might still occasionally flow on the surface of Mars. New knowledge about life on Earth and how it can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, like the dark, boiling waters near ocean-bottom volcanic vents, also made scientists less dismissive of the notion that life persists on Mars. In 1996, a team of NASA scientists announced that they had found fossilized microbes in a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica. Those claims remain at least as controversial as the methane findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But short of photographing a cow or some other life form ambling among the rocks, Curiosity is not going to discover life. As with every NASA probe since the Viking landers, Curiosity is not carrying experiments designed to tell whether the building blocks of life ever came together to form life. If there are microbial Martians thriving in the soil, Curiosity will not see them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think we've put down enough groundwork,'' said Michael A. Meyer, NASA's lead scientist for Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is frustrating in particular for Gilbert V. Levin, who believes that his experiment on the Vikings 35 years ago, designed to detect life, did indeed detect life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drops of a nutrient solution containing radioactive carbon-14 were added to Martian soil, and a stream of radioactive carbon dioxide was detected rising out of the soil. That is what would be expected from micro-organisms eating the food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To rule out the possibility that a nonbiological chemical process was generating the carbon dioxide, other samples were heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit to sterilize them. No radioactive carbon dioxide was seen rising from those when the nutrient drops were added, fitting with the hypothesis that the heat had killed the Martian microbes. If a nonbiological process were at play, the radioactive carbon dioxide should have been seen after the sterilization as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other Viking experiments had failed to measure any organic molecules, so Dr. Levin's results -- even though they matched exactly what would be expected for life -- were like announcing the discovery of a brick house in the absence of bricks. The consensus was that the claim was mistaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent discovery, however, offers a possible explanation for how Dr. Levin could be right after all. In 2008, NASA's Phoenix landerfound chemicals known as perchlorates in the Martian soil. Viking's organic molecule detector heated the soil to release organics. But heating organic molecules in the presence of perchlorates destroys them, so even if they were there, Viking's experiment may have missed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levin said a more sophisticated version of his experiment, weighing a couple of pounds and costing a few million dollars, could definitively validate or disprove the Viking results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But they won't fly it,'' Dr. Levin said. ''Changing a paradigm is a tough thing. We've run this experiment thousands of times on Earth. It's never given a false positive. It's never given a false negative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two lander missions that are to follow Curiosity -- collaborations between NASA and the European Space Agency -- do not have a version of Dr. Levin's experiment planned. Christopher E. Carr, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is intrigued by the possibility that life on Earth could have started on Mars, has proposed an even more ambitious experiment: send a DNA sequencer to Mars. That, too, has yet to find a mission to fly on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Definitive answers may have to wait until a mission that brings Mars rocks back for study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that may be a very long wait. The Obama administration, mindful of tight federal budgets, has yet to give the green light on the lander missions, scheduled for 2016 and 2018, and is considering canceling them. Curiosity may be the last spacecraft landing on Mars for many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would derail the whole search for life, either extinct or extant, on Mars,'' Dr. Mumma said. ''That would be a disaster.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- What does Goldilocks want?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least four times in the last few years, astronomers have announced they have found planets orbiting other stars in the sweet spot known as the habitable zone -- not too hot, not too cold -- where water and thus perhaps life are possible. In short, a so-called Goldilocks planet fit to be inhabited by the biochemical likes of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these claims are without controversy, but astronomers who are making discoveries with NASA's Kepler spacecraft are meeting next week in California to review the first two years of their quest, which seems tantalizingly close to hitting pay dirt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sooner or later, Kepler will find a lukewarm planet with a size making it probably Earthlike,'' said Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, who spends his time tracking down candidates identified by Kepler. ''We're no more than a year away'' from such a discovery, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planetary astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it this way: ''We are on the verge of being those people who will be remembered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this has brought to the fore a question long debated by geologists, chemists, paleontologists and cosmologists turned astrobiologists, namely: What does life really need to get going, flourish and evolve on some alien rock?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer depends of course on whom we expect to be living there. We might dream of green men with big eyes, ants with hive minds, or even cuddly octopuses as an antidote to cosmic loneliness, but what we are most likely to find, a growing number of scientists say, is alien pond slime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microbes can spring up anywhere that is wet and warm, astronomers say, although biologists are not so sanguine. But the emergence of large creatures, let alone intelligent ones, as evidenced by the history of the Earth, depends on a chain of events and accidents -- from asteroid strikes to plate tectonics -- that are unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. ''If you reran Earth's history, how many times would you get animals?'' asked Donald Brownlee, an astronomer at the University of Washington. He and a colleague, the paleontologist Peter Ward, made a case that we live on a lucky planet in their 1999 book, ''Rare Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-cell life might be common, given the right simple conditions, explained Dr. Marcy in an e-mail. ''But the steady, long-term evolution toward critters that play improv saxophone, write alliteration poems, and build heavy-lifting rocket boosters may depend on a prohibitive list of planetary prerequisites,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even warm and wet is a rare condition, however, occurring now on only one of the eight official planets in our solar system and three of the several dozen moons. Mars was once wet, but it is now a desert. And after billions of dollars spent exploring Mars and the remains of space probes littering the planet, we still do not know if a single microbe ever lived there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody really knows how rare or common are planets like Earth and its brand of life. ''I would be more comfortable with that argument if it were not so Earth-o-centric,'' Steven Benner, a chemist at the Foundation for Molecular Evolution, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, he said, low-temperature water mixed with ammonia can substitute for water alone as the liquid necessary for life. So could liquid methane, which forms lakes on Titan, Saturn's slushy frigid moon, and Dr. Benner and others have advocated looking for life there. ''We are limited by our imaginations,'' said Natalie Batalha, a leader of the Kepler team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists deplore the emphasis on animals like us, saying it is hopelessly parochial and unimaginative -- the scientific equivalent of the drunk searching for his car keys under a street light because that's where the light is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Animals are overgrown microbes,'' said Paul Falkowski, a biophysicist and biologist from Rutgers. ''We are here to ferry microbes across the planet. Plants and animals are an afterthought of microbes.'' So, we should hardly be disappointed if we find our neighbors are microbes. After all, on Earth, microbes were the whole story for almost four billion years, paleontologists say, and now inhabit our intestines as well as every doorknob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov, an astronomer turned astrobiologist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said he was all for the existence of a microbial planet. ''Don't assume microbes are simple,'' he said, noting that 99 percent of the genes in our bodies belong to microbes inhabiting us and without which we could not live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for Goldilocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blue-ribbon committee of chemists convened by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there was only one ironclad requirement for life, besides energy: a place warm enough for chemical reactions to go on. So, determining how warm a planet's atmosphere keeps it -- through assumptions, calculations or just plain guesses -- has been crucial in reaching a verdict about its potential habitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how it has gone with the potential Goldilocks planets orbiting Gliese 581, a small cool red star about 20 light-years from here in the constellation Libra that has been at the center of exoplanet fantasies and speculation for the last few years. Depending on whom you talk to, it has five or six planets, three of which have at one time or another been claimed to be habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first in what would become a chain of potential Goldilocks planets, identified in 2007, was a presumably rocky ball about five times as massive as the Earth and orbiting only about seven million miles from Gliese 581, close enough within the small star's shrunken habitable zone to have a warm surface. ''On the treasure map of the universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X,'' Xavier Delfosse, one of the astronomers who discovered it, said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before budding interstellar explorers could even begin conceiving of booking passage to Gliese 581c, as the planet is poetically called, other astronomers took a closer look and concluded that if the planet's geology and atmosphere resembled those of Earth, it would be a stifling greenhouse, no place to set solar sail for. Attention then shifted to a farther planet in the system, Gliese 581d, which had been dismissed as too cold. Could the same greenhouse effect that would torch the inner planet thaw the outer one and make it livable? The answer was yes, but only if it had ''loads of carbon dioxide'' and an atmosphere seven times thicker than Earth's, said Lisa Kaltenegger, a climate modeler at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. Otherwise it would be freezing cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile yet another planet was claimed for that system, smack between the other two, by a team led by R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution and Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz. ''This is really the first Goldilocks planet,'' Dr. Butler said at a news conference last year organized by the National Science Foundation in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Geneva team that had discovered the earlier Gliese 581 planets could not find any evidence of the new planet's existence in their own data. For now, anyway, most astronomers have dismissed that planet. Pending the publication of new results by the Geneva team -- one of the most prolific in the planet-hunting business -- Dr. Butler said, ''We are in a holding pattern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, what some astronomers called the best and smallest Goldilocks candidate yet was announced by the Geneva team. About 3.6 times as massive as the Earth, it circles a faint orange star in Vela known as HD 85512 at a distance of some 24 million miles, about a quarter of the Earth's distance from the Sun. Dr. Kaltenegger and her colleagues calculated that this planet would be habitable if it had an Earth-type geology and at least 50 percent cloud cover. ''So, so far we only have two great targets to search for atmospheric signatures of life,'' Dr. Kaltenegger wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So goes the history of astrobiology, as well as its future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, as many astronomers point out, is getting any more information about these planets. ''Astronomers are going to have to learn to live with ignorance,'' Dr. Seager said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some exoplanets, like the Gliese worlds, were discovered by the ''wobble method'' -- looking at the motions they induce in their parent stars -- which allows their masses and orbits to be measured. Other planets, like the ones identified by Kepler, are found by watching for the blinks when they pass in front of their stars; that also allows their sizes to be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, if, if</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, none of the Goldilocks candidates have been observed to transit their stars, and thus none have been assigned both masses and sizes, which would allow astronomers to calculate their densities and compositions and find out if they are water worlds, rocks or gassy fluff balls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler fixes its gaze on a patch of stars in Cygnus that are hundreds if not thousands of light-years away -- too far for any wobble detections that would assess the abundance of Earthlike planets in the galaxy or any other close scrutiny. We are liable to never know anymore about those planets than we know now, astronomers say. The brute reality, astronomers admit, is that even if there are thousands or millions of habitable planets in the galaxy, only a few hundred of them are within range of any telescope that will be built in the conceivable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily there is some renewed hope for life on those nearby planets. David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics runs a project called MEarth that looks for planets around nearby stars. He pointed out that of the 300 stars within 25 light-years of here, 260 are red dwarfs like Gliese 581.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently it was thought that habitable-zone planets around such stars would have to hug the star so closely that they would be tidally locked, like the Moon, keeping one face locked to the star and roasting, the other freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new studies have concluded that a proper atmosphere could spread the heat around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is good. ''These stars,'' Dr. Charbonneau said, ''are our only hope for studying life in the universe in the coming decades.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the original scheme of things, Kepler was to be succeeded by a space observatory called the Terrestrial Planet Finder, which would be big enough to find and study planets up to 100 light-years distant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But plans for that telescope have collapsed, because of NASA's continuing fiscal woes and disagreements among astronomers, as well as the technological challenges involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers hope that some of these functions can be performed by the James Webb Space Telescope -- NASA's Hubble successor, overdue and over budget, now scheduled for a launch in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a ''starshade'' that would blot out the glare of a planet's sun, the Webb could detect and study the pinpoint of light from an exoplanet itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the starshade would be hostage to the same political and fiscal pressures that are threatening to decimate NASA's scientific programs. At best, scientists say, the search for life elsewhere has been postponed for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm beginning to despair that I will see it in my lifetime,'' said James Kasting of Pennsylvania State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geology Is Destiny</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth got lucky early. Fossil evidence suggests that microbial life was already inhabiting the Earth as early as 3.8 billion years ago -- only 700 million years after the planet collapsed into existence, and a geological instant after the end of a rain of comets and asteroids that brought just the right amount of precious water in the form of ice from the outer solar system to what would otherwise be a dry planet, astronomers say. ''The question of whether the Earth is unique because of its water abundance is perhaps the most interesting one in the arsenal of Rare Earth arguments,'' said Dr. Kasting, who explained that calculations showed that the planet could have easily had too much or too little water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet has remained comfortable ever since thanks to a geological feedback process, by which weather, oceans and volcanoes act as a thermostat. Known as the carbonate silicate cycle, it regulates the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it acts like a greenhouse -- trapping heat and keeping the planet temperate and mostly stable. Rain washes the gas out of the air and under the ocean; volcanoes disgorge it again from the underworld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without greenhouse gases and this cycle -- which Dr. Brownlee called ''this magic thing'' -- the Earth would have frozen into a snowball back in its early days when the Sun was only 70 percent as bright as it is now. Still, with all this magic, it took four billion years for animal life to appear on the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seeds for animal life were sown sometime in the dim past when some bacterium learned to use sunlight to split water molecules and produce oxygen and sugar -- photosynthesis, in short. The results began to kick in 2.4 billion years ago when the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere began to rise dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Oxidation Event, as it is called in geology, ''was clearly the biggest event in the history of the biosphere,'' said Dr. Ward from Washington. It culminated in what is known as the Cambrian explosion, about 550 million years ago, when multicellular creatures, that is to say, animals, appeared in sudden splendiferous profusion in the fossil record. We were off to the Darwinian races. Whatever happened to cause this flowering of species helped elevate Earth someplace special, say the Rare Earthers. Paleontologists argue about whether it could have been a spell of bad climate known as Snowball Earth, the breakup of a previous supercontinent, or something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, alien planets that have been lucky enough to be habitable in the first place might have to be lucky again. ''The big hurdle'' for other planets, said Dr. Brownlee, is to have some event or series of events to trigger their own ''Cambrian-like'' explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually though, Earth's luck will run out. As the Sun ages it will get brighter, astronomers say, increasing the weathering and washing away of carbon dioxide. At the same time, as the interior of the Earth cools, volcanic activity will gradually subside, cutting off the replenishing of the greenhouse gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A billion years from now, Dr. Brownlee said, there will not be enough carbon dioxide left to support photosynthesis, that is to say, the oxygen we breathe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so much for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even Earth, wonderful and special as it is, will only have animal life for one billion years,'' Dr. Brownlee said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't get too close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are reporting that they have taken the measure of the biggest, baddest black holes yet found in the universe, abyssal yawns 10 times the size of our solar system into which billions of Suns have vanished like a guilty thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such holes, they say, might be the gravitational cornerstones of galaxies and clues to the fates of violent quasars, the almost supernaturally powerful explosions in the hearts of young galaxies that dominated the early years of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of these newly surveyed monsters, which weighs as much as 21 billion Suns, is in an egg-shaped swirl of stars known as NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in a sprawling cloud of thousands of galaxies about 336 million light-years away in the Coma constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other black hole, a graveyard for the equivalent of 9.7 billion Suns, more or less, lurks in the center of NGC 3842, a galaxy that anchors another cluster known as Abell 1367, about 331 million light-years away in Leo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are the most massive reliably measured black holes ever,'' Nicholas J. McConnell, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail, referring to the new observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These results are more than just cool and record-setting. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope over the years have shown that such monster black holes seem to inhabit the centers of all galaxies -- the bigger the galaxy, the bigger the black hole. Researchers said the new work could shed light on the role these black holes play in the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous record-holder was in the galaxy M87, a member of the Virgo cluster some 54 million light-years from here, where a black hole weighed in at a mere 6.3 billion solar masses. The new black holes, however, were even larger than astronomers had predicted based on the earlier measurements, suggesting that there is something special about how the most massive galaxies are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Measurements of these massive black holes will help us understand how their host galaxies were assembled, and how the holes achieved such monstrous mass,'' Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell and his thesis adviser, Chung-Pei Ma, led a team of astronomers who used telescopes in Hawaii, Texas and outer space to weigh the black holes in the centers of galaxies by clocking the speeds of stars zooming around them; the faster the stars are going, the more gravity -- and thus mass -- is needed to keep the stars from flying away. They report their work in the journal Nature, which will be published online on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Rees, a cosmologist at Cambridge University, called the new work ''an incremental step,'' noting that the study of these monsters has been a part of his life for a long time. ''It's good to learn about even bigger ones,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes, regions of space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from it, are among the weirdest of the predictions of Albert Einstein's curved-space theory of gravity, general relativity -- so weird that Einstein himself did not believe it. He once wrote to a friend that there ought to be a law of nature forbidding such a thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was wrong. And some of his successors, like Dr. Rees and a colleague at Cambridge, Stephen Hawking, have spent their careers studying the implications for physics of objects that can wrap spacetime around themselves like a magician's cloak and disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is the fate, astronomers agree, of some massive stars once they run out of fuel and collapse upon themselves. Indeed the galaxy is littered with stellar-mass black holes detectable by the X-rays spit by doomed matter swirling around them like water in a drain. And there seem to be giant ones in the heart of every galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One question astronomers would like answered is how these black holes got so big, billions of times bigger than a typical dead star. Dr. Ma described it as a kind of nature-versus-nurture argument, explaining that black holes could grow by merging with other black holes as galaxies merge to get bigger -- ''nature'' -- or by swallowing gas around them -- ''nurture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bit like asking: Are taller children produced by taller parents or by eating a lot of spinach?'' Dr. Ma wrote in an e-mail. ''For black holes we are not sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also think the supermassive black holes in galaxies could be the missing link between the early universe and today. In the early days of the universe, quasars, thought to be powered by giant black holes in cataclysmic feeding frenzies, were fountaining energy into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where are those quasars now? The new work supports a growing suspicion that those formerly boisterous black holes are among us now, but, having stopped their boisterous growth, are sleeping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell said, ''Our discovery of extremely massive black holes in the largest present-day galaxies suggests that these galaxies could be the ancient remains of voracious ancestors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's try not to awaken them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Thank you for holding, our operators are no longer broke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers announced Monday that they had taken E.T. off hold and resumed searching for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations with a set of radio telescopes in Hat Creek, Calif. The project, part of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, was suspended in April when the University of California's Hat Creek Observatory ran out of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers from the SETI Institute had been using an innovative set of radio telescopes known as the Allen Telescope Array to try to listen in on alien broadcasts from the raft of planets newly found by NASA's Kepler satellite. Under a new deal -- as well as a public fund-raising effort that netted $200,000 -- the SETI astronomers will share the telescopes with the Air Force, which is interested in using them to track satellites and space junk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 6:18 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Monday, when the stars in Kepler's field of view rose in Hat Creek, the array was back on the job, looking for what Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute here called ''technosignatures'' of any inhabitants of those planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know there are planets there,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SETI's resurrection was announced at the start of a weeklong conference here devoted to results from the Kepler satellite, which is conducting a cosmic Gallup poll to determine the fraction of stars that harbor habitable, Earth-like planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overflow crowd of more than 500 astronomers signed up, and they got their money's worth in the first hour: William Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, reported that Kepler had confirmed its first ''Goldilocks'' planet, one that orbits its star in the so-called habitable zone -- the right distance from its star to have liquid water on its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 22b, as it is known, is 2.4 times the size of the Earth and about 600 light years from here. It takes 290 days to orbit its star, which is slightly smaller and dimmer than the Sun. Mr. Borucki said that if it had a reasonable atmosphere, the surface temperature on 22b would be about 72 degrees Fahrenheit, ''a very pleasant temperature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whether Kepler 22b is actually habitable depends on its composition and atmosphere, neither of which is known. Kepler finds planets by detecting starblinks when planets pass in front of their own stars; this allows astronomers to measure the sizes of the planets, relative to that of their home stars, but not their masses and thus their densities and compositions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of Kepler 22b, however, puts it in a class of planets known as super Earths, about which little is known since there is no planet in that range in our own solar system. It could be mostly rock, making it about 13 times the mass of the Earth, or it could be mostly gas, like Neptune. Probably, it is somewhere in between, said Mr. Borucki, adding, ''We have no planets like this in the solar system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did say that because there could be water there, Kepler 22b was a good target for SETI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bounty hardly stops there. Natalie Batalha, Kepler's deputy science team leader and a professor at San Jose State University, unleashed an avalanche of new planet candidates, bringing Kepler's potential bounty to 2,326 exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system. Among them, she said, are 207 objects that are about the size of the Earth and 680 others up to 10 times the size of Earth, or super Earths. In all, 48 of the putative planets are in the Goldilocks zone, Dr. Batalha said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so there are plenty of targets for the re-energized Allen Array, named for Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who paid for the array of 42 telescopes. Dr. Tarter said that the SETI effort needed about $100,000 a month to keep operating and that in the long run, the Air Force money would not be enough to keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are going to need public support,'' she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SAM GROBART   </div><div>593 words</div><div>12 December 2011</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, I still don't get 3-D TV. I mean, I understand it, but I fail to see the appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Solar Walk, a $3 astronomy app for Apple iOS devices that can work in concert with 3-D televisions, I'm prepared to make an exception. More on that in a minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outer space was a big deal to me when I was growing up. I lived a few blocks from a planetarium. And once I was old enough to head out and do stuff on my own, I pretty much spent my time there (I know - sexy), head pointed ceilingwards as I took in yet another space show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My planetarium got rebuilt years ago and is now way too high-tech and shiny for me to properly enjoy (I like my planetariums like I like my episodes of "Breaking Bad" - as dark as possible).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, Solar Walk, designed by the same people who created the stargazing app Star Walk, nails this pitch-black aesthetic, right down to the mystical Kitaro/Vangelis-sounding soundtrack that plays in the background while you pinch and swipe your way through the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet's moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When viewing Earth, you can also check the position of 10 satellites. Zoom in to pull up information about the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope or less-famous craft like the Koronas-Foton satellite from Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar Walk also provides access to short movies about celestial and terrestrial activity. The commuter train may not be a sky theater, but travel time can still be used to learn about things like tidal phenomena and the relative sizes of the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.K, so what does all this have to do with 3-D TV?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar Walk supports Apple's AirPlay mirroring feature, which allows you (if you have an iPad 2 or an iPhone 4S) to stream exactly what you are looking at on your device to an Apple TV-equipped television. Now you're not viewing at the rings of Saturn on a 3.5- or 10-inch screen, but on serious double-digit real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you happen to own a 3-D TV, you can set the app to send a 3-D image to your display (this also works on iOS devices themselves) and, with the requisite 3-D glasses, watch satellites and moons whip around in front of you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is viewing an iOS astronomy app while wearing 3-D goggles the height of nerdiness? Oh, absolutely. It's also one of the most fun things you can do this side of an encounter with a Carl Zeiss Mark IX Universarium (you mean you don't keep up with the latest in large-dome planetarium projectors?). And where the Zeiss Mark IX costs more than $3 million, Solar Walk can give you a similar experience for three bucks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the richest men in the world is going to build the biggest airplane ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he is going to use it to launch rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul G. Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, said Tuesday that he was entering the rocket business with a concept seldom used until now: a plane that can take off the conventional way and then, at 30,000 feet, launch a rocket to orbit, carrying with it satellites, supplies and -- eventually -- people. The first rocket launching could be as soon as 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have a certain number of dreams in your life that you want to fulfill,'' said Mr. Allen, an avid philanthropist who has also financed efforts like a radio telescope listening for alien transmissions, ''and this is a dream that I'm very excited about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airplane that his new company, Stratolaunch Systems, plans to build will be larger and heavier than the Spruce Goose, Howard Hughes's record-setting flying boat that flew, just once, in 1947. With wings that will stretch 385 feet -- longer than a football field -- it will dwarf the double-decker Airbus A380, which is the biggest commercial passenger plane flown today. It will take off from a runway, fly to a normal cruising altitude and then drop off a rocket, eliminating the need for costly launching pads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With government-funded spaceflight diminishing, there is a much expanded opportunity for privately funded efforts,'' Mr. Allen said. He noted that NASA had ended its space shuttle program this year, scrapped plans to return to the Moon and begun relying solely on Russia for launching astronauts to the International Space Station. He said his new effort would help keep ''keep America at the forefront of space exploration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen thus joins the ranks of tycoons who are placing big bets on the heavens. The most prominent is Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic subsidiary is planning to fly tourists on short jaunts to the edge of space. Other big names are Elon Musk, who used his fortune as a founder of Paypal to establish <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a rocket maker that is racking up contracts with NASA, and Jeffrey P. Bezos, the <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> founder, who has a space company called Blue Origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen was actually at the forefront of the billionaire space enthusiasts. A decade ago, he and Burt Rutan, a legendary aerospace engineer who, among many triumphs, built the first airplane to fly around the world without stopping or refueling, teamed up to create SpaceShipOne, the first private manned rocket to reach space, in 2004. That won the $10 million Ansari X Prize, which had been offered as an incentive to push innovative space technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But afterward, Mr. Allen receded from the space limelight as Mr. Rutan worked on a larger version of SpaceShipOne for Mr. Branson's Virgin Galactic, which will launch out of a newly built spaceport in New Mexico, maybe by late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Volume space tourism, I'd leave it to someone like Richard who knew how to pull that off,'' Mr. Allen said. ''To me, the exciting thing would be go all the way to orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new project draws in a mixture of space industry people, old and new. Mr. Musk's company -- the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- will build the rockets that Stratolaunch plans to launch. Michael D. Griffin, a former NASA administrator who has been supportive but skeptical of the emerging commercial space industry, will be on Stratolaunch's board of directors. Stratolaunch will have headquarters in Huntsville, Ala., which is known as ''the Rocket City'' because of its role in the history of spaceflight, and an aircraft hangar in Mojave, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen is the sole investor, putting only his own money at risk. He declined to say how much he planned to spend. ''Obviously, this is not inexpensive,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new company aims to use the same strategy that won the X Prize, and supersize it. For the X Prize, he and Mr. Rutan took a rocket called SpaceShipOne, slung beneath a carrier airplane, and lofted it high into the sky before launching it, with a pilot on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, the carrier airplane will have six 747 engines and a gross weight of more than 1.2 million pounds. It will use a 12,000-foot runway. By getting rid of the specialized launching pads used by NASA and other space agencies, Stratolaunch officials say they will be able to reduce costs, offer more flexibility and avoid bad weather by simply flying their airborne launcher to a patch of clear sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that Mr. Rutan founded, Scaled Composites, will build the airplane. Mr. Rutan, who retired this year, did the preliminary designs and will act as an adviser, but current Scaled employees will perform most of the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rutan said that Scaled Composites, which is tiny compared with companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Airbus, will able to build such a huge airplane because it is designing and building only the airframe. Other components like the engines, electronics and landing gear will be scavenged from second-hand 747s. ''The things that are most difficult, we're not developing,'' he said. ''We're just bolting them in as things that have millions of hours of airline service.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a tiny space plane like SpaceShipOne, Stratolaunch's carrier airplane will cradle a full-size rocket, a variant of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9, weighing about half a million pounds. The plane will take the rocket to 30,000 feet, almost six miles high, and then drop it. The rocket's engines will then ignite and the tail fins will turn the rocket's direction upward. The airplane will return to the airport and, in a quick turnaround, could be ready to launch another rocket by the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payload capacity will be about 13,500 pounds to low-Earth orbit -- less than the Falcon 9 and other larger rockets like the Atlas V and Delta IV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Stratolaunch will aim to carry smaller satellites like NASA science probes. ''This is obviously a big initial investment,'' Mr. Allen said, ''that we wouldn't be making if we didn't think they were going to be a lot customers out there, both for cargo and manned missions in the future.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what amounts to a kind of holiday gift to the cosmos, astronomers from NASA's Kepler spacecraft announced Tuesday that they had discovered a pair of planets the size of Earth orbiting a distant star. The new planets, one about as big as Earth and the other slightly smaller than Venus, are the smallest yet found beyond the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the discovery showed that Kepler could indeed find planets as small as our own and was an encouraging sign that planet hunters would someday succeed in the goal of finding Earth-like abodes in the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first Jupiter-size exoplanets, as they are known, were discovered nearly 15 years ago, astronomers have been chipping away at the sky, finding smaller and smaller planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are finally there,'' said David Charbonneau, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was a member of the team that made the observations, led by his colleague Francois Fressin. The team reported its results in an online news conference Tuesday and in a paper being published in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fressin said, ''This demonstrates for the first time that Earth-size planets exist around other stars and that we can detect them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement doubled the number of known Earth-size planets in the galaxy to four from two -- Earth and Venus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next major goal in the planetary hunt, astronomers say, is to find an Earth-size planet in the so-called Goldilocks zone of a star, where conditions are temperate for water and thus life. We are not there yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two new planets, Kepler 20e and Kepler 20f, are far outside the Goldilocks zone -- so close to the star, termed Kepler 20, that one of them is roasting at up to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit -- and thus unlivable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the milestone of an Earth-size planet had long been anticipated, astronomers on and off the Kepler team were jubilant. Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, another Kepler team member, called the new result ''a watershed moment in human history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Fischer, a planet hunter from Yale, who was not part of the team, said, ''This technological feat is incredibly important because it means that the detection of Earth-size planets at larger distances is technically possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 20e, the closer and hotter planet, is also the smaller -- about 6,900 miles across, or slightly smaller than Venus -- and it resides about 5 million miles from its star. The more distant planet, Kepler 20f, also broiling at around 800 degrees, is 10 million miles out from its star. It is 8,200 miles in diameter, about the size of Earth. The two planets are presumed to be rocky orbs that formed in the outskirts of their planetary system and then migrated inward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their star, which is slightly smaller and cooler than the Sun, is about 950 light years away from us. Kepler had previously found three larger Neptune-like planets around it, so the new observations bring the total to five so far. All the planets are well inside where Mercury would be in our own solar system, presenting a bounteous system of unlivable planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is Venus and Earth in a five-planet system,'' Dr. Fischer said in an e-mail. ''There's no place like home, and the Kepler data are starting to uncover some mighty familiar architectures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler detects planets by watching for blinks when they move in front of their stars. Since it was launched in 2009, it has found 2,326 potential planets, 207 that would be Earth-size, if confirmed as the two reported Tuesday have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmation of a planet, however, requires additional observations, usually of its star's wobbles as it gets tugged by the planet going around. The gravitational pull of planets as small as the Earth on their parent star is too small to measure with the current spectrographs. And so the astronomers resorted to a statistical method called Blender, developed by Dr. Fressin and Guillermo Torres of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, in which millions of computer simulations of background stars try to mimic the Kepler signal. They concluded that Kepler 20e was 3,400 times more likely to be a planet than background noise, while the odds in favor Kepler 20f being real were 1,370 to 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmed (or validated, as the Kepler team likes to say), they join the other planets already known to orbit the star. In a surprise for astronomers who thought they knew how planetary systems form, the orbits of the new planets are sandwiched between the orbits of the older, bigger, gassier ones, a configuration that does not occur in our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail, Dr. Charbonneau noted: ''In the solar system, rocky worlds and gas giants don't mingle. But in the Kepler 20 system they apparently do.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several days after newly discovered Comet Lovejoy streaked through the Sun's atmosphere (see video above), it provided a glorious pre-holiday display for astronauts aboard the International Space Station. NASA has posted an informative description of the comet's journey and its discovery earlier this month by Tom Lovejoy, an amateur astronomer in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I noticed the images thanks to a post from Jason Samenow at the Capital Weather Gang blog. After the comet uexpectedly survived its close solar encounter on Dec. 16, Samenow noted that the agency had prematurely predicted the comet's demise, even posting a video entitled, "The End of Comet Lovejoy."</p>

</div><div class="author">By EDWARD WONG and KENNETH CHANG; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Kenneth Chang from New York. </div><div>1302 words</div><div>30 December 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- Broadening its challenge to the United States, the Chinese government on Thursday announced an ambitious five-year plan for space exploration that would move China closer to becoming a major rival at a time when the American program is in retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with China's earlier vows to build a space station and put an astronaut on the moon, the plan conjured up memories of the cold-war-era space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States, which has de-emphasized manned spaceflight in recent years, is now dependent on Russia for transporting its astronauts to the International Space Station. Russia, for its part, has suffered an embarrassing string of failed satellite launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has been looking for ways to exert its growing economic strength and to demonstrate that its technological mastery and scientific achievements can approach those of any global power. The plan announced Thursday calls for launching a space lab and collecting samples from the moon, all by 2016, along with a more powerful manned spaceship and space freighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, China has also sought to build a military capacity in keeping with its economic might, expanding its submarine fleet and, this year, testing its first aircraft carrier, a refurbished Soviet model. Under the new space plan, it would vastly expand its version of a Global Positioning System, which would have military as well as civilian uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan shows how the government intends to draw on military and civilian resources to meet the goals, which the government is betting will also produce benefits for the Chinese economy. ''This approach offers lessons for other advanced space powers, including the U.S., which needs to make sure it sustains its high-level investment in various aspects of space development across the board,'' said Andrew S. Erickson, a professor at the United States Naval War College who has studied the Chinese space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a leader in the business of launching satellites, China is still years behind the United States in space. Its human spaceflight accomplishments to date put it roughly where the United States and the Soviet Union were in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But China has consistently stuck to a development timeline for its program and met the realistic goals set out in its five-year plans, which are mainstays of the Communist Party's authoritarian system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For human spaceflight, the plan lays out a continuation of China's steady but unrushed efforts to develop technologies and extend its capacities. It says that China will begin the work to land its astronauts on the moon, but it does not provide a target date for when they will go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is a comprehensive, moderately paced program,'' said John M. Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''It's not a crash program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, NASA's direction tends to shift with every change of presidency. President George W. Bush called on NASA to return to the moon by 2020. President Obama canceled that program and now wants the agency to send astronauts to an asteroid. NASA shut down its 30-year space shuttle program after a final flight in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The one thing that is admirable about their program is they don't have fits and starts,'' said Joseph R. Fragola, a space safety expert who has visited the space facilities in China. ''Their program is low budget but it is laid out, and they follow it in an orderly process, and we don't do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say Beijing is approaching its space program the way it did its military modernization. In addition to the aircraft carrier, which it bought from Ukraine, China has also made a progress on an anti-ship ballistic missile, which could be deployed to ward off foreign warships. Last January, the Chinese military tested a stealth fighter hours before Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary at the time, met in Beijing with President Hu Jintao.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in the United States, where there are separate military and civilian space programs, in China the People's Liberation Army is the driving force behind development of the Chinese space program. Civilian institutions, including various universities and laboratories, are part of the military-led efforts. In the white paper that laid out the plan, released by the State Council, China's cabinet, the authors took pains to say that Beijing was not seeking to challenge any nation militarily with its space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''China always adheres to the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes weaponization or any arms race in outer space,'' the paper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say one of the more notable goals of the five-year strategy is to further develop the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, which on Tuesday began providing navigation, positioning and timing data on China and surrounding areas. The white paper said China intended to have a global system by 2020, with 35 satellites in orbit. If it met that goal, China would join Russia in having a system that tries to rival America's. China has already launched 10 satellites for the Beidou system, and plans to launch six more next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beidou is not as advanced as its American counterpart, but it is expected to overshadow the Russian system and would provide the Chinese military with an alternative to relying on a civilian version of the American network. Beidou would also be used for civilian purposes, like providing drivers with a navigation tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has major commercial implications, it has major security implications,'' Mr. Erickson said. ''To be a great military and space power, it's important to have one's own satellite navigation system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The white paper, which follows similar reports released in 2000 and 2006, also said China would develop new Long March launch vehicles to deliver heavier payloads into orbit. It will also work on improving conditions for human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To lay that groundwork, the paper said, China ''will launch space laboratories, manned spaceship and space freighters; make breakthroughs in and master space station key technologies, including astronauts' medium-term stay, regenerative life support and propellant refueling; conduct space applications to a certain extent and make technological preparations for the construction of space stations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On deep-space exploration, the paper said China planned to launch orbiters that would make soft lunar landings and do roving and surveying. After that, the paper said, China will collect samples of the moon's surface and bring them back for analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper also said China planned to carry out a comprehensive plan for upgrading its satellite technology and widening the uses of its satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In aggregate, this is clearly going to propel China even further into space to a significant degree,'' Mr. Erickson said. ''There's relentless progress across the board.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, China became the third country to send a human into space, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, when it put Yang Liwei into orbit around the earth. It launched a lunar probe in 2007 that orbited the moon and took pictures, and the next year completed its first spacewalk when Zhai Zhigang remained for 13 minutes outside the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Long March 5 rocket, currently under development, would be able to lift about 25 tons to low-earth orbit, comparable to the United States' Delta IV Heavy rocket and much smaller than the Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo spacecraft to the moon four decades ago. But that would be enough for China to get to the moon by launching its lunar spacecraft in pieces and assembling it in the earth's orbit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To go to outer space, Catherine Culver went to a travel agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first flights of the new airlines that will take tourists past the threshold of space are poised to take off in 2012, and getting a seat on one is not all that different from booking a trip someplace on Earth. You can sign up on the Web site of, say, Virgin Galactic, the most prominent of the new space tourism companies, or go to a travel agent and put down a hefty deposit. Soon you will be able to buy travel insurance, just as you can for any other vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, space tourism has been limited to the ultrawealthy: just seven people have paid tens of millions of dollars each for a trip to the International Space Station aboard a Russian rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could change this year, when Virgin Galactic intends to start offering flights just beyond the space barrier on a rocket ship it has built, featuring five minutes of weightlessness during a two-and-a-half hour jaunt. At $200,000 a seat, this will open the final frontier to far more people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hopefully by next Christmas, myself, my daughter and my son will be the first people to go up into space'' on a commercial craft, Richard Branson, the owner of Virgin Galactic, said in a videotaped interview in November (with a touch of his signature grandiosity).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least two other specialty airlines have jumped in as well, taking reservations (and deposits) for future space flights. Allianz, the big insurer, will introduce an insurance product in 2012, lending space tourism the trappings of the regular travel industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just to be able to sell space travel as a regular part of your business, really, just how cool is that?'' said Lynda Turley Garrett, president of Alpine Travel of Saratoga, Calif., who is one of 58 accredited space agents for Virgin Galactic in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In five years, Ms. Garrett has sold three seats, including Ms. Culver's. But she expects that to change once passengers start going up and coming down to tell their friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2017, ''it'll be just like scheduling a flight to L.A.,'' Ms. Garrett predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Culver, who has worked as a mission controller at NASA and now gives motivational talks, has always wanted to go to space; she applied four times to become a NASA astronaut, with no luck. To book her spaceflight, she wanted a face-to-face conversation, so she looked through the list of Virgin's space agents and was pleased to find one near her home in San Jose, Calif. She and Ms. Garrett spent some time chatting, then went to lunch and chatted more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon afterward, Ms. Culver put down her $20,000 deposit, becoming one of 475 people who have reserved a place on a Virgin Galactic flight. Most of them have already paid the full ticket price to rise above the 62-mile mark, which is considered the entrance to outer space. (People who pay in full will get the first seats.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These flights will not orbit the Earth. Rather, they will be up-and-down ''suborbital'' jaunts more akin to a giant roller coaster ride, offering about five minutes of weightlessness at the acme of the flight. The trip is not for the faint of stomach: NASA used to train astronauts on a fast-diving airplane that offered intervals of weightlessness and was nicknamed the Vomit Comet -- apparently for good reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Virgin's customers, the ride to space will culminate a three-day trip to the newly built Spaceport America in Las Cruces, N.M. Part of the time will be spent on training and preparations. Part of it will be fun on the ground. ''Typical Virgin, there'll be parties going on,'' Ms. Garrett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the third day, a carrier airplane with the SpaceShipTwo rocket ship slung underneath will take off from the runway and fly to 50,000 feet, where the rocket ship will be launched. At that point, the force of acceleration will press passengers deep into their chairs -- someone who weighs 170 pounds will feel like half a ton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the roar of the engine will fade to silence, the blue sky will fade to black, and weight will turn to weightlessness. ''You'll be able to unbuckle, move about the cabin, do somersaults, get your picture taken with the Earth's curvature in the background,'' Ms. Garrett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, the passengers will strap back into their seats before SpaceShipTwo re-enters the atmosphere, exerting another few minutes of crushing force. Once it has slowed, it will glide back to the runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Culver, the Virgin flight will fulfill a dream, albeit an expensive one. ''In California, it would be similar to buying a house,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronaut dreams could reach the grasp of even more people if prices drop. In addition to Mr. Branson, the entrepreneurs who have introduced space ventures include Elon Musk of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and, more recently, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> founder, and Paul G. Allen, a <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder. The companies are primarily focused on carrying satellites to orbit and winning NASA contracts, but they have indicated that passenger trips may eventually be part of the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic is not the only one with paying customers. <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> of Mojave, Calif., has more than 100 reservations for a $95,000 seat on its small space plane, which will have just two seats -- one for the pilot and one for the passenger. XCOR could begin flying as soon as 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And <span class="companylink">Space Adventures Ltd</span>. of Vienna, Va., which has been taking reservations for a while at $110,000 a seat, has signed up more than 200 people. Its partner, Armadillo Aerospace of Heath, Tex., plans to build an automated spacecraft -- no pilot -- that can take up two people at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Space Adventures customer who paid his deposit more than a decade ago is Madsen Pirie, a British researcher who founded the Adam Smith Institute, which is dedicated to free-market policy. ''I was the first person in Britain to sign up,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is disappointed that the wait has stretched out -- Space Adventures has yet to set a target date for its suborbital flights -- but he has no regrets. ''It has been a story of postponed hopes,'' Mr. Pirie said. ''I shall be hugely delighted when my turn comes around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that things are speeding up, Allianz, which has a $1-billion-a-year travel insurance business, announced recently that it would offer insurance to Virgin Galactic customers to cover a range of possible problems, including last-minute cancellations and coverage for medical issues before or after the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the question of whether to offer space travel insurance first came up three or four years ago, ''we said it was a joke at that time,'' recalled Erick Morazin, global accounts director at <span class="companylink">Allianz Global Assistance</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Virgin Galactic, XCOR and Space Adventures refund almost all of the deposit if someone wants to cancel, but Mr. Morazin said he expected their policies to become less forgiving in the future. ''We will be prepared for this milestone,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] knows he is bound to come back to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an unusually productive first year in office that made him one of the nation’s most popular governors, his challenge in 2012 is maintaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Referring to his sky-high popularity — 68 percent of New York voters approved of his job performance[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/despite-misgivings-on-tax-overhaul-cuomo-wins-high-marks-in-poll-of-voters/] in a recent <span class="companylink">Quinnipiac University</span> poll — Mr. Cuomo said in an interview Wednesday, shortly after delivering his State of the State address, “Seventy percent I don’t believe is a sustainable level of popularity in this state.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the diversity of the state, the partisanship, the party enrollment, it’s just an absurdly high level,” he said. “That’s why I’ve always taken it with a grain of salt. Forget the number, I think people feel good that the government is working, and that’s what that number reflects basically, and I hope to keep them in a place where they’re feeling good.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mindful of the political risks if his momentum slows, Mr. Cuomo exhorted lawmakers in his nearly hourlong speech to ignore cynics who say “what happened last year was a fluke, you can’t do that again, that was for whatever reason, the stars, the planets, it was a one-time situation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year we learned how to walk,” he told lawmakers and the gathered audience, which included Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the governor’s girlfriend, the Food Network star Sandra Lee. This year, he said, “we’re going to run.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is already talked about as a possible presidential candidate in 2016, outlined a plan for 2012 that was more pragmatic than visionary, combining soaring rhetoric about New York’s greatness with plans for rebuilding bridges, creating commissions, opening casinos and restoring Buffalo. His top-line proposal would have made Robert Moses proud — Mr. Cuomo wants to build the nation’s largest convention center at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year, in many ways the high-profile accomplishments dealt with social justice issues and legislation addressing social justice issues,” he said. “This year, the relevant set of challenges are economic development and making the state function to generate jobs in partnership with the private sector. They are apples and oranges.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether one agrees with him or not, Mr. Cuomo accomplished a lot in his first year. He persuaded a Republican-led Senate to endorse same-sex marriage. He reached a deal with the Legislature to approve a property tax cap. He closed a $10 billion budget deficit in March without tax increases, and then last month appeared to bow to the Occupy movement by creating higher tax brackets for the rich while lowering tax rates for the middle class. He largely tamed the Legislature, which appeared ungovernable during the brief Spitzer and Paterson administrations, so quieting it that at times Albany’s rule by “three men in a room” — the governor and legislative leaders — seemed reduced to one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo also demonstrated some of the other characteristics that have surfaced over the course of his political career, including a penchant for operating in secret and an eagerness to stamp out even seemingly minor perceived threats. If a voter blinked last month, he or she would have missed the governor’s speedy revision of the state’s tax code, without public input or legislative debate. He resisted for seven months before releasing his daily schedules to The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> — a type of document his predecessors had agreed to release. And his administration went to some length to forestall Occupy Albany demonstrators from camping near the Capitol, creating a curfew to keep them from staying overnight at a state-owned park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, even if Mr. Cuomo faces the challenge of following up on his own first act, he also has the advantage of taking office after four chaotic years in Albany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If the government is functioning, if we’re not fighting, if it looks like a professional, competent operation, that’s what they are responding to,” he said of voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in his office during the interview, he brandished a copy of “The Happy Warrior,” a book Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote about Gov. Alfred E. Smith, and cited the description of Mr. Smith’s governing style to explain why he has assiduously courted a maligned Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He says in here, F.D.R. talking about Al Smith, that the test of an executive is the ability to get things done with a legislature,” he said, while thumbing through pages looking for an apt quote. “An executive, in part, rises or falls on his ability to get things done with the legislature. That’s my job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While still nosing through the book, Mr. Cuomo fielded one last question: Will he be in Iowa in four years, when the next presidential caucuses are held?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You think I’m going to move and become a farmer?” he replied, gamely. “Not only are my ratings going to plummet, they’re going to plummet to the point I have to flee the state. You would love that story, ‘Former governor flees the state!’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m focused on being the governor of the State of New York,” he said, smiling. “If you get past your cynicism for a second, you would understand that. I have been doing things and pursuing things that I would not if I were thinking about running for president.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Surveyor program indicated that a manned landing was possible -- and it proved the moon's surface to be solid enough for an astronaut to walk on without sinking. In July 1969, eighteen months after the final Surveyor probe, NASA put two men on the moon with the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 9, 1968, the Surveyor 7 space probe made a soft landing on the moon. It was the final mission of the Surveyor program, a series of unmanned explorations of the lunar surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times wrote that the 10-foot high, 638-pound probe had "had beaten unfavorable odds against landing undamaged on terrain of unknown ruggedness."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were seven Surveyor missions between 1966 and 1968, five of which landed safely on the moon. The primary purpose of the Surveyor program was to test the feasibility of soft, or controlled, landings on the moon and, in the words of The Times, provide "reconnaissance for a manned landing." The Surveyor probes conducted tests of properties of the moon's surface, and were equipped with cameras that provided tens of thousands of images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2011, more than 40 years after the Surveyor 7 lunar probe, NASA launched a one-ton rover named Curiosity toward Mars on a mission to search for organic compounds, which may determine "whether Mars might once have been hospitable for microbial life - or might even still be conducive to life." The rover is scheduled to land in August 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are your thoughts on the mission to Mars? In general, do you find the prospect of extraterrestrial life intriguing or disturbing? Why?</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>1123 words</div><div>10 January 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's catalog of historic artifacts includes two pairs of boots, an American flag, empty food bags, a pair of tongs and more than a hundred other items left behind at a place called Tranquillity Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history registry for New Mexico lists the same items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might be surprising, since Tranquillity Base is not in New Mexico or California but a quarter of a million miles away, in the spot where Neil A. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for archaeologists and historians worried that the next generation of people visiting the moon might carelessly obliterate the site of one of humanity's greatest accomplishments, these designations were important first steps toward raising awareness of the need to protect off-world artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's humanity's heritage,'' said Beth L. O'Leary, a professor of anthropology at New Mexico State University. ''It's just an incredible realm that archaeologists haven't begun to look at until now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. O'Leary herself had not given much thought to historic preservation on the Moon until a student asked her in 1999 whether federal preservation laws applied to the Apollo landing sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That started the ball rolling,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out to be a tricky question. Under international law, the United States government still owns everything it left on the moon: the bottom half of the first lunar lander, the scientific experiments, the urine bags. But 100 nations, including the United States, have signed the Outer Space Treaty, in which they agree not to claim sovereignty over any part of the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the last decade, the effort by Dr. O'Leary and her students to seek formal protection for the Apollo sites was a lonely pursuit. NASA, by its nature, looks more to its future than its past. ''There's a tendency of NASA, when their programs end, they tend to get rid of everything,'' said Milford Wayne Donaldson, the historic preservation officer for California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials were also wary that other countries would see granting historic protection to the Apollo sites as a ruse by the United States to put down territorial claims. And with no plans to go back to the moon, it all seemed like an academic exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But interest in the moon has perked up again. Russia and India plan to send robotic landers. NASA was going to send astronauts back there until the Obama administration changed course a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most crucially, the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, a competition among 26 teams to become the first private organization to put a spacecraft on the moon, offered a $1 million bonus for visiting a historic site there. At least one team announced it was heading for Tranquillity Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, the prospect of a new little rover's rolling over Neil Armstrong's footprints was not entirely farfetched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Dr. O'Leary started placing calls to historic preservation officials in states where the space industry looms large. Texas, she learned, couldn't help her, because to be listed as a historic resource there, an item must lie in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2009, she called Mr. Donaldson in Sacramento to recruit his help in protecting American relics on the moon, ''which I thought was an incredible, great idea right off the bat,'' he said. Dr. O'Leary and her students had already tried to get the National Park Service to list the base as a national historic landmark, but ''they had been turned down flatly,'' Mr. Donaldson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he checked California's laws, he found that artifacts just had to have an association with the state to be listed. The Apollo program qualified, and the Historical Resources Commission approved the listing in January 2010. New Mexico followed three months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA became interested, too. Robert Kelso, manager of lunar commercial services at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he had talked with top officials at the agency: ''We said if they're serious about going, we ought to get some of our best and brightest together and begin looking at this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA held a workshop a year ago about the preservation issue. Then Mr. Kelso led a team that cataloged what was left on the moon after the six Apollo landings, and it recommended how to balance historic preservation with the likely desire in the future to investigate how well the materials have lasted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recommendations, issued in the fall, place greater protections on items from the first moon mission, Apollo 11, and the last one, Apollo 17. For Apollo 11, the recommendations ask that any visitor, robotic or human, stay at least 75 meters from the lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In that case, it would protect every footprint from Neil and Buzz and all the flight hardware,'' Mr. Kelso said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Apollo 17, the protection bubble is even wider -- 225 meters -- because a lunar buggy let the last two men on the moon, Eugene A. Cernan and Harrison H. Schmitt, cover much more ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't protect every rover track and footprint,'' Mr. Kelso said, ''but we protected a lot of them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recommendation for the other landing sites is that visitors can get close but not touch anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelso's team also suggested guidelines for the paths of spacecraft overhead, to limit the chance that rocket exhaust will blow around lunar dust and damage the footprints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelso said NASA's recommendations, like the listings by California and New Mexico, have no legal force. ''We are hoping that whether it's an international team or a commercial team, they would honor and recognize the value of these sites and honor these recommendations,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a sea change for NASA to come out with recommendations,'' Dr. O'Leary said. ''I think that the guidance you provide certainly strengthens the moral sanctions against obliterating some part of the archaeological record.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lunar X Prize team that declared that it was going to Tranquillity Base, run by a company called Astrobotic Technology, now says it will stay away from the Apollo 11 and 17 sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donaldson would like to add Tranquillity Base to the United Nations' list of world heritage sites. But first he will have to get the rules changed. Currently, nations can nominate only sites that are ''on their territory.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A family drama usually isn't the first kind of movie to come to mind when one thinks about visual effects. But "The Tree of Life," Terrence Malick's film that incorporates the formation of the universe into the tale of one Texas family, has awards prognosticators taking notice of its nontraditional visual techniques. The film is on the Oscar shortlist for best visual effects and is likely the only film listed there to have used computer-generated imagery, space photography, drops of colored dyes and splashes of half-and-half in tanks of water to generate its effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malick wanted effects that would help convey the emotions of his ambitious story. He used as his visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, whose resume includes "Speed Racer," "Batman Begins" and the "Matrix" sequels. And Mr. Malick brought in Douglas Trumbull, a filmmaker in his own right whose effects experience includes groundbreaking work on "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," as a consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Mr. Glass and Mr. Trumbull discuss how they helped Mr. Malick achieve his vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One scene that comes about 30 minutes into the movie flashes back to the prehistoric era. By a river, a predator shows mercy to a young parasaur. The scene reflects a moment in the evolutionary process when consciousness and awareness of others are evident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Terry was always trying to find the Tao, the beauty and natural aspects to the things he photographs," Mr. Glass said of Mr. Malick's approach. "We tried to play things down a lot of the time. You come across the dinosaurs and they're offset or they're very strongly backlit, so they're really just a silhouette. It's trying to find a way to show them that isn't about showing off the work that's been done, but finding restraint."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scene above looks at the universe coming into formation. "We wanted to find ways to replicate what nature does normally, which has to do with gravity, atmosphere, forces and heat that form stars, planets and galaxies," Mr. Trumbull said. "We tried to do it in a way that was in keeping with what you see in real space photographs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the many ways these natural acts were simulated was through the use of a water tank, similar to one that Mr. Trumbull used on "Close Encounters." He first thought of the idea while working on "2001: A Space Odyssey," when pouring cream in to his coffee and seeing the patterns it made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For "The Tree of Life," they introduced fluorescent dyes into a tank of water and used different lighting techniques for effects. "We found when we lit them from the side, we could get something that looked exactly like it came out of the Hubble space telescope," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects team experimented in labs on weekends and developed a technique where the dyes were filmed from different distances and lit with a high-wattage xenon lamp. It created an interstellar quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the most interesting things about it was Terry's willingness to go into the unexplored," Mr. Trumbull said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the dyes, some actual Cassini spacecraft photography was used for scenes and enhanced with effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are images of Saturn where, when you work with the pristine, beautiful, original material, it actually looks so clean, you couldn't put it on the screen without people thinking it's just CG," Mr. Glass said. "And so we had to add in tiny subtle textual details." They separated out the moons around Saturn and added texture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scenes have a crispness to their imagery that a viewer could get lost inside. The filmmakers produced the work at an IMAX level of detail, using 5.5K screen resolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was a part of Terry's passion," Mr. Glass said. "He wanted to feel that you could zoom into an image and sense the detail that kept going. Like life itself, you don't run out of pixel detail."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian scientific spacecraft whizzing out of control around the Earth, and expected to re-enter the atmosphere on Saturday, may have failed because it was struck by some type of antisatellite weapon, the director of Russia's space agency said in an interview published Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did not say who would want to interfere with the spacecraft, which was intended to explore a moon of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian craft, named Phobos-Grunt for the moon and the Russian word for ground, ran into trouble soon after it was launched in November, when its rockets failed to lift it out of low Earth orbit. What was to have been a two-and-a-half-year interplanetary journey to retrieve a soil sample from Phobos will instead end over the weekend, according to Russian engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the 13-ton Phobos-Grunt breaks up in the atmosphere, debris could potentially fall anywhere along a vast stretch of the Earth's surface that includes the cities of New York, London and Tokyo. Though the odds are heavily against the debris causing any harm, the spectacle of people around the world anticipating the crash is another embarrassment for Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, which has presided over a series of rocket and satellite failures this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement from the United States Strategic Command acknowledged that it was tracking the space probe and that it is likely to fall in the next week. ''Predictions of re-entry date, time and location can change significantly due to many changing factors, such as solar weather and orientation of the spacecraft,'' the statement said. ''These predictions become more accurate as the event approaches.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Phobos-Grunt first went awry, the director of the Russian space agency, Vladimir Popovkin, said that a flawed navigational computer might be to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said that they helped Roscosmos, using NASA's antennas known as the Deep Space Network, to try to re-establish contact with Phobos-Grunt, and that NASA had continued these efforts until the antennas were needed for the launch of its Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft on Nov. 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin's remarks to the newspaper Izvestia were the first high-level suggestion of nefarious interference. A retired commander of Russia's missile warning system had speculated in November that strong radar signals from installations in Alaska might have damaged the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want to accuse anybody, but there are very powerful devices that can influence spacecraft now,'' Mr. Popovkin said in the interview. ''The possibility they were used cannot be ruled out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin also suggested that equipment on the spacecraft may have broken down while the vehicle was stored on the ground, waiting for the time when Earth and Mars would be in the right places in their orbits for the mission to proceed, something that happens only every two years. ''If we had not sent it to Mars in 2011, we would have had to throw it away,'' he said of the craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interview came at a time of rising anti-Americanism in Russian politics, and may have been intended mostly for a domestic audience. Russian officials often drop hints of foreign meddling, for example in stirring the recent street protests in Moscow; such comments are usually taken to mean the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin's remarks stood out in stark contrast to the cooperative spirit of recent Russian civilian space endeavors carried out in partnership with NASA, the European Space Agency and other foreign partners. Though Russia maintains a military wing of its space program, confrontation and even competition with the United States in space largely vanished with the end of the cold war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two powers called the space race a tie and agreed to build the International Space Station together; now that the American space shuttles are retired, NASA astronauts fly to the station aboard Russian rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin did not directly implicate the United States in the interview. But he said ''the frequent failure of our space launches, which occur at a time when they are flying over the part of Earth not visible from Russia, where we do not see the spacecraft and do not receive telemetric information, are not clear to us,'' an apparent reference to the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has not succeeded in sending a spacecraft to Mars since the 1980s. An attempt in 1996 to launch a Mars lander that could burrow below the planet's surface failed because of a flaw in the rocket that carried it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phobos-Grunt, which took about five years to build and cost $160 million at current exchange rates, was launched from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan on Nov. 9; it also carried a small Chinese Mars orbiter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Russian scientific probe that was meant to visit a Martian moon but never made it out of Earth orbit crashed into the Pacific Ocean about 700 miles west of Chile on Sunday, a Russian military spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phobos-Grunt spacecraft had been circling Earth since shortly after its launching on Nov. 9, losing a few miles of altitude each day until it fell into the atmosphere. The 13-ton ship was one of the heaviest manmade objects yet to make an uncontrolled plunge back to Earth, though most of its weight was fuel and probably burned up during re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vehicle could have crashed almost anywhere, but as with other falling space junk, the odds were that it would hit an ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Aleksei Zolotukhin, a spokesman for Russia's Aerospace Defense Troops, told the Interfax news agency that the spacecraft, which broke up in the atmosphere, hit the water in fragments around 12:45 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash cut short what was to have been an ambitious two-and-a-half-year voyage to Phobos, one of Mars's two small moons, and back again. The mission to retrieve the first soil sample from a Martian moon would have been a milestone for Russia. The Phobos-Grunt's lander was equipped with a small shovel to put about eight ounces of dirt into a tiny capsule to return to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission started with a successful launching to Earth orbit, but the engine that was meant to boost the spacecraft out of orbit and on its way to Mars failed to fire, and scientists on the ground were unable to correct the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars exploration has been a consistent goal of the Soviet and then Russian space program despite a history of setbacks. The $170 million Phobos-Grunt craft was the first attempt since 1996, when an earlier Mars probe also failed soon after launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculating last week about possible causes of the latest failure, the director of the Russian space agency said that Phobos-Grunt might have been hit by an antisatellite weapon from an unspecified source while over the Western Hemisphere and out of direct observation from Russia. He also mentioned possible technical flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western scientists have dismissed as improbable the speculation by a retired Russian general that a powerful radar antenna in Alaska, intended to study the ionosphere, had zapped the Mars probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Phobos-Grunt broke up and burned on re-entry, the Russian space agency said, as many as about two dozen pieces might have reached the surface, weighing a total of about 400 pounds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ''Star Wars'' movies, Luke Skywalker's home planet, Tatooine, orbits two suns, giving it two sunsets and two sunrises every day. In September, scientists discovered the first planet in our galaxy that orbits two stars; now they have discovered two more and suggest that there are probably millions of these so-called circumbinary planets in the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found two more, and that immediately tells us, wow, this wasn't a fluke,'' said William Welsh, an astronomer at San Diego State University who was involved in the research. ''Now that we have three, we can compare the differences and start to learn more about these as a class of planetary systems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Welsh and his colleagues report their discovery of the planets in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper describes Kepler 34b and Kepler 35b, both gaseous planets about the size of Saturn; they are 4,900 and 5,400 light-years from Earth, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planets were identified by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, whose mission is to find other potentially habitable planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life could exist on a circumbinary planet, Dr. Welsh said. The first to be discovered, Kepler 16b, was just outside what is known as the habitable zone, where liquid water, and therefore life, can exist. It is just a little too far from its suns, and too cold for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 34b, described in the current study, is also just outside the habitable zone, in this case a bit too hot for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That, to me, is interesting,'' Dr. Welsh said. ''It may be that we search a bit more and find that Goldilocks.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- Russian officials said on Tuesday that they were investigating whether powerful American radar systems might have caused the failure of a $170 million scientific probe headed for a moon of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri O. Rogozin said that Russian investigators would run tests on a model satellite to determine whether the type and strength of radiation produced by the radar system could have interfered with the Phobos-Grunt probe as it orbited overhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope it's not so, but if it is, we will accordingly draw the necessary conclusions,'' Mr. Rogozin said. ''It's still too early to tell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several American radar installations have been mentioned for study. One is in Alaska; another, in the Marshall Islands, was studying the trajectory of an asteroid at the time of Phobos-Grunt's failure in November, a Russian space industry official told Kommersant, a daily newspaper. Russian officials have also suggested that the 13-ton probe, which fell out of orbit and burned up in the atmosphere on Sunday, scattering some debris over the Pacific Ocean, might have been struck by an anti-satellite weapon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Alexander Zakharov, science secretary at the Institute of Space Research, said it was unlikely that the probe's failure could have been caused by American radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can come up with lots of exotic reasons, but first you need to look at the device and see if there's a problem there,'' he said, according to RIA Novosti news agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogozin said the failures of the Russian space industry in the 1990s may have played a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main thing now is to rid us of the consequences of the unpleasant 1990s, when production fell sharply and the potential of the rocket and space industry was depressed,'' he told another news agency, Interfax. ''We now see that the failures in space are connected to defects in the equipment that was produced some 12 to 13 years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phobos-Grunt, which was meant to spend 2 1/2 years traveling to Phobos, a moon of Mars, and returning a soil sample to Earth, was launched Nov. 9 from the Russian spaceport in Kazakhstan, but an engine that was supposed to boost it out of Earth orbit failed to ignite, and scientists on the ground were unable to correct the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE United States has been out of the space shuttle business for a few months now, but the country is still seriously considering spending billions of dollars to send astronauts back to the moon, to Mars or to a nearby asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's heartening that the pioneering spirit behind crewed missions into outer space has not been dampened by the nation's tide of red ink. But with price tags like $50 billion to return astronauts to the moon in the next decade, there's a strong bang-for-the-buck argument to be made for far less expensive missions headed in the other direction: down into the ocean depths, which remain largely unexplored and unseen by human eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's limited experience with undersea missions has nonetheless shown the great potential for scientific and technological advances and valuable spinoffs that come when public investments are made in bold exploratory ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, an accidental death helped sink the United States Navy's Sealab program. A diver's breathing gear apparently malfunctioned in the dark cold just outside the lab, an astounding 610 feet below the surface. It was a sobering reminder of the inherent risks of making prolonged deep dives. The risks include not only the bends -- the painful and potentially lethal consequence of surfacing too rapidly -- but also breathing exotic gas mixtures (ordinary air becomes toxic beyond certain depths and pressures) and exposure to the frigid temperatures of the deep sea. Conditions underwater can be every bit as hostile as in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sealab had been showing the way toward establishing outposts on the ocean floor, albeit in the shadow of NASA's space program. The Navy program achieved major breakthroughs that made it possible, for the first time, to house free-swimming divers on the seabed, and at far greater depths than ever thought possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike conventional divers, who are limited to brief forays from the surface, these aquanauts -- as sea-dwelling divers have been called -- could not only reach greater depths, but they could also stay down for an indefinite period, spending hours at a time in the water instead of minutes, provided they had a pressurized, climate-controlled shelter nearby. The advent of the aquanaut meant that a vast and varied submerged frontier was open to human exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Navy had an interest in science and exploration, it was mainly concerned with what aquanauts could do for the military, like recovering sunken aircraft, ships or downed submarines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the beneficiaries of the Sealab program was the offshore oil industry. The revolutionary diving methods devised for Sealab emerged just as the industry was moving into deeper waters and needed an expanded underwater work force that could handle both increased depths and longer durations. The industry customized and streamlined its approach so that commercial divers could put in full-day shifts on the seabed without actually having to live down there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Navy ultimately gave up on Sealab and sea bases, largely because they didn't suit its military priorities. The program was shelved after the accident in February 1969, a few months shy of the first moon landing. But the Navy continued to use its newfangled diving methods in other operations -- like top-secret missions to spy on the former Soviet Union. This involved housing deep-diving aquanauts on submarines rather than in a stationary base like Sealab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several dozen science-oriented underwater shelters came and went around the globe, including a few made in the United States. Most were productive but relatively low-budget affairs, as is the United States' only remaining sea base, which is also the world's only such base. It's an otherworldly looking structure called Aquarius, about the size of a city bus, which is owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and run by the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. It gets by on less than $3 million a year, compared to, say, the cost of a single shuttle mission, which NASA has estimated to be $450 million (other estimates have been considerably higher). The entire Sealab program cost taxpayers about $20 million; close to $20 billion was spent during the same period to reach the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE the early 1990s, Aquarius has been stationed on a coral reef a few miles south of Key Largo, Fla., in water about 60 feet deep. There, it has carried on the legacy of Sealab by serving as a valuable undersea vantage point for scientists. Dozens of scientist-aquanauts have published 300 research papers over the course of about 120 missions, ranging in duration from a few days to a couple of weeks. Examples of the work made possible by these underwater stays include ocean acidification studies and examinations of how herbivore diversity may be manipulated to conserve and restore degrading reefs -- knowledge critical to life on earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archaeologists would benefit greatly by having an underwater base of operations. So might commercial interests in search of mineral deposits. And as in space, one line of inquiry may open the door to another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remotely operated probes, robots, sensors and vehicles, known as R.O.V.'s, also have their place in ocean research, much as they do in space. Such machines can be more cost effective, reach greater depths and keep human beings out of harm's way. The government's own Okeanos Explorer, a converted naval surveillance ship, is making impressive use of R.O.V.'s and other devices to churn up reams of data about the seafloor while engaging many scientists in its process of discovery. But sometimes there's just no substitute for the presence of a sentient human, perhaps no more so than in the dynamic, living realm of ''the silent world,'' as Jacques Cousteau famously called the sea. Marine scientists who have experienced the aquatic life will tell you: there's nothing like living in the sea to gain a better understanding of it, for much the same reason that Jane Goodall lived in the jungle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides accomplishing their intended goals, scientists are able to see and experience the unexpected, at any time of day or night, and new revelations await -- like the discovery of a marine plant or animal that could produce the next wonder drug. In the meantime, getting better acquainted with our home planet, at prices we can afford, is reason enough to continue paying for Aquarius, expand its capability and replicate it elsewhere in the silent world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON -- West Virginia lost one, until it turned up one June day on a bookshelf in the basement of a retired dentist. New York has one in a vault at a museum in Albany, but another one given to the state for safekeeping was not kept very safe, because it appears to be missing, though the attorney general's office has started looking into the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long-lost one in Colorado resurfaced at the home of a former governor, and another one in Arkansas was found among former President Bill Clinton's memorabilia. Somebody swiped one from a museum in the island country of Malta, and somebody else who got his hands on one in Honduras tried to sell it in Miami to an undercover federal agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rare art? Priceless jewels? Nothing so terrestrial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these items were literally out of this world: moon rocks, meteorite samples and other so-called astromaterials that were lent to researchers by NASA or were offered as gifts to American and foreign leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of moon rocks and other space objects have been lost, destroyed, stolen or remain unaccounted for, some of which American astronauts and presidents presented to dignitaries around the country and the world decades ago and others that NASA officials lent for education, research and public display. The objects survived in outer space for ages and include some of the first samples ever returned from another planetary body, but after just a few short years on Earth they met the same fate as a set of car keys or a 29-cent postcard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six meteorite samples lost in the mail in 2004 were headed to a lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington and have never been seen since. In 1978, NASA lent a lunar sample disk to the Mount Cuba Astronomical Observatory in Greenville, Del. By the time NASA inquired about the disk more than 30 years later, the manager responsible for it had died and the disk -- a six-inch diameter disk with soil and rock materials from the moon -- was gone. NASA says the observatory could not locate it, but a member of the observatory's board of trustees maintains that the manager sent it back to NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A piece of the moon weighing 1.1 grams -- among lunar samples collected by Apollo 17 astronauts in December 1972 -- was given to the governor of West Virginia more than one year later. Its whereabouts were unknown in recent years, until the fragment resurfaced in June 2010, in a box in the basement game room of Robert T. Conner, a retired dentist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only connection between him and the governor who was presented the lunar fragment, Arch A. Moore Jr., was Mr. Conner's brother, who died in 2002. Mr. Moore had been a lawyer in the Washington law firm that the brother owned, and the box containing the fragment included items from the man's office. The fragment was about the size of a dime, encased in a Lucite ball and mounted on a wooden plaque, and Mr. Conner had never given it much thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was not eye-catching at all, that's for sure,'' said Mr. Conner, 76. ''I've seen better-looking bowling trophies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA's inspector general, Paul K. Martin, determined that 517 moon rocks and other astromaterial samples that were lent between 1970 and 2010 had been lost or stolen. A report issued by Mr. Martin's office found that 11 of the 59 researchers in the Houston and Washington areas who were audited could not account for all of the samples NASA had lent them, or the agency found other discrepancies, including researchers who had items that according to agency records either did not exist or had been lent to others. The space agency had also failed to update its records for 12 researchers who had died, retired or relocated, in some instances without returning the samples. One researcher, the report noted, still had lunar samples he had borrowed 35 years earlier though he never conducted research on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that Johnson Space Center's Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office in Houston, which maintains NASA's collection of 163,000 astromaterial samples, lacked sufficient control over its loans of moon rocks and other items for research, education and public display. The samples that American and foreign dignitaries received as gifts were not included in the report, because the space agency does not track them. Moon-rock experts say NASA should keep an inventory of those as well, and they estimate that of nearly 400 moon rocks given to state and world leaders after the Apollo 11 and 17 missions, almost 200 have been lost, destroyed or stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spokesmen for NASA in Washington and Houston said the losses reported by the inspector general represented only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of astromaterial samples the space agency had lent to scientists around the world for more than 40 years. In particular, the lost samples from the moon amounted to less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of the samples that were safely returned in the past four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although such losses at any time are regrettable, and NASA agrees with the I.G. report that continuing to improve certain procedures could reduce the rate at which they occur, the benefits to science of making these samples available for study have vastly outweighed the tiny risk of loss,'' a NASA spokesman in Houston, William P. Jeffs, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they were implementing the recommendations in the report, which called for the space agency to require loan agreements for all types of materials and strengthen the inventory verification process, among other steps. Mr. Jeffs said that although several researchers involved in losing samples were reprimanded in letters from NASA, their research privileges were not revoked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few Americans have been as focused on moon rocks as Joseph R. Gutheinz Jr., a Texas lawyer who keeps a spinning globe on his desk reading, ''Moon Rock Hunter.'' The title is not official (the globe was a gift from one of his sons), but it might as well be: Mr. Gutheinz and his criminal justice students at the University of Phoenix and Alvin Community College in Alvin, Tex., have helped track down 77 moon rocks that were missing, including those presented to governors in Colorado, Missouri and West Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If someone hands a governor a moon rock, and he keeps it or loses it, if you can't protect something like that, maybe they're not that vigilant,'' said Mr. Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent in NASA's inspector general office. ''And if they're not that careful, and they bring it home with them, what else have they brought home with them?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gutheinz was the undercover agent who led a Miami sting operation to recover a moon rock stolen in Honduras in 1998. It was called Operation Lunar Eclipse. Mr. Gutheinz ran an advertisement in USA Today reading, ''Moon Rocks Wanted,'' and a man called offering to sell him a real moon rock. The asking price was $5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to United Press International, "Officials said an electrical spark must have ignited the pure oxygen inside the cabin." The spark, which likely occurred in front of Mr. Grissom's seat, created a huge fire because of the pure oxygen atmosphere and flammable materials in the cockpit. Just 17 seconds after the astronauts began screaming that there was a fire, all communication to the cockpit was lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 27, 1967, the astronauts Virgil (Gus) Grissom, Edward H. White and Roger B. Chaffee died in a flash fire during a test aboard their Apollo I spacecraft at Cape Kennedy, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times reported: "The astronauts were the first American spacemen to be killed on the job and ironically, died while on the ground. The bodies were removed hours later and a space agency spokesman said death was 'instantaneous.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts had almost no hope of escaping because of the numerous latches on the spacecraft's hatch, which opened inward to the pressurized cabin. It typically took about 90 seconds to open. Emergency workers on the ground lacked the equipment needed to handle such a fire and had difficulty reaching the spacecraft because of the intense heat and smoke emanating from it. It took approximately five minutes for workers to finally open the hatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's investigations into the accident revealed several significant flaws in the design of the spacecraft and in the program's emergency readiness. Consequently, NASA made changes to its Apollo spacecraft, like reducing the levels of oxygen in the cockpit, removing flammable materials from the cockpit and redesigning the hatch to open outward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lessons NASA learned from the Apollo 1 fire are often credited with making the subsequent Apollo 1 missions safer. In a 2007 article for MSNBC, James Oberg, however, argued that a continued emphasis on learning from tragedies like Apollo 1 or the 1986 Challenger and 2003 Columbia space shuttle disasters acts as a way of "ducking a fearsome responsibility" for the mistakes that caused the tragedies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In your opinion, does focusing on the "lessons" of a disaster detract from accountability? From what other tragedies in modern history have we learned "lessons"? Do you think tragedies are inevitable in the quest for innovation and progress? Why or why not?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the United States establish a moon colony and develop a new propulsion system for going to Mars? All within eight years of a Newt Gingrich presidency, as Mr. Gingrich promised this week?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answers seem to be technologically yes, economically iffy and politically very difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In proposing an ambitious vision for space, Mr. Gingrich stepped into the eternal debate over where the nation's and NASA's priorities should lie. Mr. Gingrich spoke little about NASA's unmanned missions, which many think produce better science with less money. Inspiration and economic frontiers, not science, drive his long-standing enthusiasm for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I come at space from a standpoint of a romantic belief that it really is part of our destiny,'' Mr. Gingrich said in his speech on Wednesday. He joked about a legislative proposal, early in his Congressional career, that a moon colony could apply for statehood once its population reached 13,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, at a debate on Thursday, Mr. Gingrich's Republican opponents lambasted a moon colony as a loony, budget-busting idea in a time of fiscal austerity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney said he thought a moon base would cost hundred of billions of dollars or more. ''I'd rather be rebuilding housing here in the U.S.,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Paul quipped, ''I think we maybe should send some politicians up there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smallest hurdle is technology. After all, sending astronauts back to the moon by 2020 and setting up a permanent home there was the goal of the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and NASA had embarked on developing new rockets and spacecraft to accomplish that. Few doubted that, given enough money and time, NASA would be able to duplicate its success of more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A permanent moon base could adapt technologies used in building the International Space Station. NASA was also developing an R.V.-like lunar vehicle where astronauts could drive around the surface of the Moon for weeks at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But money was the problem. When the program, known as Constellation, did not receive as much financing as originally promised, development fell behind, pushing up the price tag. A review of experts concluded that it would cost $150 billion for Constellation to reach its destination close to the original schedule. The Obama administration instead canceled it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new NASA program similar to Constellation with brand new rockets would be similarly expensive. But a recent NASA study concluded that the space agency could use smaller existing rockets, coupled with fueling stations in orbit, to reach the Moon within a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new propulsion system for going to Mars would likely call for reviving old technology -- nuclear-powered rocket engines that were originally developed in the 1950s. NASA has already begun work on nuclear propulsion -- nuclear reactors that provide continuous thrust -- but lacks the money to finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gingrich talked of overturning the status quo at NASA, pushing to work faster, to accept greater risks and let private companies take the lead role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not something that should be mocked or should be seen as a remote possibility,'' said Michael Gold, director of the Washington office of <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, a private space company. ''The reason this is both possible and economically viable is that many of the systems and technology, if not all, already exist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigelow, using technology licensed from NASA, has plans to launch two inflatable space stations, capable of housing 36 people, and the same technology could be scaled up to provide living quarters on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich proposed setting aside about 10 percent of NASA's budget for prizes, similar to the $25,000 that Charles Lindbergh won for being the first to fly across the Atlantic, or, more recently, the $10 million X Prize for commercial spacecraft to rise above the 62-mile-high edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over eight years, this would create a prize pot of more than $14 billion. Mr. Gingrich suggested offering a $10 billion prize for the first venture to make a trip to Mars. If no one succeeds, taxpayers pay nothing. If someone does, $10 billion would be cheaper, by a factor of 10 or 100, than any government-run program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large aerospace companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> would likely pass on the prizes -- it would be a tough sell to investors when the payoff could be nothing at all -- but Mr. Gingrich's allies, including Bob Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, believe that technology billionaires like Jeffrey Bezos, founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, would willingly invest their own money in hopes of fame, if not fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether any of these ideas could win enough political support is another question. When Mr. Obama called for the cancellation of Constellation, he proposed that NASA rely much more on commercial companies in the future, echoing many of the same themes that Mr. Gingrich is advocating. Mr. Gingrich even wrote an opinion piece lauding Mr. Obama's proposed plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Gingrich, a longtime space enthusiast, seems more likely to spend the political capital to push his proposals. Charles Miller, formerly a senior adviser at NASA for commercial space, said all of the pieces of Mr. Gingrich's space plans were plausible if not fleshed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The improbable thing at this point is if Newt will become president,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a Moon Colony Would Require</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Rockets capable of carrying astronauts and cargo to the moon. NASA is developing a new heavy-lift rocket. Newt Gingrich suggests smaller existing rockets could suffice. But smaller rockets would make the mission more complicated because moon-lander pieces would have to be assembled in orbit, as was the Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* A spacecraft that can land on the moon. Such a craft does not exist, but no big technology leaps are needed since NASA did this more than 40 years ago when astronauts landed on the moon. For a permanent base, a larger craft would be needed to ferry the pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Habitats where the astronauts would live. Years ago, NASA began preliminary designs but did not progress far before the program was canceled. A commercial company, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, believes its technology of inflatable modules can be adapted for lunar habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anything built on the moon would have to withstand the sharp-edged lunar dust and large temperature swings, which go from -200 to +200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question of Space: This is the third in a series of articles about the intersection of politics and science. Earlier articles examined an anti-abortion initiative to declare fertilized eggs to be ''persons'' and the impact of Michelle Bachman's views on a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAT CREEK, Calif. -- E.T. might be phoning, but do we care enough to take the call?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating on money and equipment scrounged from the public and from Silicon Valley millionaires, and on the stubborn strength of their own dreams, a band of astronomers recently restarted one of the iconic quests of modern science, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence -- SETI, for short -- which had been interrupted last year by a lack of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, a brace of 42 radio telescopes, known as the Allen Telescope Array, nestled here in the shadow of Lassen Peak, came to life and resumed hopping from star to star in the constellation Cygnus, listening for radio broadcasts from alien civilizations. The lines are now open, but with lingering financial problems, how long they will remain that way is anybody's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These should be boom times for those seeking out aliens, or at least their radio proxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers now know that the galaxy is teeming with at least as many planets -- the presumed sites of life -- as stars. Advanced life and technology might be rare in the cosmos, said Geoffrey W. Marcy, the Watson and Marilyn Alberts in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence professor at the University of California, Berkeley, ''but surely they are out there, because the number of Earthlike planets in the Milky Way galaxy is simply too great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple ''howdy,'' a squeal or squawk, or an incomprehensible stream of numbers captured by one of the antennas here at the University of California's Hat Creek Radio Observatory would be enough to end our cosmic loneliness and change history, not to mention science. It would answer one of the most profound questions humans ask: Are we alone in the universe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite decades of space probes and billions of NASA dollars looking for life out there, there is still only one example of life in the universe: the DNA-based web of biology on Earth. ''In this field,'' said Jill Tarter, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., the ''number two is the all-important number. We count one, two, infinity. We're all looking for number two.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story of SETI is the story of a dream deferred by politics, a lack of money and the technological challenges of searching what astronomers call ''the cosmic haystack'': 100 billion stars in the galaxy and 9 billion narrow-band radio channels on which aliens, if they exist, might be trying to hail us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politics and the recession have crimped astronomers' budgets and left the institute's scientists with a kind of siege mentality. Last spring, the University of California ran out of money to run the Hat Creek observatory, forcing the Allen telescopes into hibernation. In order to continue the search, astronomers are negotiating a deal to share the telescopes with the Air Force, which wants to use them to track satellites and space junk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No federal funds have been spent searching for radio signals from extraterrestrials since 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent visit to the SETI Institute's Mountain View offices found many of the cubicles empty and the corridors eerily quiet. Last summer, as the Allen telescopes slumbered, weeds grew around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">998,000 Stars to Go</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story begins with a young radio astronomer named Frank Drake, who pointed an antenna from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., at a pair of stars in 1960, wondering if he could make contact with anything or anyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All he got was static, but the hook was set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1971, NASA held a workshop led by Barney Oliver, the research chief of <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, that concluded the best way to find extraterrestrials was with a $10 billion array of giant radio telescopes called Cyclops. The price tag -- as well as the subject -- set off alarm bells that still reverberate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1978, Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, an outspoken critic of what he considered wasteful government spending, awarded one of his infamous ''Golden Fleece'' awards to the hunt for aliens, and in 1993, a NASA-sponsored survey for signals from 1,000 nearby stars was canceled by Congress. With the help of friends like Dr. Oliver in the Silicon Valley, Dr. Tarter and her colleagues took the search private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the director of SETI research at the institute, Dr. Tarter, 67, has become the public face of the cause, and she was consulted by the actress Jodie Foster about her portrayal of Ellie Arroway, a radio astronomer who finds a signal, in the movie ''Contact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter was recruited in 1976, when, as a postdoctorate student at Berkeley, she read the Cyclops report, a rite of passage for most alien-oriented astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You didn't have to ask a priest or philosopher about life in the universe,'' Dr. Tarter said. But she realized she was in the first generation who could conduct experiments about it. A half-century and roughly 2,000 stars later, humanity is still officially alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Drake is undaunted, noting that there are 100 billion suitable stars in the galaxy. His personal estimate, based on an equation he invented in 1961, is that there are 10,000 technological civilizations in the galaxy, one per million stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've known all along we have to look at a million stars,'' he said. Now a cherubic 81, Dr. Drake is a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a former chairman of the SETI Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Allen Array, which was designed to find Dr. Drake his million stars, is named after Paul G. Allen, the <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder and philanthropist, who put up $25 million to get the project going. Jointly owned and operated by the University of California, Berkeley, and the SETI Institute, it was to consist of 350 antennas, 20 feet in diameter, that were to be mass-produced like satellite dishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full array would be able to map a swath of sky several full moons in diameter in only 10 minutes, or the whole sky in a night -- of great interest to astronomers and, as it turned out, to the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Allen's contribution was only enough to build 42 antennas, which started operating in 2007. The astronomers say that another $55 million would complete the array, but there have been no volunteers yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project got a lift in 2009 when Dr. Tarter won a $100,000 prize and ''One Wish to Change the World'' at the TED conference -- short for Technology, Entertainment and Design -- in Long Beach, Calif. Her talk there began, ''The story of humans is the story of ideas.'' It elicited a donation of valuable equipment from Dell and Intel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project got another lift -- mainly psychological -- last year when NASA, whose Kepler spacecraft is beaming back news about the patch of Cygnus that it surveys, published its first list of 1,235 exoplanet candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Tarter told a conference of exoplanet hunters recently: ''We're not just pointing at stars. We're pointing where you have shown us there are planets, and perhaps technologists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recession and the cutbacks that followed wiped out the university's funds to run the Hat Creek observatory just as it was getting started on a survey of Kepler's planets. The Allen telescopes went quiet, and the astronomical staff left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appeal for financing went out on the institute's Web site, which eventually brought in about $220,000 -- roughly two months' worth of operating expenses. Meanwhile, the Air Force was interested in using the radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array, Dr. Tarter explained, turns out to be adept at tracking satellites and space junk, a possibility first identified as early as 2004 in a memo by her husband, William Welch, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is known as Jack. ''There's a long tradition of radio astronomy and the military scratching each other's backs,'' Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under terms of an agreement still being negotiated, the Air Force will pay for a share of the operations at Hat Creek, which costs about $1.5 million (plus another $1 million a year to pay the astronomers). The money raised so far will buy a few months at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome All Species</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers started bringing their equipment back to Hat Creek in September. The place looked neglected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody had cut the weeds,'' Dr. Tarter said. ''It looked so sad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, when Dr. Tarter and Dr. Welch returned to Hat Creek in Dr. Welch's Cessna with a reporter in tow, the weeds had been cut and the antennas were majestically turning to a music only they could hear. Scattered across a meadow, they resembled the forest of satellite dishes you see outside events like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby in an unassuming ranch house, racks of electronics and computers hummed with life. The doormat read, ''Welcome All Species.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, Dr. Tarter plopped down in front of a computer and watched with a suspicious eye as the display popped with a row of numbers indicating that a narrow-band signal -- the signature of an artificial source -- had been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She takes great pride in the fact that she and her colleagues have never published a false alarm, and she nodded approvingly as the telescope and computers went through the process of eliminating the new signal from consideration. The Earth's motion will cause the frequency of a signal from the sky to drift in frequency, for example. The checklist has grown over the years, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few minutes they were back scanning a new part of the spectrum. The computers will check a persistent signal five times, moving the telescope on and off it, before calling someone to discuss it -- ''whoever is on the desk,'' Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next step would be to call the director of an observatory to the west (since that is the way the sky rotates) and ask for continued observation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've gotten six hours into it four times,'' Dr. Tarter said. One dramatic moment was in 1998, when Dr. Tarter and her colleagues were working at the observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., and had a signal they could just not eliminate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally they figured out that they were actually receiving transmissions from the European SOHO satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went to bed,'' Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a real adrenaline pumping time,'' she added. ''I can't imagine what the real deal will be.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAT CREEK, Calif. — E.T. might be phoning, but do we care enough to take the call?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating on money and equipment scrounged from the public and from Silicon Valley millionaires, and on the stubborn strength of their own dreams, a band of astronomers recently restarted one of the iconic quests of modern science, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — SETI, for short — which had been interrupted last year by a lack of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, a brace of 42 radio telescopes, known as the Allen Telescope Array[http://www.seti.org/ata], nestled here in the shadow of Lassen Peak, came to life and resumed hopping from star to star in the constellation Cygnus, listening for radio broadcasts from alien civilizations. The lines are now open, but with lingering financial problems, how long they will remain that way is anybody’s guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These should be boom times for those seeking out aliens, or at least their radio proxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers now know that the galaxy is teeming with at least as many planets — the presumed sites of life — as stars. Advanced life and technology might be rare in the cosmos, said Geoffrey W. Marcy[http://tinyurl.com/ylzlepe], the Watson and Marilyn Alberts in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence[http://ls.berkeley.edu/arts-ideas/archive/geoff-marcy-appointed-alberts-chair-0] professor at the University of California, Berkeley, “but surely they are out there, because the number of Earthlike planets in the Milky Way galaxy is simply too great.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple “howdy,” a squeal or squawk, or an incomprehensible stream of numbers captured by one of the antennas here at the University of California’s Hat Creek Radio Observatory[http://www.hcro.org/] would be enough to end our cosmic loneliness and change history, not to mention science. It would answer one of the most profound questions humans ask: Are we alone in the universe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite decades of space probes and billions of NASA dollars looking for life out there, there is still only one example of life in the universe: the DNA-based web of biology on Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. “In this field,” said Jill Tarter[http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/staff/jill-tarter], an astronomer at the SETI Institute[http://www.seti.org/] in Mountain View, Calif., the “number two is the all-important number. We count one, two, infinity. We’re all looking for number two.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story of SETI is the story of a dream deferred by politics, a lack of money and the technological challenges of searching what astronomers call “the cosmic haystack”: 100 billion stars in the galaxy and 9 billion narrow-band radio channels on which aliens, if they exist, might be trying to hail us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politics and the recession have crimped astronomers’ budgets and left the institute’s scientists with a kind of siege mentality. Last spring, the University of California ran out of money[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2067855,00.html] to run the Hat Creek observatory, forcing the Allen telescopes into hibernation. In order to continue the search, astronomers are negotiating a deal to share the telescopes with the Air Force, which wants to use them to track satellites and space junk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No federal funds have been spent searching for radio signals from extraterrestrials since 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent visit to the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span>’s Mountain View offices found many of the cubicles empty and the corridors eerily quiet. Last summer, as the Allen telescopes slumbered, weeds grew around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">998,000 Stars to Go</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story begins with a young radio astronomer named Frank Drake[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/weekinreview/02overbye.html], who pointed an antenna from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., at a pair of stars in 1960, wondering if he could make contact with anything or anyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All he got was static, but the hook was set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1971, NASA held a workshop led by Barney Oliver, the research chief of <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, that concluded the best way to find extraterrestrials was with a $10 billion array of giant radio telescopes called Cyclops. The price tag — as well as the subject — set off alarm bells that still reverberate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1978, Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, an outspoken critic of what he considered wasteful government spending, awarded one of his infamous “Golden Fleece” awards to the hunt for aliens, and in 1993, a NASA-sponsored survey for signals from 1,000 nearby stars was canceled by Congress. With the help of friends like Dr. Oliver in the Silicon Valley, Dr. Tarter and her colleagues took the search private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the director of SETI research at the institute, Dr. Tarter, 67, has become the public face of the cause, and she was consulted by the actress Jodie Foster about her portrayal of Ellie Arroway, a radio astronomer who finds a signal, in the movie “Contact.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter was recruited in 1976, when, as a postdoctorate student at Berkeley, she read the Cyclops report, a rite of passage for most alien-oriented astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You didn’t have to ask a priest or philosopher about life in the universe,” Dr. Tarter said. But she realized she was in the first generation who could conduct experiments about it. A half-century and roughly 2,000 stars later, humanity is still officially alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Drake is undaunted, noting that there are 100 billion suitable stars in the galaxy. His personal estimate, based on an equation he invented in 1961, is that there are 10,000 technological civilizations in the galaxy, one per million stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve known all along we have to look at a million stars,” he said. Now a cherubic 81, Dr. Drake is a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a former chairman of the SETI Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Allen Array, which was designed to find Dr. Drake his million stars, is named after Paul G. Allen, the <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder and philanthropist, who put up $25 million to get the project going. Jointly owned and operated by the University of California, Berkeley, and the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span>, it was to consist of 350 antennas, 20 feet in diameter, that were to be mass-produced like satellite dishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full array would be able to map a swath of sky several full moons in diameter in only 10 minutes, or the whole sky in a night — of great interest to astronomers and, as it turned out, to the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Allen’s contribution was only enough to build 42 antennas, which started operating in 2007. The astronomers say that another $55 million would complete the array, but there have been no volunteers yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project got a lift in 2009 when Dr. Tarter won a $100,000 prize and “One Wish to Change the World” at the TED conference — short for Technology, Entertainment and Design — in Long Beach, Calif. Her talk there began, “The story of humans is the story of ideas.” It elicited a donation of valuable equipment from Dell and Intel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project got another lift — mainly psychological — last year when NASA, whose Kepler spacecraft[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/k/kepler_space_telescope/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is beaming back news about the patch of Cygnus that it surveys, published its first list of 1,235 exoplanet candidates[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/science/03planet.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Tarter told a conference of exoplanet hunters recently: “We’re not just pointing at stars. We’re pointing where you have shown us there are planets, and perhaps technologists.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recession and the cutbacks that followed wiped out the university’s funds to run the Hat Creek observatory just as it was getting started on a survey of Kepler’s planets. The Allen telescopes went quiet, and the astronomical staff left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appeal for financing went out on the institute’s Web site, which eventually brought in about $220,000 — roughly two months’ worth of operating expenses. Meanwhile, the Air Force was interested in using the radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array, Dr. Tarter explained, turns out to be adept at tracking satellites and space junk, a possibility first identified as early as 2004 in a memo by her husband, William Welch, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is known as Jack. “There’s a long tradition of radio astronomy and the military scratching each other’s backs,” Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under terms of an agreement still being negotiated, the Air Force will pay for a share of the operations at Hat Creek, which costs about $1.5 million (plus another $1 million a year to pay the astronomers). The money raised so far will buy a few months at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome All Species</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers started bringing their equipment back to Hat Creek in September. The place looked neglected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nobody had cut the weeds,” Dr. Tarter said. “It looked so sad.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, when Dr. Tarter and Dr. Welch returned to Hat Creek in Dr. Welch’s Cessna with a reporter in tow, the weeds had been cut and the antennas were majestically turning to a music only they could hear. Scattered across a meadow, they resembled the forest of satellite dishes you see outside events like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby in an unassuming ranch house, racks of electronics and computers hummed with life. The doormat read, “Welcome All Species.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, Dr. Tarter plopped down in front of a computer and watched with a suspicious eye as the display popped with a row of numbers indicating that a narrow-band signal — the signature of an artificial source — had been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She takes great pride in the fact that she and her colleagues have never published a false alarm, and she nodded approvingly as the telescope and computers went through the process of eliminating the new signal from consideration. The Earth’s motion will cause the frequency of a signal from the sky to drift in frequency, for example. The checklist has grown over the years, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few minutes they were back scanning a new part of the spectrum. The computers will check a persistent signal five times, moving the telescope on and off it, before calling someone to discuss it — “whoever is on the desk,” Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next step would be to call the director of an observatory to the west (since that is the way the sky rotates) and ask for continued observation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve gotten six hours into it four times,” Dr. Tarter said. One dramatic moment was in 1998, when Dr. Tarter and her colleagues were working at the observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., and had a signal they could just not eliminate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally they figured out that they were actually receiving transmissions from the European SOHO satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We went to bed,” Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a real adrenaline pumping time,” she added. “I can’t imagine what the real deal will be.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Is there intelligent life on other planets? How would scientists recognize extraterrestrial life? Should we be searching for life in the universe? In this lesson, students discuss the definition of life and the requirements for life, both on Earth and other planets. They learn about SETI, the search for extraterrestrial life, explore some of the challenges facing this field, and develop proposals seeking financing for aspects of SETI research to pitch to venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Student journals, computers with Internet access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Students respond to the following prompt in their journals:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few minutes, show the following video:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, ask: Do you agree or disagree with defining life as "a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution"? How closely does it mesh with the definition of life that you wrote down? Why is it important for scientists to identify a clear definition for life? What requirements do living organisms share? Would you expect these to be the same on other planets with different atmospheres? How might we recognize extraterrestrial life forms if they are not based in DNA? What might be the value of finding life on other planets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might also provide other definitions of life for students to consider and discuss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, take a quick poll. Tell students to raise their hands if they think life already exists on other planets or elsewhere in the universe, intelligent or otherwise. Ask: What conditions would life on other planets require? How might we detect life elsewhere in the galaxy, or even in other galaxies? Is it important to determine whether we are alone in the galaxy or the universe? You might have students share their thoughts by posting comments on our Student Opinion question "Do You Believe in Intelligent Alien Life?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| In the article "Search for Aliens Is on Again, but Next Quest Is Finding Money," Dennis Overbye reports on the challenges facing astronomers searching for life beyond our planet:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| For discussion and reading comprehension:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| Explain to the class that they will develop proposals for a "pitch summit," in which groups will "pitch" the value of SETI to mock "potential investors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell them to call to mind real-life investors in space exploration, like Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft who financed the initial development of the Allen Telescope Array in California, or Sir Richard Branson, whose ventures include the space tourism company Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Divide the class into groups, and assign each group one of the following topics or roles:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Task: To convince the investors of the likelihood of extraterrestrial life and provide evidence for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topics to Cover: Why some astronomers believe that there must be extraterrestrial life in the galaxy; some ways scientists are searching for it; the Drake equation and how scientists use this calculation; what defines intelligent life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Task: To explain why money should be spent on SETI and make the case for why private investors should finance it, even when the government does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topics to Cover: What scientists should do if they find strong evidence of life on another planet, like making contact or attempting to travel to another civilization; the benefits to investors (and humankind) of taking part in such an endeavor; answers to the question "Is it better that we don't know if other civilizations exist?"; the value of SETI as opposed to some other government expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Task: To explain how radio telescopes work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topics to Cover: What information SETI scientists are trying to collect and how they are doing it; what kinds of signals might indicate intelligent life on other planets; the field of astrobiology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Task: Prepare for the pitch summit by exploring other areas of research and development in aerospace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topics to Cover: The future of space flight; identifying arguments for and against financing SETI research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When students have completed preparing their pitches, they should make short presentations to the team of "investors," perhaps using a tool like PowerPoint. The goal of the presentation teams is to make the presentations both explanatory and persuasive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the presentations are made, the "investors" should ask critical questions of the teams, asking them to explain why their areas of research is deserving of private financing, and why the financing shouldn't instead go to other kinds of space-based research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When all of the students have finished their presentations, allow a few minutes for the investors to decide whether to finance SETI, based on the pitches, and then briefly explain their decision to the presenters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To conclude, ask the whole class to share thoughts on whether we should continue the search to answer the question of whether humans on Earth are alone in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">| After watching the movie "Contact" or another classroom-worthy film featuring the search for or contact with extraterrestrial life, students write reviews of the film from both a scientific and a social perspective. How realistic is the science portrayed in the movie? Does the film seems to be informed by some of the science you just learned about? What attitudes do the filmmakers seem to have about extraterrestrials and about the search for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts in every previous spacewalk, or extra-vehicular activity, had been attached to the spacecraft by a long cable. Captain McCandless and Colonel Stewart used 300-pound nitrogen-propelled backpacks known as manned maneuvering units to make their way through space. The men made two spacewalks during the mission, the second occurring on Feb. 9. The first lasted 5 hours 55 minutes and the second was 6 hours 17 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2012, the Republican candidate Newt Gingrich pledged that, if elected president, he would make building a colony on the moon by 2020 a priority for the United States. His proposal was widely ridiculed, though The Times's Kenneth Chang reported that it is not as far-fetched as one might believe: "The answers seem to be technologically yes, economically iffy and politically very difficult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 7, 1984, two Challenger space shuttle astronauts, Capt. Bruce McCandless II and Col.l Robert L. Stewart, performed the first untethered spacewalk during the STS-41B mission. "Free of any lifeline and propelled into the dark void by tiny jets, they became, in effect, the first human satellites, " reported the Feb. 8 New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts used the extra-vehicular activity to simulate the procedures that were planned for the capture and repair of a malfunctioning satellite on a future mission. That objective was carried out in April 1984, when two astronauts successfully repaired the Solar Max satellite while using manned maneuvering units. In November of that same year, two STS-51A astronauts used their manned maneuvering units to retrieve two malfunctioning communications satellites, the Westar VI and Palapa B2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manned maneuvering units used by Captain McCandless and Colonel Stewart were not used again after 1984, as NASA decided to perform only tethered spacewalks for safety reasons. In 1994, NASA unveiled a new backpack called Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue, or Safer, and tested it with an untethered spacewalk, the fourth, and thus far last untethered extra-vehicular activity it has performed. Every astronaut at the International Space Station wears Safer, which is smaller and lighter than the manned maneuvering units, for use during an emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think Mr. Gingrich's plan for the development of an American lunar colony would be a wise use of federal funds and resources? Why or why not? When it comes to space exploration in general, do you think individual countries should have the right to stake claim to or "colonize" the moon or other planets? Why or why not?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARMEL VALLEY, Calif. -- Just in time for Valentine's Day comes the ultimate gift for the Dr. Strangelove in your life: the 21,000-square-foot Jamesburg Earth Station, a satellite relay base from the 1960s that was built to survive a nuclear attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perched on a remote hillside overlooking the Ventana Wilderness here on California's Central Coast, it is a white elephant that costs $3 million, a tech-lover's paradise on 161 acres equipped with a 97-foot satellite dish. (Though the signs reading ''Danger: High Voltage'' are perhaps not the best marketing tool.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its glory days, this sprawling bunkerlike redoubt on Comsat Road played an essential role in national life. Built in 1968 by the Communications Satellite Corporation, the Jamesburg Earth Station and nearly a dozen others like it helped bring the first televised images of Neil Armstrong on the moon and President Richard M. Nixon in Beijing into America's living rooms. They also pulled in signals from satellites in geostationary orbit that made international telephone calls fast and easily accessible for most Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the ultimate man cave,'' said Jeffrey W. Bullis, a Silicon Valley electronics mogul, who bought the property in 2004 for $2 million from <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> and is now selling it, complete with the hand-carved Tiki gods from Vanuatu that he placed at the entrance as a homey touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiber optics made the station's technology obsolete. Mr. Bullis, 56, who develops security systems for nuclear plants and other sites, had hoped to develop an Internet business there. When that did not prove feasible, he said, he proceeded with Plan B: turning the Jamesburg Earth Station into a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is Love,'' he said during a tour, indicating one of the would-be bedrooms that he christened on the building's perimeter. ''This is Peace. This is Happiness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A time-stood-still feeling pervades the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one room, there are 14 file cabinets of blueprints, seemingly untouched for decades; in another, the dusty air filtration system emits a low wheeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cinder block walls are lined with vintage cold war images: a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll and a nighttime shot of an Intelsat II satellite launching in a cometlike streak of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Ramey, 69, a retired technical supervisor at the station, said he had fond memories of the Operational Room, the size of a football field, where he and his colleagues, many of them retired military personnel, worked in jackets and ties in front of control panels. The highlight of his career, he said, was being able to listen to astronauts on a mission, and he recalled the fleeting ''concern'' in the voices of the Apollo 10 crew members in May 1969 as they scoped out the moon in anticipation of the first landing by Apollo 11 that summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bullis set up an adjoining room as an indoor shooting range, stacking it with hay bales for target practice with a variety of weapons, including his prized .375 H&amp;H Magnum. ''You name it, we've shot it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He mostly lives in Redwood City, Calif., between San Francisco and San Jose. The home that Mr. Bullis built there is a replica of a stone manor house that he had admired in Bayonne, France. He had planned to make the earth station his weekend home, and he tweaked the dish's position from a right angle to a position parallel to the ground so that it looks like it is levitating by the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hoped to transform the operations center into a living room and master bedroom separated by a circular fire pit, and hired R. Wayne Johnson, a local architect and engineer, to reimagine the place as a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said ''it's a very stable building,'' with a five-foot reinforced-concrete roof and double layers of reinforced steel. ''We envisioned a flow between interior and exterior,'' he added, including the use of folding glass panels that would lead to an outdoor dining area overlooking chardonnay grape vineyards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bullis abandoned his plans for the station and decided to sell when his youngest son, Adam, died of leukemia at age 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deluge of ''tire kickers and yahoos'' showed up, said Bert Aronson, a broker with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Carmel, Calif., who is the listing agent. So he decided to market the property online at jamesburgearthstation.com and valleyvintagestorage.com to better screen interested buyers. Mr. Aronson says potential uses include wine or car storage or a computer data center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Saffo, who forecasts technology trends in Silicon Valley, said that he hoped the buyer would appreciate the earth station's history and that it would be perfect for an amateur astronomer. ''It's in the danger zone,'' he said. ''Someone is going to have to be really crazy and really rich to buy it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Vanderbilt, the author of ''Survival City: Adventures Among the Ruins of Atomic America,'' noted that many cold war structures had been abandoned, ''too old to be technologically useful but too new to be venerated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They exist,'' he said, ''in cultural limbo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jamesburg Earth Station is the equivalent of a frontier fort, ''the frontier being the militarized battleground of space,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, with Newt Gingrich using his presidential campaign to talk about the danger of an ''electromagnetic pulse'' attack, perhaps the earth station will develop a new generation of survivalist fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, its recreational possibilities make for potentially riveting cocktail chatter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, Mr. Bullis decided to use the satellite dish for a ''moon bounce,'' projecting his voice into space and back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love life,'' he confessed to the moon. ''I love my country. I love my family. And I love this place.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the winter of 1962, the nation needed a hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans had yet to recover from the Soviet Union's launching of the first spacecraft, Sputnik, in October 1957 -- a rude jolt to our confidence as world leaders in all things technological. The space race was on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy had thrown down the challenge to send men to the Moon by the end of the decade. But the Russians still set the pace, boastfully. They launched a dog into orbit, then the first man, Yuri A. Gagarin, and another, Gherman S. Titov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States lagged, managing only two 15-minute suborbital astronaut flights -- only five minutes of weightlessness each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Feb. 20, 1962 -- 50 years ago next Monday -- a Marine Corps fighter pilot from small-town America stepped forward in response to the country's need. The astronaut was John Glenn, whom the author Tom Wolfe has called ''the last true national hero America has ever had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squeezed into the cockpit of a Mercury spacecraft called Friendship 7, launched by an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla., Mr. Glenn circled the Earth three times, becoming the first American to orbit the planet. Perhaps no other spaceflight -- all 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds of it -- has been followed by so many with such paralyzing apprehension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn saw three sunsets and sunrises that Tuesday, from a maximum altitude of 162 miles. At each sunrise, an explosion of what looked like fireflies appeared outside the window, mystifying him. Then came a signal of a suspected problem that had ground controllers bracing for an uncertain, possibly catastrophic re-entry into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ending was a happy one. A collective sigh of relief was heard across the land. The president rushed off to Cape Canaveral to hail the returning hero. Bands played. Ticker tape streamed from the high windows of Broadway. People cried. Never mind that a Soviet cosmonaut had already spent 25 hours in orbit. As Mr. Wolfe has written, ''John Glenn made us whole again!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at 90, Mr. Glenn was reminded in one of two lengthy interviews that the author of ''The Right Stuff'' had judged him the country's last true hero. His response was a kind of dismissive aw shucks. ''Hero'' is an elastic word, after all, stretchable to fit a favorite ballplayer or a great conqueror in war or discovery -- almost anyone admirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think of myself that way,'' Mr. Glenn said. ''I get up each day and have the same problems others have at my age. As far as trying to analyze all the attention I received, I will leave that to others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(For his part, Mr. Wolfe stood by his characterization, saying a national hero was someone seen as ''a great protector'' of the people. ''He really wasn't their protector, but that's what people felt and thought,'' he said of Mr. Glenn in an interview last week. ''He made them cry, and this made him a hero.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, Mr. Glenn will again get a hero's welcome at Cape Canaveral for a reunion with the dwindling Mercury space team, those remaining managers, engineers and technicians who sent the first Americans into space. On Monday and Tuesday, he will be honored with a dinner and a spaceflight forum at Ohio State University, home of the John Glenn School of Public Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn keeps an office at the school, holds seminars with students and is close to the archive of papers from his careers as an astronaut and, later, a four-term United States senator from Ohio and a candidate in the 1984 Democratic presidential primaries. It is quite an archive: about 1,800 boxes of materials. ''I was a pack rat,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Anna (he calls her Annie), divide their time between a house in a suburb of Washington and a condominium in Columbus. She was his childhood sweetheart, and their marriage has stood the test of almost 69 years of devotion in the turbulence of spaceflight and politics. From the time they came to public attention, each has seemed the other's center of gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through years of therapy, Mr. Glenn said, Annie has overcome the severe stammer that had made her ill at ease at public appearances. ''She can give speeches now,'' he said, and she likes talking to students of speech pathology. Both have had knee-replacement surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their knees had made it hard for them, especially Annie, to climb on the wing and into the cabin of their twin-engine Beechcraft Baron. They used to fly it on vacations and back and forth to Washington, sometimes logging as many as 160 airborne hours a year. Last month, as a concession to their aging knees, the Glenns sold their airplane, but Mr. Glenn was pleased to say he still has a valid pilot's license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other honored guest at the anniversary events in Cape Canaveral will be M. Scott Carpenter, the Mercury astronaut who was Mr. Glenn's backup and radio link, called capcom, in the launching blockhouse that day of flight. The two are the only surviving members of what were known as the Mercury Seven. Virgil I. Grissom died in 1967 in an Apollo spacecraft fire during a launching-pad test. Donald K. Slayton died of cancer in 1993. Alan B. Shepard Jr. died of leukemia in 1998. L. Gordon Cooper Jr. died of natural causes in 2004. Walter M. Schirra Jr. died of a heart attack in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, his last year in the Senate, the first American to orbit Earth became, at 77, the oldest person to travel in space. Mr. Glenn felt he still had enough of the right stuff. He had continued to pilot his own airplane and had kept in shape -- ''attitude and exercise,'' he said, ''that's what keeps you going'' -- and he persuaded NASA to let him fly on the space shuttle Discovery and conduct tests on the physiological effects of nine days of weightlessness on older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recent interviews, Mr. Glenn said, ''I am not at all happy with some of the directions the space program is going, in particular retiring the space shuttles before we have a new heavy-lift launching system in place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn said he was concerned that since the final shuttle flight last July, the United States must depend on the Russian Soyuz space vehicles for ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station, assembled in orbit at a cost well over $100 billion, mainly from American taxpayers. The Soyuz is limited to three passengers and about 125 pounds of gear, hardly sufficient for hauling replacement parts for the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the Russians had a hiccup with Soyuz, our manned space program would be ended, maybe for years,'' Mr. Glenn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a meeting with President Obama two years ago, Mr. Glenn made his case for continuing shuttle flights and full space station operations for several more years, contrary to President George W. Bush's policy that a new generation of boosters and spacecraft would be developed with the savings from the cancellation of shuttle operations. ''The president didn't disagree with any of my arguments,'' he recalled. ''He said we just don't have the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Glenn settled into recollections of that February day in 1962, the interview glided into easy conversation over shared memories. Ten times over almost a month the launching was scheduled, only to be scrubbed because of poor weather or mechanical glitches. ''On again, off again,'' Mr. Glenn said. ''I actually suited up four times, and two times was up on top of the Atlas, strapped into Friendship 7, ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporters from all over the world grew restive, desperate for anything to write about. After one cancellation, Mercury information officers begged Mr. Glenn to give them something to tell the journalists. When he got off the booster, he went running on the beach and happened to see where sea turtles had buried their eggs. This was duly reported, and one writer remarked that it was understood the astronaut had a good recipe for turtle egg soup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well, that got me into a whole lot of trouble with environmentalists,'' Mr. Glenn recalled. ''I got mail calling me everything but a good guy, and should be replaced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waiting got so tiresome for the press corps that when a waitress at one of the watering holes was shot dead by her boyfriend around midnight, some reporters rushed to file the story. A London tabloid declared it ''the first successful shot here in weeks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn said he had not heard that tale before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last, on the 11th attempt, with his backup, Mr. Carpenter, bidding ''Godspeed, John Glenn,'' Friendship 7 lifted off for its three orbits of Earth. Christopher C. Kraft Jr., the flight director, remembers, ''Nothing about John Glenn's flight was easy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first sunrise, Mr. Glenn saw a swarm of greenish-yellow lights outside the craft, reminding him of fireflies. He saw them again at the other sunrises. ''No one had anticipated this, and it was fascinating,'' he said. ''Turns out these were tiny moisture particles vented from the heat-exchange system, but I don't know if we have ever explained their particular colors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near the end of the first orbit, trouble with the automatic control system forced Mr. Glenn to take manual control for much of the remaining orbits. He felt he was truly the pilot, not a passenger on autopilot. Not ''Spam in a can,'' in the minds of the veteran test pilots unimpressed by these new astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then a signal sent to the ground warned of a potentially more serious problem. It indicated that the craft had a loose heat shield. Flight controllers suspected it was a spurious signal, but could not be sure. They decided not to jettison the retro rockets after they braked the capsule for its descent. The retro-pack should keep the heat shield in place and prevent serious damage to the capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Glancing out the window during re-entry,'' Mr. Glenn recalled, ''I was seeing big chunks of something coming off. It was the retro-pack, not the heat shield, thank goodness. It had been a false alarm. If you go to the Air and Space Museum in Washington, you can see the burn patterns on Friendship 7.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the epilogue to ''The Right Stuff,'' his best seller on the original seven astronauts, Mr. Wolfe wrote that the day of Glenn the hero ''when an astronaut could parade up Broadway while traffic policemen wept in the intersections,'' was no more. An era, he continues, ''had come, and it had gone, perhaps never to be relived.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a time short of heroes, John Glenn keeps alive the memory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHILE training for the International Space Station, I was constantly flying to Houston, Moscow, Tokyo, Montreal and Cologne. I used to joke that I had more Earth orbits sitting in coach class than in the space shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I let my wife use my frequent flier miles to make up for the fact that I was gone so often. I was getting a ride to space, and I figured she should get something out of it, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During one such trip, I traveled west from Houston to Tokyo, then on to Moscow and finally to Orlando, Fla., to attend a space shuttle launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I checked into my hotel, the fellow behind the front desk looked at my driver's license and said, ''Houston, eh? Well, you sure have come a long way.'' To which I replied, ''You have no idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I still travel a lot as an engineer for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, and I try and keep everything in perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one month after returning to Earth, I traveled to Vancouver to visit the set of the television show, ''Battlestar Galactica.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I left the set about 3 in the morning, and drove to Seattle to catch a flight to Dallas, where I then caught a flight to La Guardia. The plan was to meet some friends that evening at one of my favorite places, Pete's Tavern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip took the better part of a whole day. Drinking a pint of beer, I had the sudden realization that I really had come back to Earth since that same trip in orbit took about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unruly passengers get a lot of attention. There are some people who know how to handle the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we traveled back to Moscow from Sevastopol, Ukraine, after completing water survival training with the Russian Navy, there was a drunk sitting in the row of seats in front of me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When his behavior became intolerable, my fellow astronaut looked around for a flight attendant. But our Russian cosmonaut commander stood up, put the drunk guy in a headlock, dragged him through the aisle of the Tupolev jet and threw him into an open row of seats in the rear of the plane with a threat to kill him if he moved before landing. It worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've seen some strange things, too, like a guy in France getting naked at the security line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was in the transit area, getting a bite to eat, and glanced over at security. One guy was clueless about what to do, and after removing his shoes, he started taking off his jacket, tie and shirt. He was moving really quickly and everyone was kind of stunned, including me. Then he removed his pants, and went for his underwear. Fortunately, security ran over just in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not big on talking to seatmates. I learned my lesson. You say you're an astronaut and the first thing someone wants to know is how an astronaut goes to the bathroom. It's not that complicated, but I am tired of answering the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, when people ask me what I do, I say I'm an engineer involved in human-vehicle interaction. It's not like I'm lying, but it's usually a conversation stopper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if I'm sitting next to a youngster, I'll talk the entire flight. They'll often ask what I liked most about being on the space station. I always give the same answer -- floating in zero gravity. It's like being Superman and never gets boring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children are fascinated with space travel and exploring the unknown. Maybe, like them, we just need to look out the window more when we fly. There's a lot of wonder out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How often do you fly?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. About twice a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's your least favorite airport?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Charles de Gaulle. I got stranded there once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Of all the places you've been, what's the best?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Catalina Island. There's great snorkeling and scuba diving. Plus, as an astronaut and pilot, I think it's super fun when you land there because of the cliffs on either end of the runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's your secret airport vice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I like to mooch free Internet access, mostly in European airports, by grabbing a baggage cart and hanging outside elite lounges where I can pick up a signal and then hack in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swiss scientists say they plan to launch a ''janitor satellite'' specially designed to get rid of orbiting debris known as space junk. The $11 million satellite, called CleanSpace One, the prototype for a family of spacecraft, is being built by the Swiss Space Center at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Lausanne. The institute said Wednesday that the satellite's launching would come within three to five years, and that its first tasks would be to retrieve two Swiss satellites that went into orbit in 2009 and 2010. According to NASA, more than 500,000 pieces of spent rocket stages, satellites and other debris are in orbit now and are moving fast enough to damage a satellite or spacecraft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious sign that there is a lot of junk in space is how much of it has been falling out of the sky lately: a defunct NASA satellite last year, a failed Russian space probe this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the odds are tiny that anyone on Earth will be hit, the chances that all this orbiting litter will interfere with working satellites or the International Space Station are getting higher, according to a recent report by the National Research Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit group, which dispenses advice on scientific matters, concluded that the problem of extraterrestrial clutter had reached a point where, if nothing was done, a cascade of collisions would eventually make low-Earth orbit unusable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA is taking it very seriously,'' said Mason A. Peck, chief technologist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a straightforward solution: dispose of the space junk, especially big pieces, before they collide and break into smaller ones. Researchers are stepping in with a variety of creative solutions, including nets that would round up wayward items and drag them into the Earth's atmosphere, where they would harmlessly burn up, and balloons that would similarly direct the debris into the atmosphere. Also on the table: firing lasers from the ground. Not to blow things up, which would only make more of a mess, but to nudge them into safer orbits or into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week, researchers at a top Swiss university, the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, announced that they were designing CleanSpace One, a sort of vacuum cleaner in the sky -- an $11 million one -- that will be able to navigate close to a satellite and grab it with a big claw, whereupon both will make a fiery death dive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss have only two satellites in orbit, each smaller than a breadbox, but they are concerned about what to do with them when they stop operating in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to clean up after ourselves,'' said Anton Ivanov, a scientist at the institute's space center. ''That's very Swiss, isn't it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space junk problem is so old and widely acknowledged that it even has a name: the Kessler Syndrome. In 1978, Donald J. Kessler, who led NASA's office of space debris, first predicted the cascade effect that would take place when leftover objects in space started colliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Dr. Kessler is retired in North Carolina but still contemplating the issue -- and the need to clean up. ''The sooner they do it, the cheaper it will be,'' he said. ''The more you wait to start, the more you'll have to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many items whizzing around at more than 17,000 miles per hour and shattering as they crash, the threat to working satellites, which are vital to hurricane tracking, GPS systems and military surveillance, has grown more immediate. Three years ago, a derelict Russian satellite slammed into an Iridium communications satellite, smashing both into tens of thousands of pieces. The Air Force currently tracks 20,000 pieces of orbiting space junk, which includes old rocket parts and dead satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the risk is real but manageable. Satellite operators can dodge the big debris and armor their satellites to withstand impact with smaller pieces. But eventually, if not cleaned up, low-Earth orbit would become too perilous for people and satellites. ''It will be a huge risk for an astronaut to go to space,'' said John L. Junkins, a professor of aerospace engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, adding: ''No one will insure a space launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has about 500 pieces of large space junk, Dr. Junkins said, and Russia about twice that number. ''I'm talking about going after things the size of a Greyhound bus,'' he said. ''Absolutely, this is the heart of the problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking down five or six of the large intact objects each year would be enough to halt the cascade effect, he said. Eliminating 10 a year would quickly reverse the trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has started financing research to come up with some solutions. <span class="companylink">Raytheon</span>, for one, is studying whether a high-altitude balloon might be able to carry a machine that would essentially shoot puffs of air into the path of orbiting debris. Even that slight increase in atmospheric drag could force junk to fall back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It actually doesn't require much,'' said Dr. Peck, NASA's chief technologist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA just gave $1.9 million to Star Technology and Research, a small company in South Carolina, to develop and test technologies for a spacecraft it calls the ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator -- Edde, for short. Powered by a 6-mile-long wire -- make that ''space tether'' -- that generates energy as it is pulled through the Earth's magnetic field, Edde would sidle up to a piece of junk, whip out a disposable net to catch it and then move to a lower orbit, where air friction would coax the item to re-enter the atmosphere. Edde, staying in orbit, would then move on to its next target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerome Pearson, the president of Star Technology, says it would take only a few years and a few hundred million dollars for a fleet of Eddes to clean up the near-Earth neighborhood. (Others suspect that it would take longer and cost more.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology is just one hurdle. International politics might be a more serious one. Space junk, even if it is just junk, still belongs to the nation that put it there. So if the United States tried to lasso part of a spent Russian rocket, Russia would most likely protest. Many nations would certainly worry that a ground-based laser capable of pushing satellites around would also be wielded as a weapon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the space junk problem will not be solved unless everyone launching rockets stops adding to it. The United States has largely done that: all new satellites are now accompanied by plans for how to bring them safely out of orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested setting up a code of conduct for nations to follow, but that may be more easily said than done. European countries have also been putting together a set of ground rules, but the United States called them too restrictive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Junkins of Texas A&amp;M said the United States should not wait for new international agreements, but instead follow the example of the Swiss in cleaning up after itself. ''The U.S. alone could reverse the growth by tackling the several hundred things that we've put there that are our responsibility,'' he said. ''That gives us the moral and technical high ground.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have discovered a new planet in our galaxy that is unlike any other found so far: Both the planet and its atmosphere are mostly water, though none of it is liquid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, GJ1214b, has a diameter 2.7 times that of Earth, and it weighs seven times as much. It probably has much more water than Earth -- in the form of steam and a peculiar high-temperature ice that exists at extremely high pressures -- and far less rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's probably nothing too special about this planet itself,'' said Zachory K. Berta, an astronomer at Harvard University who was involved with the research. The main thing, he added, is that ''we have the opportunity to really see the density of the planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues report their findings in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To estimate the density and diameter, they measured the color of the light from the star that shines through the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're observing the sunset on this planet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the planet was discovered with a ground-based telescope, the data that allowed Mr. Berta and his colleagues to estimate the planet's mass and density was gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the researchers have two goals. The first is to learn more about the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to study this atmosphere,'' Mr. Berta said, ''and work on the details so we can really try to understand what's going on.'' The second goal is to find more planets. Using the same techniques, the astronomers can study the atmosphere of other planets in detail, and Mr. Berta said a slightly smaller, slightly cooler planet might be capable of supporting life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar storms like the one that buffeted Earth's magnetic field on Thursday will soon become a common occurrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnetic eruptions on the Sun on Tuesday and Wednesday released two huge bursts of lights -- two of the largest solar flares over the last five years -- and accelerated a blob of high-speed particles headed toward us. As the charged particles slam in the Earth's magnetic field, funneled toward the north and south poles, they generate the nighttime light now known as auroras or northern and southern lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant solar storms can wreak havoc on satellites and power grids. One storm knocked out power in a large swath in Quebec in 1989. The current storm, which started Thursday morning, is nowhere large enough to cause that much trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this point it's a minor storm," said C. Alex Young, a senior solar physicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html] in Greenbelt, Md. "It's not going to be that big even if the levels increase a bit. This is really not something to be concerned about."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said in a statement on Wednesday[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/News030712-X5-4.html] that two large solar flares would send "a severe geomagnetic storm" toward Earth that could cause "possible disruption to high frequency radio communication, global positioning systems (GPS) and power grids." The space agency added:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the August 2011 X-class flare, the last time the sun sent out flares of this magnitude was in 2006. There was an X6.5 on Dec. 6, 2006, and an X9.0 on Dec. 5, 2006. Like the most recent events, those two flares erupted from the same region on the sun, which is a common occurrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That announcement caused a storm of its own, sparking numerous hyperbolic reports about possible dangers to air travel and communications systems from large clouds of charged particles rushing toward Earth at millions of miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm particles started arriving Thursday morning, and the intensity could reach the "strong" category, or 3, on the 1 to 5 scale used to categorize such storms. A similar-size storm also hit Earth in late January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BREAKING: Big solar storm reaches Earth; no trouble reported. -EF</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- The Associated Press (@AP) March 8, 2012[https://twitter.com/AP/status/177781373057236992]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a five-year lull in strong solar storms, because the ferocity and pace of the Sun's flares and magnetic eruptions rise and fall on an 11-year cycle, and the Sun has only recently emerged from its slumber and started generating new solar flares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting the first few snowfalls of the year, so to speak," said Robert Rutledge, lead of the forecast office at the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colo., part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the course of a typical 11-year cycle, some 200 solar storms as strong as Thursday's will hit Earth. Even though the current cycle appears quieter than usual, at the peak of the cycle, expected in the next year or so[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html], solar storms as strong as Thursday's will likely hit the Earth a few times a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the cycle matches the usual pattern, about one-tenth as many of the solar storms - 10 to 20 - would reach the stronger, "severe" level and one or two would be described as "extreme."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the most powerful storms that generate real worry. In addition to knocking out power grids, the larger solar storms can also damage satellites or pose a health hazard to astronauts on the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think people should really be concerned unless an extreme solar storm is headed toward Earth," Dr. Young said. "We want the general public to be aware of it and know what's going on but at the same time not losing sleep over it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] is on the cusp of answering the most fascinating questions about Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — is there, was there or could there be life there? — the money needed to provide the answers is about to be abruptly withdrawn, a victim of President Obama’s budget request for 2013, scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two ambitious missions that NASA had hoped to launch to Mars, in 2016 and 2018, will be canceled. The first would have sent an orbiter to measure gases in the Martian atmosphere — methane in particular, since methane does not last long. Its presence could suggest that Martian microbes are busy at work emitting the gas (though other explanations are also possible).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second, in 2018, would have set the stage to fulfill the longstanding desire of scientists to bring pieces of Mars back to Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] for close-up study with the full arsenal of instruments available in their laboratories. Now the prospect of bringing Martian rocks to Earth is likely pushed to the mid- or late 2020s, all because of budget cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The pipeline is being shut off, and that’s not what anyone wants,” said Bill Nye, executive director of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit group founded by Carl Sagan and others who wanted to foster interest in outer space. “We are closer than anyone has ever been to discovering life on another world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama’s budget request for 2013 calls for cutting NASA’s robotic exploration of the solar system by 20 percent, to $1.2 billion, and the Mars program would be particularly hard hit. Already, NASA has withdrawn from a collaboration with the European Space Agency that would have launched the missions in 2016 and 2018, angering the Europeans and disappointing astrobiologists and planetary scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We seem to have gotten the drastic cuts relative to other parts of NASA,” said Raymond E. Arvidson, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. “Why?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still a few tidbits left. A NASA rover called Curiosity is to land in August and look in ancient sediments for carbon-based molecules that could serve as the building blocks of life. Its instruments could also confirm the controversial claim that Mars’ atmosphere contains methane. But Curiosity will not be able to provide definitive answers to the question of “Could there have been life on Mars?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a modest orbiter mission called Maven, to study Mars’ upper atmosphere, remains on track for launching next year. By measuring the escape of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor to space, scientists hope to gain insight into the past climate of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists are dismayed that they are being hamstrung on the brink of major breakthroughs. The problem, they say, stems from NASA trying to cram too many big-ticket items into a $17.7 billion budget — $1.75 billion less than what Congress had promised a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now NASA’s Mars science exploration budget is being decimated,” Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. “We’re not going back to the moon. Plans for astronauts to visit Mars or anywhere beyond low-Earth orbit are delayed until the 2030s on funding not yet allocated, overseen by a Congress and a president to be named later.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson implored Congress to look beyond the near-term budget travails, noting that of each dollar in taxes sent to Washington, only half a cent is spent on NASA. He told the senators they should double NASA’s budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The moment the culture wants to innovate, that penny on a dollar becomes an investment,” Dr. Tyson said, arguing that the nation had benefited greatly from the halo effects of the space program in the 1960s and 1970s and has been coasting since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sidelining of the Mars program is one of several depressing developments at NASA. The space shuttles will never fly again, and the agency’s reliance on Russian rockets to ferry astronauts to the space station is likely to be extended, because financing of commercial companies to take over that task has been limited. The James Webb Space Telescope, meant as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/hubble_space_telescope/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], is delayed and over budget, now at least six years from being ready. The new heavy-lift rocket that is to take astronauts on faraway missions will not carry any astronauts until 2021. All of the big projects are slipping into the distant future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent March 5, a group of Mars scientists that provides feedback to NASA said it was “appalled” by the proposed budget cuts. “Among the many dire impacts, the cuts threaten the very existence of the Mars exploration program which has been one of the crown jewels of the agency’s planetary exploration,” wrote David J. Des Marais, a scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in California and chairman of the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Curiosity is already finished and launched, “from this point now forward, there is nothing active in the queue,” Dr. Des Marais said in an interview. “The gap begins now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency officials strongly dispute the notion that NASA is being idled. “We still have very exciting things to do in science,” said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA’s associate administrator for science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA will not have anything to launch to Mars in 2016, Dr. Grunsfeld said the agency was aiming to come up with a new mission to fill the 2018 slot. A planning group appointed by Dr. Grunsfeld is to provide a draft framework for a revised, cheaper Mars program this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Europeans could possibly turn to Russia as a new partner for the Mars missions that NASA will no longer pursue. While NASA has laid the groundwork of Mars exploration for the past 15 years, other nations could conceivably swoop in for the most significant discoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only NASA has had any success at landing on Mars, and more likely, whatever mysteries Mars holds will remain mysteries for years longer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space is not good for your eyes -- unless you are nearsighted, in which case it might help a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trips to weightlessness can squash the eyeballs of astronauts, swell the optic nerves and blur vision -- changes that often persist long after the astronauts return to weightbound Earth. That is one more health effect that NASA will have to worry about before astronauts venture farther out into the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're talking about missions that might be two years round trip, it has to be in the back of your mind that this could be a potential limiting factor,'' said Dr. Larry A. Kramer, a professor of diagnostic imaging and intervention at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kramer and his colleagues have put more than 35 astronauts into high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging machines. This month in the journal Radiology, they reported their findings on the first 27 astronauts they examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the 27 had some swelling around the optic nerve. In seven of the astronauts, the back of one or both of the eyeballs was somewhat flattened. Those abnormalities, Dr. Kramer said, resemble those in patients on terra firma who have a condition in which fluid pressure increases in the skull and presses against the eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kramer said he suspected increased pressure was at the heart of the problem for the astronauts, too. Without the downward pull of gravity, fluids in the body shift higher in the body, including inside the skull. (It is, however, too early to rule out other causes, he said, like the increased radiation that astronauts experience while in orbit.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flattening of the eyes is easily compensated for by eyeglasses, and nearsighted people become less nearsighted. But the M.R.I. scans also revealed little ripples in the back of the eyes of some of the astronauts, distorting their vision in a way that ''would be more disconcerting to us,'' Dr. Kramer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swelling, if untreated, could damage vision, possibly even leading to blindness. The astronauts who had spent longer time in space exhibited more abnormalities, although some of those who had floated in space for less than a month also had eye changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now taking measurements of the eyeballs of all new astronauts it selects and before and after each flight. ''This is a lifelong health issue for astronauts that they're going to be following,'' Dr. Kramer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since missions beyond low-Earth orbit are more than a decade away, NASA has time to figure out solutions. Drugs to alleviate the pressure are one possibility. A more technologically challenging solution would be to spin interplanetary spacecraft to generate artificial gravity for the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA does not currently think that the vision problem will preclude long-duration human space missions,'' said Dr. Richard Williams, NASA's chief health and medical officer, adding that the vision changes have so far had no effect on the ability of astronauts on the International Space Station to complete their missions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAT CREEK, Calif. -- On a chilly morning last week, Jill Tarter sat in a makeshift corner office facing the Allen Telescope Array, pondering a set of parallel lines that striped a window in her MacBook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter directs the Center for SETI Research -- SETI is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence -- and the 42 antennas that sit outside her window are once again sampling radio emissions from a patch of sky that offers a window into one of the spiral arms of our galaxy. Shuttered for more than a year by budget problems, the array was turned back on in December to continue its search. Now, the searchers have another reason for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With new Web-based software called SETILive, an army of independent citizen-scientists are being enlisted to help with the hunt for unusual signals. The software, which can be found at setilive.org, was designed by Zooniverse, a team of programmers and scientists who have created Web-based systems to enable citizen participation in research in fields like astronomy and marine biology. SETILive was switched on late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two weeks, more than 40,000 volunteers have signed up, and more than one million radio samples have been analyzed. (Another Zooniverse project, Galaxy Zoo, has enabled more than 600,000 amateur astronomers to help with classifying an immense number of deep-sky objects since 2007.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the remarkable revelations of the Kepler satellite mission, the searchers have a target list. Kepler has revealed thousands of planets relatively close to our solar system. Now, rather than sweeping the entire sky, the array of 42 antennas, spread over the countryside in the mountain valley here in Northern California, dart electronically from target to target, capturing snippets of what the watchers hope might be evidence of alien life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter, a 68-year-old astronomer, said the use of volunteers was an experiment. She is hoping that the SETI researchers can use human pattern recognition to fine-tune software algorithms that in the past have been used to look for tantalizing signals hidden among fields of natural stellar radiation and human-made sources of interference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a single cellphone can raise havoc with the sensitive antennas, which are supercooled and can scan a huge swath of the radio spectrum, from 1 to 10 gigahertz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time that SETI has looked to human volunteers. Over the past decade, the organization has used the Internet to weave together a virtual supercomputer called SETI@Home, analyzing roughly 160 terabytes of radio data collected by the radio telescope at Arecibo, P.R. More than six million volunteers have run the SETI@Home software on their desktop computers, and that project is now being extended to take advantage of the new information produced by the Kepler mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With SETILive, the researchers are hoping to add the power of the human mind to the scanning efforts. Projects in other fields have already proved the power of relatively untrained human participants. For example, Foldit, a project of University of Washington biochemists and computer scientists, developed a Web-based video game that treated protein-folding as a puzzle. The researchers were able to demonstrate that the game's players, many of them high school students with little background in biology, could outperform the best protein-folding algorithms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have software that finds narrow-band signals much better than your eye can,'' Dr. Tarter said. ''Basically what we're doing with humans is to see how well they do. We are giving them marking tools and learning how they extract features.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, she said, a huge challenge for the SETI researchers has been that the researchers have had to contend with powerful interference sources at the sites of their radio observatories from both Earth-based radars and satellite communications. The Allen telescope site here in Hat Creek is relatively free from interference sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also, of course, the ''drunk under the streetlight'' effect. SETI researchers have devoted much of their resources to the electromagnetic spectrum from 1 to 10 gigahertz because it offers a relatively quiet window for observation from within the Earth's atmosphere. If there were an alien civilization orbiting a nearby star, no one is really certain how they would choose to communicate with us. Radio or television broadcasts are a possibility, but so are powerful pulsed lasers and conceivably communications that employ some advanced phenomenon like quantum entanglement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade, because of the falling cost of advanced optical electronics detectors, some experiments have begun to take place at optical frequencies as well, Dr. Tarter said. Soon, optical experiments will also begin to look in the infrared portion of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, however, SETILive is adding a new, and already occasionally unpredictable, dimension to the hunt for alien worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since there is no absolute certainty about what a communication from another civilization might look like, the researchers are having to put up with some of the eccentricities of their volunteers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are expecting that every single thing they see is going to be a signal and so they're drawing patterns in noise,'' Dr. Tarter said. ''I had someone send me a face the other day. Here's a noise field, and he saw a face.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Crew members aboard the International Space Station temporarily scrambled into spacecraft capable of returning them to Earth early on Saturday as remnants of a discarded Russian satellite passed nearby, the latest episode spotlighting the growing amount of space debris encircling the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew -- three Russians, two Americans and a Dutch astronaut -- climbed into the two spacecraft as the debris passed within about nine miles of the space station, at 2:38 a.m. Eastern time. Soon afterward, NASA officials allowed the astronauts to return to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nichevo,'' or nothing, one Russian astronaut was heard saying in NASA's live online broadcast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it did not notice the debris until Friday, too little time to put more distance between the station and the trajectory of the debris. While NASA expected the debris to pass by safely, the six astronauts -- Anton Shkaplerov, Anatoly Ivanishin and Oleg Kononenko of Russia; Donald R. Pettit and Daniel C. Burbank of the United States; and Andre Kuipers of the Netherlands -- were ordered into the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it could not determine the size of the debris. Even small amounts of debris, however, can pose a danger to the 450-ton space station; the space station and the satellite debris were traveling at speeds of 17,500 miles an hour, NASA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday's episode underscored a recent report by the National Research Council warning that the increasing amount of space debris is threatening to interfere with the space station and working satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit group warned that the growing amount of debris is threatening to make low-Earth orbit unusable because of the potential for collisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Space Surveillance Network is tracking more than 22,000 objects larger than 4 inches in size, NASA said, with about 1,000 being some form of spacecraft and the rest being classified as debris. Most of the debris floats within 1,250 miles, or low orbit, of the planet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A zebra spider spins no webs, but instead catches its prey by leaping onto it. But in space, a zebra spider would zip off in a straight line instead of a trajectory curved by gravity, missing its target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amr Mohamed, an 18-year-old student from Alexandria, Egypt, wondered if the spider could learn and adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they can catch their prey in microgravity, it's going to be evolutionary,'' Mr. Mohamed said, ''because it's going to be the first time in history that an animal changes and adapts its hunting way to the zero-gravity environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon he, and the rest of the world, will find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mohamed's idea is one of the two global winners of Space Lab, a competition run by <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s video site; Lenovo, the computer manufacturer; and Space Adventures, a space tourism company. Students ages 14 to 18 from around the world were invited to make videos pitching a science experiment to be conducted on the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two 16-year-olds from Troy, Mich., Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma, formed the other winning team, with an experiment that will look at whether a fungus-killing bacterium will become even more effective at killing fungus when it gets back from a trip that will make it temporarily weightless. Scientists already know that salmonella bacteria become more virulent in zero gravity, and the bacterium in their experiment, Bacillus subtilis, contains the same protein that caused that change in salmonella.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea, that having your experiment in the space station, is so surreal and so literally out of this world,'' said Ms. Chen shortly after the winners were announced on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the zebra spiders, Mr. Mohamed does not think they will figure out how to catch fruit flies in space. These spiders do not spin webs, but they do attach a silk lifeline to themselves before leaping; this will allow them to reel themselves in and try again and again to aim themselves at fruit flies sharing their space station habitat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both experiments are already being designed and constructed at BioServe Space Technologies, a research center run by the University of Colorado at Boulder, and are scheduled to fly to the space station on a cargo ship launched by the Japanese space agency. Sunita Williams, a NASA astronaut, is to perform the experiments, which will be broadcast online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their grand prize, Ms. Chen and Ms. Ma will go to Japan for the launching of their experiment. Mr. Mohamed chose the other option: He will go to Star City in Russia for a week of the same training that Russian astronauts undergo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN DIEGO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEARLY 36 years ago, our understanding of life was changed forever when scientists towing a remote vehicle through the depths photographed a cluster of clams on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean far beyond the reach of sunlight, where no life was supposed to be. The clams were nourished by geothermal ocean vents instead of energy from the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, scientists and explorers from around the world have quietly and patiently discovered a foreign universe full of life here on Earth. The latest foray was on Sunday, when the director James Cameron descended nearly seven miles into a trough known as the Challenger Deep, the planet's deepest known recess, off Guam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should honor this accomplishment and encourage continued exploration through a global effort by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to preserve the deep seas. The open ocean beyond regions of national jurisdiction covers roughly half of the planet's surface. We have no idea what strange life thrives in the blackness there at depths of two miles or more. That's the point. We know enough that we don't want to lose it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep-sea researchers live apart from the bright lights and billions of dollars devoted to space exploration. But these researchers, working in relative obscurity, nonetheless have documented rich and surprisingly diverse communities of organisms in the deep sea. These have been low-budget expeditions, mostly robotic, sponsored by a handful of countries with a little capital to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At ocean vents, hot gases emerge out of the ocean floor and support life that does not rely on photosynthesis and sunlight. In the 1980s, different life was discovered at cold methane seeps. These life forms use methane as their source of energy, not the sun or photosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the weirdness continues. Recently, my colleagues Lisa Levin and Greg Rouse of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography documented an ecosystem off Costa Rica that shows elements of both vent and seep life, where organisms that can tolerate extreme heat and extreme cold can rub elbows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin flew into space in the first manned space flight, more than a year after the bathyscaphe Trieste, a deep-sea submersible carrying Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, descended 35,797 feet into the Challenger Deep. They were the true mad men of the era: the Trieste could have been sent unmanned to this depth, but instead Mr. Walsh and Mr. Piccard accompanied it on its first attempt, not hitting the panic button even when a Plexiglas window cracked at about 29,000 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We thought back then that the era of deep sea and space exploration had begun. We were right about space. But it wasn't until four private expeditions were assembled recently that a return to the Challenger Deep was possible. Over the next 10 years, scientists hope to exploit the wonderful technology invented for these expeditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday Mr. Cameron, in a submarine of his own design, on an expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society, finally became the first human to return to the Challenger Deep in more than 52 years. We should continue this exploration. Much remains to be discovered. Indeed, as just one example, my colleagues hope to discover new creatures that produce novel molecules that, when tweaked and synthesized in the lab, will replenish our rapidly decreasing array of effective pharmaceuticals. Properly managed, noninvasive use of our oceans might keep us safe until we are smart enough to design drugs with just our brains and computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exploration of the ocean depths will happen just like the exploration of Mars. Robots will do most of the work, collect all the data, and if we are lucky and smart enough to occasionally take a pilot along, these expeditions will enrich the human condition more than we can imagine. Yes, exploration of the deep ocean will be just like the exploration of Mars -- with one huge exception. We already know we are going to find life in the deep ocean, and lots of it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LLANO DE CHAJNANTOR, Chile -- Trucks stall on the road to this plateau 16,597 feet up in the Atacama Desert, where scientists are installing one of the world's largest ground-based astronomical projects. Heads ache. Noses bleed. Dizziness overcomes the researchers toiling in the shadow of the Licancabur volcano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then there's what we call 'jelly legs,' '' said Diego Garcia-Appadoo, a Spanish astronomer studying galaxy formation. ''You feel shattered, as if you ran a marathon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the same conditions that make the Atacama, Earth's driest desert, so inhospitable make it beguiling for astronomy. In northern Chile, it is far from big cities, with little light pollution. Its arid climate prevents radio signals from being absorbed by water droplets. The altitude, as high as the Himalaya base camps for climbers preparing to scale Mount Everest, places astronomers closer to the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opened last October, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, known as ALMA, will have spread 66 radio antennas near the spine of the Andes by the time it is completed next year. Drawing more than $1 billion in funding mainly from the United States, European countries and Japan, ALMA will help the oxygen-deprived scientists flocking to this region to study the origins of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project also strengthens Chile's position in the vanguard of astronomy. Observatories are already scattered throughout the Atacama, including the Cerro Paranal Observatory, where scientists discovered in 2010 the largest star observed to date, and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, which was founded in 1961 and endured Chile's tumult of revolution and counterrevolution in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ALMA opens a new stage for astronomy in Chile, which is favored by international research organizations for the stability of its economy and legal system. Like other radio telescopes, ALMA does not detect optical light but radio waves, allowing researchers to study parts of the universe that are dark, like the clouds of cold gas from which stars are formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With ALMA, astronomers hope to see where the first galaxies were formed, and perhaps even detect solar systems with the conditions to support life, like water-bearing planets. But the scientists here express caution about their chances of finding life elsewhere in the universe, explaining that such definitive proof is likely to remain elusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We won't be able to see life, but perhaps signatures of life,'' said Thijs de Graauw, a Dutch astronomer who is ALMA's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, scientists believe ALMA will make transformational leaps possible in the understanding of the universe, enabling a hunt for so-called cold gas tracers, the ashes of exploded stars from a time about a few hundred million years after the Big Bang that astronomers call ''cosmic dawn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALMA's construction, said Jesus Mosterin, a prominent Spanish philosopher who writes about the frontier between science and philosophy, and who visited the observatory last year, is taking place at ''the only time in history that windows into the universe are being thrown wide open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chile is not the only country luring big investments in astronomical projects. South Africa and Australia are competing to host an even bigger radio telescope, the Square Kilometer Array, which would be fully operational by 2024. China has begun building its own large radio telescope in a craterlike setting in the southern province of Guizhou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the financial crisis in rich industrialized countries has raised concerns that funding for some ambitious astronomy projects could face constraints. In the United States, a Congressional panel last year proposed killing NASA's James Webb Space Telescope before a compromise spending plan saved the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be very sad for humankind if we were so spiritually decadent to forgo the pleasures of consciousness and of knowledge,'' said Mr. Mosterin, reflecting on the funding choices political leaders need to make. ''These things make human beings a very interesting animal indeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALMA's Operations Support Facility, an outpost built for the scientists here in the Atacama, offers a glimpse into the lengths to which people go for astronomical discoveries. From Chajnantor, where dust devils dance across the plain, and unusually extreme weather in recent months has included rains and sand storms, a dirt road runs to the facility past towering cactuses and herds of wild donkeys and vicunas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The facility, at an altitude of about 9,500 feet, houses about 500 researchers and other staff in shipping containers turned living quarters. In a system similar to that on offshore oil platforms, scientists have daily shifts lasting up to 12 hours for 8 days straight. Many toil through the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Quiet Zone,'' reads one sign in an area of containers for ALMA's so-called day sleepers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supervisors enforce other rules, ensuring a work environment almost as austere as the surrounding Mars-esque landscape. Alcohol is prohibited, and those found drinking after trips into San Pedro de Atacama, a town about 30 minutes away by car, must dry out at a security checkpoint before entering the futuristic complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the control room, where astronomers spend hours peering into screens displaying the array of antennas, some gallows humor prevails. ''We are well in the control room, the 17,'' reads one message scribbled on a piece of roofing and posted on the wall after fire alarms went off by accident at the facility in 2011, sealing those inside the control room until they broke a door to escape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The note riffs on the 2010 mine accident and subsequent rescue of 33 miners in the Chilean desert, during which the trapped men sent a note to the surface saying, ''We are well in the shelter, the 33.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments elsewhere in Chile occasionally raise eyebrows here, like antigovernment protests that have rocked remote regions of the country this year and spread in March to the nearby mining city of Calama. ''The protests are not directly a concern,'' said Mr. de Graauw, ALMA's director. ''They are part of a democratic process, not a revolution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it seems at times that the astronomers stationed here are as far removed from the world around them as the miners working beneath other parts of the Atacama. English predominates as the observatory's language, tying together scientists from dozens of countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sense of awe still accompanies the installation of each new antenna. Two giant German-manufactured transporters, each with 28 tires and engines equivalent to two Formula 1 racing vehicles, are used to transport the antennas. Called Otto and Lore, they look like massive mechanized centipedes making their way across the arid landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a quietness that comes to you at Chajnantor,'' said Lutz Stenvers, a German engineer who came here in 2008 to lead a team from <span class="companylink">General Dynamics</span> building the antennas. ''I can see why this place was chosen.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disasters are a regular part of rocket science, as demonstrated by the American experience with its Vanguard program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That slim rocket was meant to launch the nation's first satellite into orbit. But starting in August 1957, four static firings of its engines failed. Pressure soared as Moscow successfully sent its first satellite into orbit that October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporters descended on Cape Canaveral, Fla. On Dec. 6, the countdown reached zero, and Vanguard lifted off the launching pad. It rose four feet before settling back in a churning ball of smoke and fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vanguard satellite fell clear and ''came comfortably to rest nearby, chirping innocently,'' according to ''The Heavens and the Earth,'' a history of the early days of the American space program. Early the following year, the United States was able to launch a satellite with a different rocket, and less than three months later, finally managed a successful Vanguard launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the United States can learn from failure, maybe North Korea can, too. It needs to, after 14 years of failures in the development of rockets powerful enough to loft a satellite -- particularly when its secretive leadership encourages its impoverished people to indulge in grandiose expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews, aerospace experts said major setbacks are a normal part of rocket programs and can produce crucial information for engineers struggling to identify problems and make improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This stuff is really hard to do,'' David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wright noted that South Korea had twice recently failed to fire a satellite into orbit, first on Aug. 25, 2009, and then again on June 10, 2010. ''It's basically a very hard business,'' he observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, North Korea's failures have some experts scratching their heads. They note that Iran -- which has drawn on North Korean expertise to build its own families of small and large rockets -- is in many respects outdoing its instructor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tehran fired its first satellite into space in 2009, joining the elite club of nations that have used their own technologies to send objects into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wright suggested that North Korea might be having problems with quality control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their overall design seems to make sense,'' he said. ''But mundane sorts of things might get in the way, such as welding. Putting it all together can be hard.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG - It's still 5 minutes to midnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Korean missile failure on Friday has not moved back the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock[http://www.thebulletin.org/content/media-center/announcements/2012/01/10/doomsday-clock-moves-1-minute-closer-to-midnight].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseen by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the clock tracks what the scientists call "the world's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons, climate change and emerging technologies in the life sciences."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the North Korean launching succeeded, had the North demonstrated that it now has a delivery vehicle that could ultimately carry a warhead, the clock might have ticked forward, especially because the regime is believed to have enough material for a half-dozen nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, on Jan. 10, the clock ticked ominously forward by a minute when the scientists became chagrined over "inadequate progress on nuclear weapons reduction and proliferation, and continuing inaction on climate change." (Decisions on the clock are made by the Bulletin's board of directors and its sponsors, including 18 Nobel laureates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clock may yet move forward again: Analysts expect North Korea to keep working on its own rockets, its own launching capabilities and its ongoing nuclear programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong-un, spoke to the public for the first time, addressing a mass rally and military parade in Pyongyang's main square to mark the centenary of the birth of his late grandfather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists," said Mr. Kim, quoted by The Associated Press. (His appearance was notable in that his father, Kim Jong-il, almost never made public speeches, perhaps because of a thin speaking voice. You can see and hear the new leader delivering his speech here[http://youtu.be/9wYA2WnlV64]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Jong-Un also praised his country's military as "capable of both offense and defense in any type of modern warfare." news.yahoo.com/nkorean-leader [http://t.co/ZrvnceKZ]</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As my colleague William Broad writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/14/world/asia/for-north-korea-failure-as-learning-opportunity.html], the experts view setbacks as part of the natural learning curve in all aerospace programs. It is, after all, rocket science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This stuff is really hard to do," said David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that South Korea has failed twice since 2009 to send a satellite into orbit. The United States is still having problems of its own: A $424 million NASA satellite called Glory crashed into the Pacific Ocean last year when its launching rocket failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the first few years of the space age, both the United States and Soviet Union had about a 50 percent success rate of getting their rockets into orbit, and that was even after a lot of trials of suborbital missiles," said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, speaking about the failed launching [http://www.npr.org/2012/04/13/150586639/a-silver-lining-when-rockets-fail-in-the-clouds]in an interview with NPR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classic foul-up often cited by aerospace historians, Dr. McDowell said, was one that doomed an early Venus probe when "a simple dash omitted in the guidance equation made it fly the wrong way, so it ended up at the bottom of the Atlantic instead of deep space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certainly," he said, "what you want to end up with is to be able to tell your boss that the mistake that lost your $100 million rocket was one that you could not have foreseen, not a units error like the one that the Mars probe, you know, crashed into Mars because they were using English units on one side of the fence and metric units on the other.[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/100199sci-nasa-mars.html]"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perseverance by North Korean rocketeers could well be on the agenda for the next meeting of the setters of the Doomsday Clock, perhaps along with the test-firing of a ballistic missile by Israel in November[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-test-fires-ballistic-missile-in-central-israel-1.393306], a move  that could be tempered by the agreement on Saturday[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/world/europe/iran-begins-nuclear-talks-with-six-nations.html] by Iran and six world powers to hold new talks on May 23 about Tehran's disputed nuclear program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least Iran remains a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. North Korea has withdrawn from the pact, while Israel, India and Pakistan have refused to sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pyongyang insists, meanwhile, that it has the right to develop a peaceful space program and that its missiles are being developed to put communications and weather satellites into orbit. On this latest attempt, the North provided a launch window, an orbital path and likely splashdown zones for two jettisoned rocket stages. For the first time it invited members of the international news media to Pyongyang, and it openly acknowledged that the launching had failed - another first .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not known whether another space-capable nation - China, Russia, the United States, France - has offered to launch North Korea's satellites for it. That way, the North could stop developing its own long-range rockets and missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From an economics and reliability standpoint, it would almost certainly make sense for North Korea to buy launch services from other countries[http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/preview-the-north-korean-launch] rather than develop its own space launcher," Dr. Wright said last week on the Bulletin's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The North's insistence on developing its own booster rockets is one reason that observers tend to see Pyongyang's space program as a cover for a ballistic missile program. But the same economic and reliability arguments could presumably be made for the South Korean space program, so the argument may not be so simple."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid, sacrifices had to be made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, on Wednesday morning, three vintage warplanes were trussed up and hoisted over the port side of the ship for a barge ride up the Hudson River to a museum near Schenectady, N.Y. They had to go to make way for the new star attraction: Enterprise, the prototype for the space shuttles that is due to arrive in New York City next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise, which the federal government awarded last year to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan, is not scheduled to reach the ship for several weeks, but its move began commanding attention on Tuesday when the shuttle Discovery rode on top of a 747 jet from Florida to Dulles International Airport outside Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery will displace Enterprise at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum near Dulles on Thursday. After posing Enterprise nose to nose with Discovery, a crew employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will lift the prototype onto the same, specially equipped 747 over the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the jet will ferry Enterprise to Kennedy International Airport on Monday morning, slowing along the way for a low-altitude tour of the Statue of Liberty and other New York landmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so for the first time, a space shuttle will land in the city. That is, if the weather cooperates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the sunbathed deck of Intrepid on Wednesday, much of the talk was about the forecast for untimely rain on Monday. ''We've had a month of great weather,'' said Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the museum president, as she apprehensively scanned the sky. If Monday is too inclement, NASA officials may decide to postpone Enterprise's final flight, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she spoke, workers guided a Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight, its black wings folded up to reveal the stars and stripes on their undersides, down to the pier below. The Skyknight, which did most of its fighting in the dark in the 1950s, took its place beside two foreign planes that were also being jettisoned: a British Royal Navy fighter-bomber known as a Supermarine Scimitar F1 and a Soviet-designed Mikoyan-Gurevich MIG-15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, the crane would move them onto an adjacent barge that resembled a floating Dumpster for the trip north to the Empire State Aerosciences Museum in Glenville, N.Y. Ms. Marenoff-Zausner said the decision to give up the planes was ''bittersweet'' because it would help Intrepid accommodate Enterprise, which the museum's directors hope will be a big draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With Enterprise coming, we had to make deck space,'' said Eric Boehm, the museum's curator of aviation and aircraft restoration. ''And the only way to make deck space was to move three airplanes off. It's hard to see them go, but it's for the greater good. We're going to get Enterprise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum will need to attract a big crowd to help offset the costs of transporting the shuttle from Dulles. The bill for the move, which the museum had to pay in advance, came to $9.6 million, said Matt Woods, the museum's senior vice president for facilities and engineering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Woods's staff must erect an all-weather tent, 56 feet tall, on the aft of the flight deck. They have begun reinforcing the steel deck to hold the Enterprise, which Mr. Woods says weighs about 75 tons. Already, a red outline of the shuttle's distinctive shape is painted there, the nose aimed at the commuter ferry terminal in Weehawken on the New Jersey side of the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get Enterprise there from the airport in Queens will be a trial of its own. First, the cranes and stabilizers being used at Dulles to take Discovery off the 747 and put Enterprise on it must be dismantled and trucked to Kennedy. In the meantime, Enterprise will remain mated to the jet in a tent at the airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, it will take about six weeks to get the shuttle off the plane and onto a barge. After a slow tug through Jamaica Bay, under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, through New York Harbor and up the Hudson to Pier 86, a floating crane with a 190-foot boom will hoist Enterprise onto the flight deck, Mr. Woods said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the shuttle is in place, Mr. Woods said, the tent -- similar to the bubbles that cover some tennis courts -- will be raised over it. By July, he said, the museum hopes to start selling tickets for entry into an exhibit designed around Enterprise that will cost about $3 million to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the serious fund-raising will begin. Later this year, Ms. Marenoff-Zausner said, Intrepid will start collecting donations toward a permanent structure, possibly a museum across the West Side Highway from the carrier with Enterprise as its centerpiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ultimately,'' she said, ''we want to be able to create a permanent home for it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countdown clock for the arrival of New York City's first space shuttle will have to be reset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration postponed their plans to transport the shuttle prototype Enterprise to Kennedy International Airport on Monday morning because of a forecast of incompatible weather conditions. A NASA spokesman, Michael Curie, said the agency would aim for the next day, when better conditions are expected. Clear skies will also make it easier for the public to witness its arrival in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise, which has been on display for several years at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's satellite site in Virginia, is ultimately bound for the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan. On Thursday, the Smithsonian conducted a changing of the shuttles, rolling Enterprise out to make room for Discovery, which repeatedly carried astronauts into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday morning, Enterprise was sitting atop the specially equipped 747 jet that will carry it to Kennedy. Mr. Curie said NASA hoped to complete the mission next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the president of the Intrepid museum, said safety concerns trumped the high level of anticipation for the shuttle's arrival. ''Enterprise will be here soon, and we know New York is excited for that moment,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After it arrives at Kennedy, Enterprise will stay there until June, when it will be loaded on a barge and floated to the Intrepid. In the Hudson River, a crane will lift it onto the flight deck of the retired aircraft carrier, which serves as the museum's home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it will be a platinum rush that finally opens up the final frontier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a new company called <span class="companylink">Planetary Resources Inc</span>. will unveil its plans to mine asteroids that zip close by Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], both to provide supplies for future interplanetary travelers and to bring back precious metals like platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture may sound far-fetched — perhaps along the lines of Newt Gingrich’s campaign promise to colonize the moon[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/moon/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — but it has already attracted some big-name investors, including Larry Page[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/larry_page/index.html?inline=nyt-per] and Eric Schmidt of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, as well as profitable technology development contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you believe that resources in space are critical towards a space-faring future, you will inevitably come to the result that the asteroids — in fact, the near-Earth asteroids — are the steppingstones to the rest of the solar system,” Eric C. Anderson, one of the company’s co-founders, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was quick to add that the company’s business premise was not as impractical as it might sound. Because an asteroid is devoid of air and its gravitational pull is negligible, getting there is relatively easy. Unlike landing on the moon or Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a robotic mining spacecraft would not need parachutes or a large engine to fly up to and attach itself to a small asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are probably about 1,500 near-Earth asteroids that are energetically easier to reach than the surface of the moon,” Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the asteroids are icy — up to 20 percent water — and the water could be drawn out by melting the ice. The water could be taken to supply stopovers for&nbsp;future astronauts or broken down into breathable oxygen or propellant for spacecraft on interplanetary missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other asteroids are rocky and metallic. A throng of robotic mining spacecraft could grind up pieces of the asteroid and smelt it to capture precious metals within.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Platinum — which is used for jewelry, electronics components and automobile catalytic converters — fetches about $1,500 an ounce these days, so a single spacecraft would not have to bring back a lot of it for the enterprise to make money. More common metals like iron could perhaps be used as raw materials in space factories, churning out spacecraft and other structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson and Peter H. Diamandis, the other founder of Planetary Resources, are already in the space tourism business with a company called Space Adventures, which has arranged eight trips to the International Space Station. While that venture has been a “reasonably good success story,” Mr. Diamandis said, “the realization, at least for us, was it wasn’t on track to really drive humanity opening the space frontier at the level that we desire.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three years ago, Mr. Diamandis recalled, he and Mr. Anderson asked the question, “So what’s next?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They set up Planetary Resources a couple of years ago, but have kept quiet about it until now. The president and chief engineer is Christopher A. Lewicki, who previously worked as a manager on Mars missions at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Based in Bellevue, Wash., the company employs about 25 engineers and has development contracts for technologies like laser communications that it believes it will need for prospecting and mining missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The company is cash flow positive, already,” Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the leaders of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, investors include Ross Perot Jr., chairman of Perot Systems; and Charles Simonyi, a former chief software architect for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and one of the space tourists who has visited the space station. Thomas D. Jones, a former NASA shuttle astronaut and James Cameron, the filmmaker and deep-sea explorer[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/science/earth/james-camerons-rocket-plunge-to-the-planets-deepest-recess.html], are advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson declined to say exactly how much money the company has raised. “It’s plenty,” Mr. Anderson said. “The collective net worth of our investors is like $50 billion, and they know what they’re getting into.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to launch the first spacecraft — a small telescope to find small nearby asteroids — within the next two years. Next, the company would send out a batch of small explorers to visit some of them. Actual mining would begin after that, first targeting water and then platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From meteorites that have landed on Earth, scientists know that some asteroids have concentrations of platinum 20 times that of ore in a platinum mine on Earth. But the concentration of the platinum would still be tiny — perhaps a few hundred atoms per million — and the company would need to develop robotic technology to extract the element from the rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To do large, large-scale mining of asteroids, you’re talking about decades,” Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility the company is considering is to nudge a small asteroid, perhaps one as long as a football field, into an orbit around Earth closer than the moon. Then Planetary Resources — and possibly other companies — could try out their ideas of how to set up a mining operation. “As one of the many options of how we could start the resource development, that’s certainly among them,” said Mr. Lewicki, the company president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing on nearby asteroids for natural resources is actually a very old idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1926, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a Russian scientist who worked out many of the basic requirements of rockets and space travel, listed colonization of the asteroid belt as number 12 of 16 steps in his “plan of space exploration.” Other dreamers have come along more recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is actually the fifth or sixth company that has been invented for purpose of doing it,” said John S. Lewis, a retired University of Arizona professor who wrote a 1997 book, “Mining the Sky” (Basic Books), that described much of what Planetary Resources is looking to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Rocket Company in the mid-1980s developed a rocket motor, but Dr. Lewis said George A. Koopman[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/21/obituaries/george-koopman-dies-in-wreck-technologist-for-space-was-44.html], one of that company’s founders, told him the ultimate destination was the riches of the asteroids. When American went out of business in 1995, James Benson, one of its founders, started another company, SpaceDev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, Mr. Benson made promises similar to the ones Planetary Resources has. SpaceDev’s Near Earth Asteroid Prospector was to rendezvous with an asteroid, conduct scientific observations and claim it as private property. It was never built. (While SpaceDev never got to orbit, the company, now part of <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corp</span>., did have a notable space achievement. Its motors powered the SpaceshipOne, the first privately financed manned flights to space and will also be used in Richard Branson’s upcoming Virgin Galactic spacecraft.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lewis thinks that Planetary Resources has a better shot at getting to the asteroids — he was involved with both American and SpaceDev and is also an adviser to Planetary Resources — because unlike previous ventures, “this one has the distinct advantage in that it has technical savvy and adequate capitalization to get started.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, a space shuttle landed in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not under its own power, though, because it never had any power of its own. The shuttle that arrived at Kennedy International Airport on Friday after swanning over the metropolitan area for about an hour was the Enterprise, which was the prototype for the shuttles that rocketed into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise rode on top of a 747 jet that took off from Dulles International Airport near Washington at 9:39 a.m. Less than an hour later, the paired aircraft glided over the harbor, past the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River as thousands of New Yorkers and tourists cheered and snapped pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gleaming in the sunlight, they circled the suburbs and made another pass by Manhattan, escorted by a T-38 Talon jet, before touching down at Kennedy Airport at 11:22 a.m. "American aviation," one man marveled as he joined dozens of other amateur photographers trying to capture the moment from the end of Pier 84 on the West Side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the flight was the first for Enterprise in more than 25 years, the shuttle's next move might be trickier. Enterprise is ultimately bound for the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, which is housed on a retired aircraft carrier docked at Pier 86.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> awarded the prototype to the Intrepid last year after ending the shuttle program and giving the three remaining orbiters to other museums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's so sad," said Sabrina Hawkins, 27, a chemical engineer who watched the flyover with her friend, Charles Mason. "It's nice they're giving it final respects, but we don't have a follow-on program."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly a decade, Enterprise had been on display at a satellite location of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. The Smithsonian preferred to have a shuttle that flew in space, so NASA gave it the shuttle Discovery, making Enterprise available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though officials in Texas, Ohio and Washington protested that their states were more deserving of such a valuable artifact of the space program, Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of NASA, said he wanted the shuttles to go where they would get maximum exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at a ceremony to welcome the arrival of Enterprise, New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, summarized the situation. "We won," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the officials of the Intrepid museum are scrambling to validate that decision. Unlike some other museums that had vied for shuttles, the Intrepid did not have a place to put one. Last week, workers cleared some room on the carrier's flight deck to accommodate the temporary shelter they plan to erect for the Enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That inflated structure, similar to the domes that enclose some tennis courts, is expected to cost about $3 million, on top of more than $9 million that the museum has to pay NASA for delivering Enterprise to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intrepid officials hope to recoup some of that money by selling tickets to the exhibition to see Enterprise up close. First, though, they must get the shuttle onto the ship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle is lifted - or demated, to use NASA's terminology - off the 747, it will stay at the airport until June 6, when museum officials plan to place it on a barge and tug it through Jamaica Bay and up the Hudson. A floating crane will then lift the shuttle onto the Intrepid's flight deck. It will sit there, with its black nose pointed toward New Jersey, for a few years while museum officials work on their ambitious plan to build an annex on land that would serve as the shuttle's permanent home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will be fortunate if city residents and visitors remain as eager to catch a glimpse of the Enterprise as those gathered along the West Side were on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the aircraft soared over the Statue of Liberty, affording the crowds in Battery Park a clear profile, one spectator from Brooklyn, Peter Vasiljev, turned master of ceremonies, announcing, "Ladies and gentlemen, it's the shuttle Enterprise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the High Line park along the West Side, the various languages - French, Italian and others - heard before the plane came into view all melted into the universal reactions of "ooh" and "aah" as Enterprise flew by. After it passed from view, Julian Wu, a 67-year-old resident of Chelsea and self-proclaimed space nut, said wistfully, "I expected to hear a sonic boom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, with duties calling, the gatherings dispersed. Torrey Taralli, 33, who works in digital marketing, packed his camera and began to make his way off the elevated High Line park to 18th Street. "I've got to go," he said. "Got to get back to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several miles away at Kennedy, the controller guiding the flight onto the runway said to the NASA pilots, "Welcome to New York, and thanks for the show."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colin Moynihan and Christopher Reeve contributed reporting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth-observing systems operated by the United States have entered a steep decline, imperiling the nation's monitoring of weather, natural disasters and climate change, a report[https://download.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13405] from the National Research Council warned on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-running and new missions are frequently delayed, lost or cancelled because of budget cuts, launch failures, disorganization and changes in mission design and scope, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the research council, the working arm of the National Academies, issued a report[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11820] highlighting research imperatives for the next decade and beyond for NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Geological Survey, including the renewal of the Earth observations program. (The report issued on Wednesday was commissioned by NASA as a midterm assessment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although NASA responded favorably to the 2007 report, the committee said, the observational program's budget has fallen short and changes in the program's scope, overseen by the Office of Management and Budget and by Congress, have impeded progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis Hartmann, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington and the chairman of the committee that produced the new report, suggested that it could serve as a sobering reality check. "It's likely our capabilities will decline fairly precipitously at just the time they're most needed," he said. "If nothing is changed, we're predicting to be down to 25 percent of our current capabilities by 2020."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hartmann described the factors contributing to the decline in observational capacity as a "near-perfect storm" of problems. For starters, he said, there is the ongoing federal budget crisis. Most of the equipment that the nation currently maintains in space, he adds, is aging and will inevitably fail, but no replacements are in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we want to have a continuous measurement of the Earth as a system to see if any changes are occurring, then we need to sustain these systems as our economy improves," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hartmann also cited a severe shortage of medium-size launchers, the equipment that shoots data-gathering satellites into space. Initiatives dating back to the Clinton and Bush administrations sucked up billions of dollars without producing many results, he added, referring to a proposed system that was supposed to combine the best elements of the nation's defense and civilian weather satellites but came to naught.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question comes down to what priority should be given to observing the Earth. For both scientists and laypeople, the arguments for embracing a high level of commitment are many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surface winds are measured from space to predict and map hurricanes. Instruments for detecting movements in the Earth's crust help understand and track earthquakes. Sea-level fluctuations are monitored, severe weather warnings are issued and long-term weather forecasts are prepared with the help of satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather satellites also pick up emergency beacons used by those who venture into remote areas and become stranded, leading to the rescue of nearly 300 people in 2010 alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not least, space monitoring allows researchers to keep an eye on climate change and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, helping to inform scientific understanding of the processes that drive global warming and estimate how big the changes will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost everything you can imagine about how Earth as a system works," from natural hazards to planning involving water and air quality, "is measured or monitored from space," Dr. Hartmann said. "A lot of factors important for the commerce and quality of life are measured from space effectively and efficiently -- and those will go away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all was a loss, however, the report said. NASA did follow through with several of the mission launches outlined in the 2007 survey, and the agency tried to make up for budget shortfalls by aggressively pursuing international partnerships. But that may not suffice, and NASA's Earth science budget will not sustain pressing national needs, the researchers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Dr. Hartmann and his colleagues found that NOAA's satellite Earth observation program and its next generation of polar environmental satellites - integral parts of NASA's program - are suffering from budget shortfalls and cost overruns that block progress.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOJAVE, Calif. -- The sign into town, slightly weathered, says ''Gateway to Space!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond it lies the Mojave Air and Space Port, once a Marine auxiliary air station during World War II, now an incubator for the tinkerers and dreamers in the New Space movement. Adherents believe that the next phase of space exploration will be led by nimble, ambitious entrepreneurs -- a new generation of people like Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who helped create the electronics industry in a garage -- and that this is their moment to come together and make it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very similar to the Silicon Valley effect,'' said Stuart O. Witt, the chief executive of the space port for the past decade, explaining how half a dozen outer space start-ups came to cluster at Mojave, a small desert town about 90 miles north of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where the first private, piloted spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, launched in 2004. Virgin Galactic is now conducting flight tests of a larger version, called SpaceShipTwo, that will take tourists on jaunts 62 miles up, giving them a brief bout of weightlessness. Small start-ups here are also developing new rocket fuels and trying to transform a discarded second stage of a rocket into a prototype moon lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the headline event for this push of entrepreneurs will take place on the other side of the country, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., where the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, plans to launch cargo (but no people) to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, all spacecraft going to and from the station have been government-operated vehicles like NASA's space shuttles and Russian Soyuz capsules. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Dragon capsule, perched atop its Falcon 9 rocket, will be the first purely commercial supply ship -- albeit one paid for by NASA -- to make the trip. The launching, delayed several times, is now scheduled for May 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The melange of small aerospace companies at Mojave shows that the ambitions of the New Space movement go far beyond serving as a delivery service for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the companies are fronted by famous billionaires: Virgin Galactic is part of Richard Branson's empire, while Stratolaunch is the brainchild of Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. Stratolaunch is building two cavernous structures, a factory to build an airplane with the widest wingspan and a hangar to store it in. The airplane will be an airborne launching pad for a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the lesser-known start-ups with shallower pockets and grungier work spaces. Masten Space Systems is housed in a one-floor box dating to Mojave's World War II days. The workshop is essentially a large garage, with pieces of rockets sitting on the concrete floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masten's specialty is its software, which makes a rocket take off vertically, hover and then land softly on the launching pad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Masten, the founder, used to dabble in rockets while running a technology company in the Bay Area. After the company was sold to Cisco, he founded his rocket company and, three years ago, won $1 million in a NASA-sponsored competition to demonstrate precision flying similar to what would be needed for a future lunar lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a hobby anymore,'' said Joel Scotkin, Masten's chief executive. ''We're essentially self-sufficient in terms of revenue right now as we grow our business and customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture has attracted people like Nathan O'Konek. A lawyer by training, he was working in New York putting together finance deals and volunteering at the Intrepid Air and Space Museum to sate his fascination with space. On a visit to Mojave, he learned about Masten and chucked it all to move here, becoming the director of business operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just 15 or so employees -- the number changes with the flow of interns -- Mr. O'Konek is often out at the launching pad helping load liquid oxygen into a rocket. Masten engineers fly their reusable rockets and conduct engine tests several times a week. ''You're out there all the time,'' Mr. O'Konek said. ''I like what we're doing. It's exciting, but I also like to see the other companies out there pushing the envelope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even smaller is Firestar Technologies, which gets much of its money from federal research contracts. Its main product is an alternative fuel for the thrusters that spacecraft use to maneuver in space. The chemical currently used, hydrazine, is highly toxic, and Greg Mungas, Firestar's chief executive, has a less toxic kind that could be tested soon on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mungas started Firestar while at the University of Colorado, Boulder, but in 2009 he moved the company to Mojave, where it fit in more easily, adding to the cacophony of sonic booms, explosions and rocket launches that are heard daily. ''There are very few experiments that you can't basically design and run'' in Mojave, he said. ''It's a very, very open environment for doing this kind of testing. It's great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mojave is also the home of Scaled Composites, started by Burt Rutan, an aerospace pioneer. It was he who designed the first plane to fly around the world without refueling: Voyager, which completed that trip in nine days in 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air and space port is in an area replete with aerospace history. Just to the south is Edwards Air Force Base, where the Voyager flight began and ended, and where many of the Air Force's early rocket planes flew, including Chuck Yeager's X-1, the first to break the sound barrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Rutan's company continued to thrive after the 1986 flight, the rest of Mojave languished. By the mid-1990s, the port was best known as a parking lot for mothballed jets that airlines could not afford to fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern history of Mojave as a space capital starts with a business failure: the Rotary Rocket Company. The founders of Rotary wanted to shake up the industry with a low-cost design that merged rocket propulsion with helicopter blades in a vehicle that could get all the way to orbit. A prototype of the vehicle, called the Roton, was built and got off the ground with three test hover flights -- but then the company ran out of money and went out of business in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Roton now sits in a small park at the port, a testament to the airfield's philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We actually take pride in giving people permission to fail,'' said Mr. Witt, the port's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rotary people did not go away, but instead founded new space companies. Jeff Greason, Rotary's propulsion chief, opened <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>, also at Mojave. The company is building a space plane called Lynx that, like SpaceShipTwo, is meant to take tourists on suborbital flights. The Lynx is smaller, with just two seats: one for the pilot, the other for the passenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">XCOR has almost run out of money a couple of times -- employees have gone without paychecks occasionally -- but says it is flush with cash right now because of an infusion of investments. Test flights of the Lynx could begin this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like everyone at the Mojave port, Mr. Greason is looking forward to the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> capsule launching, viewing it as just the latest step along the road. ''They have much to be proud of,'' he said of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, run by Elon Musk, an Internet entrepreneur. ''But I don't believe they have reached the point where they are independent of NASA for their continued research and development activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that matter, neither have most of the start-ups here. While they cheer on Mr. Musk's rocket, they hope the momentum they are building is larger than that flight's fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's ridiculous to condition the success or failure of the industry on any one launch,'' Mr. Greason said, but ''there is reason for optimism that in the next few years, one or more companies -- I certainly hope we're one of them -- will become profitable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 9, 2012, Wednesday</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmed: Vesta, the second largest of the asteroids, is a runt planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observations by NASA's Dawn spacecraft show that Vesta formed within the first few million years of the solar system, that its surface is in places as bright as snow and in others as dark as coal, and that it contains an iron core that may have even briefly generated a magnetic field -- all very planetlike features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Vesta and Ceres, the largest asteroid and the Dawn's next destination, are also heavy enough that gravity has made them round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Dawn team finds itself calling these things planets all the time,'' Christopher T. Russell, the mission's principal investigator, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current parlance of astronomers, however, Vesta and Ceres, like Pluto, are dwarf planets, not planets. The definition of planet, set by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, not only takes into account size and appearance, but also requires that a planet be the gravitational bully in its orbit. While Vesta and Ceres are round, they have not vacuumed up or pushed away thousands of other rocks in similar orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is in large part what makes Vesta intriguing. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter seems to be the remnants of a planet that never came together, and a closer look at Vesta could reveal much about the planet-building process. Dust coalesced into larger chunks like Vesta, which is 330 miles wide, and these then combined to form the rocky planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, what scientists have learned from the Dawn fits with what they thought. ''Science doesn't have to go back to the drawing board right now,'' Dr. Russell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists report their Vesta findings in six articles in Friday's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the surprises is that two giant craters near the south pole of Vesta formed relatively recently: one of them a billion years ago, the other at least two billion years ago. On other solar system bodies like the Moon, such giant impacts occurred very early in the history of the solar system, about four billion years ago. The mineralogical measurements also confirm that a class of meteorites that have been found on Earth came from Vesta, very likely ejected by the impact that created the giant craters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vesta's pockmarked surface could also help tell why the pieces of the asteroid belt never became a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Vesta formed, the gravity of newly formed Jupiter stopped further growth. The traditional view is that Jupiter's pull accelerated the Vesta-size asteroids so that they smashed themselves apart instead of gently coming together. Jupiter would have scattered away many of the original asteroids, but slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alternate idea, however, is that Jupiter, nudged by leftover gas and dust in the early solar system, migrated inward to where Mars orbits today, scattering away the asteroids, and later was pulled outward again by the gravity of Saturn, and in its wake pulled back some asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vesta is definitely super interesting for the work that we did,'' said Kelvin Walsh, a research scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., whose computer simulations indicated that this could explain the current asteroid belt and why Mars is small compared with Earth and Venus. He is not a member of the Dawn team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2,000 craters on Vesta cataloged by the Dawn scientists could tell the history of impacts, and if Dr. Walsh is right, there might be fewer than would be predicted by the traditional picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dawn spacecraft has been orbiting Vesta since last July. This August, it will propel itself away from Vesta and head toward Ceres, which is slightly farther out from the Sun, but of a much different makeup. While Vesta is all dense rock and metal, Ceres appears to contain large amounts of ice. That could help solve another open question of the solar system: Where did Earth's water come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might have come from Ceres-like bodies that formed farther out in the solar system and then were pulled in by a migrating Jupiter, Dr. Walsh said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF you wanted to find a good place in Manhattan from which to plan a manned mission to Mars, the studio of the artist Tom Sachs might not be the first place you would look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a stretch of Centre Street at the edge of SoHo that has achieved the antique polish of so many fashionable downtown blocks, the storefront studio stands out as a holdover from the neighborhood’s pre-money past. The main entrance is barricaded by a rusted metal cage and gate, behind which there is a beaten-up buzzer and a hand-scrawled sign that says, unhelpfully, “Brancusi.” If you didn’t know an artist and his assistants worked there, you could easily mistake the interior — encrusted with power tools and cubbyholes and bad fluorescent light fixtures — for a wholesale hardware supplier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a recent visit Mr. Sachs and his studio manager attempted to show off a scale model of the Saturn rocket that launched a generation of men to the Moon. But just as a demonstration was about to get under way to create a smoky, realistic-looking liftoff on a small video screen, power to the model went kaput. A space heater wired up in an old Winnebago parked out front had tripped a circuit breaker in the studio. “That’s crazy,” Mr. Sachs said, staring ahead in disappointment. “We’ve got to get it on a dedicated circuit. That should not happen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again the trip to Mars he has been planning obsessively for several years is not really the kind where an equipment failure would spell catastrophe, unless you concur with the artist Bruce Nauman’s dictum that art is a matter of life and death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Mars mission will go only as far up as the Upper East Side. The air its astronauts breathe will be of a late springtime New York City composition. The landing module from which they emerge will be made mostly from three-quarter-inch plywood and screws. And the surface their motorized rover explores will consist not of rocky red soil but of the flat century-old pine boards that form the immense drill floor of the Park Avenue Armory at East 66th Street, where for a month beginning Wednesday Mr. Sachs will become the latest artist to take on the daunting space. Since the Armory’s transformation in 2006 into one of the largest contemporary-art exhibition spaces in the country, artists have approached the drill floor’s 55,000 square feet with widely varied modes of assault. It has been draped with Lycra tulle (Ernesto Neto), “painted” with the aid of peeling-out motorcycles (Aaron Young), filled with 30 tons of discarded clothing (Christian Boltanski) and turned into an oddly didactic Renaissance painting classroom by the director Peter Greenaway, whose installation looked lost in the setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs will likewise use the floor to display all manner of objects, some quite realistic — the rover, the lander (a life-size model of the real Apollo lunar lander), a mission control center, a mobile quarantine unit (the aforementioned 1972 Winnebago) — and many others that would never make a NASA manifest but that sound like pretty good things to pack for a very long interplanetary trip, like a hot-nuts machine, an old-school JVC boombox outfitted with solar panels and a beer fridge shaped like Darth Vader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his larger intention is to transform the drill hall into a theater for an extended piece of performance art, one that mines the United States space program for an entire prefabricated aesthetic — script, choreography, costumes, sets — and also for a complex load of cultural baggage about what fuels the compulsion to explore outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs, 45, has long had a reputation in the art world as a kind of high-comic tinkerer and provocateur who remakes industrial and consumer objects in an abject wood-shop fashion, as if to reclaim the mass-produced world for humanity or at least reopen humanity’s eyes to the things that increasingly make up its visual landscape. He has carried this objective to sometimes sensationalistic lengths. In 1999 the dealer Mary Boone was arrested after a Sachs show featuring handmade shotguns and an Alvar Aalto vase full of real bullets for people to take home. At the Jewish Museum in 2002 he exhibited a scale model of a German concentration camp made from a Prada hatbox, an equation of fashion and fascism whose “irony, if that’s what it was,” Michael Kimmelman wrote in The New York Times, was lost on the Holocaust survivors who wrote him in angry disbelief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs’s DIY aesthetic has always straddled the line between art and science project, and the critical knock on him has often been that he labors perhaps a little too much to satisfy his own material fetishes. With “Space Program: Mars”[http://www.armoryonpark.org/index.php/programs_events/detail/tom_sachs_space_program/] the risk is that the project will be seen less as an art installation than as a monumental space-nerd amusement park, a view that Mr. Sachs said would greatly underestimate his ambitions. “I always feel that people really misunderstand my vision, especially when it comes to NASA,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His fascination with the space program goes back many years — he staged a mission to the Moon[http://vimeo.com/34679521] at Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles in 2007 — but it did not grow out of boyhood astronaut fantasies. It grew instead out of his conviction that the Apollo program, one of the crowning technological achievements of the 20th century, was in itself mostly a work of performance art, one that spoke volumes about America’s aspirations and fears. Relative to their immense cost the Moon shots produced little of practical value, their real goal being cold-war cultural and political spectacle, which placed them, Mr. Sachs said, firmly in the realm “of the useless and spiritual, just like art.”He saw it all as a perfect kind of ready-made. And like many artists of his post-post-Duchampian generation he set out to remake it in his own style, not casually but by adopting all the discipline and can-do spirit that President John F. Kennedy summoned in his famous 1962 Moon speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m a complete perfectionist, as you can see, in my own filthy way,” said Mr. Sachs one morning in early spring in his studio, where many members of his 15-member crew were hard at work on elements of the Mars mission, which has been commissioned by the armory and the public art organization Creative Time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like to say that unlike the military, where you have to build something to such an exacting degree that it works every time and doesn’t kill someone, we have to build it so that it will work at least once,” he said. “But that’s still very hard to do, and we’re very serious about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He even sought the advice of real space scientists, befriending engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena, Calif., two of whom came to New York to visit his studio in 2010 and have acted as unofficial advisers ever since. “It was going to be just a lunch meeting,” said Adam Steltzner, one of the engineers, “and it actually ended at 3:30 or 4 in the morning the next day. It was kind of unbelievable. It was a very high-level interaction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steltzner, who is in the midst of his own Mars mission[http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/] — he oversees entry, descent and landing for the $2.5 billion NASA project that will try to deposit the Curiosity rover on the planet in August — said the chemistry in the studio was partly personal (there is rarely a dull moment around Mr. Sachs) but also a result of the engineers’ appreciation of the degree to which artists can engage in intellectual, conceptual play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We actually experience some small, short periods of that in our work here,” he said in a phone interview. “But that’s maybe four hours in three years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, after Mr. Sachs appealed to the engineers for badly needed help transforming an E-Z-Go golf cart into a working, realistic-looking Mars rover (complete with a joystick to replace the terrestrial-looking steering wheel), the project ended up being heavy on the play: in Mr. Sachs’s telling, “a really fun night of drinking and welding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If scientists yearn for the freedom of artists, however, Mr. Sachs’s studio operates as a place where artists — or at least the artist in chief — yearn for the rigors of science. Upon entering, every visitor is photographed with a large handmade camera fashioned mostly from plywood and issued an official-looking identification sticker. The walls are covered with labels and handwritten lists. And anyone doubting the importance of these lists is directed to an instructional video called “Ten Bullets,”[http://tenbullets.com/] which Mr. Sachs and a former assistant, Van Neistat, made in 2010 to explain the studio’s philosophy. Among the precepts: “Creativity is the enemy;” “Inventions and developments must happen within the existing vocabulary — don’t jump ahead; stick to what has been defined for you to do”; “Proper knowledge of the code is the first step in working to code”; and “Follow this guide carefully and you probably won’t be fired.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs said he made the video mostly so he wouldn’t have to explain the basics to new interns. But while its management-seminar deadpan is extremely funny, the message is utterly serious, and the video has taken on a strange life of its own as a training tool. (A <span class="companylink">Young &amp; Rubicam</span> executive recently praised the video on his blog as “impactful.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video and code are knit deeply into the entire project. And over the course of the exhibition the public — or “civilian witnesses” — will get to see a fair amount of the results of the studio’s “Right Stuff” training and preparation. The more adventurous will even get to participate, earning rewards, like a visit to the landing module, by helping out with menial mission tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the majority of the performance involved in the project has happened over the last few months for the benefit of no one, really, except Mr. Sachs and his crew, as if the exhibition is only a kind of public observance of much more extensive rites for a new secular religion. Every Friday morning, for example, in a borrowed room at the armory, they change into white shorts, white running shoes and white T-shirts with the maxim “It will not fail because of me” written on the back and do an hour of vigorous calisthenics and stretches, a routine the young studio assistants seem to embrace with mostly nonironic gusto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s almost like a cult,” said Anne Pasternak, Creative Time’s president and a curator of the show. “It’s not just about making objects. It’s about involvement in an ongoing performance every minute of the day. And he’s using that to ask a lot of very serious questions about human ideologies and the decisions we make about this planet and the future of our species.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course it is also highly entertaining for the self-appointed flight director of an intricately constructed fantasy world almost entirely of his own design, in which everyone suits up and plays along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting one morning in the rover, parked surreally in an old oak-paneled storage room at the armory awaiting its mission, Mr. Sachs said, “There’s a very fine line between having great knowledge of all these scientific and technological and industrial cultures and actually becoming a part of them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether he still knows the location of that line may be an open question. “We’re really going to Mars,” he said with a smile radiating Chuck Yeager confidence. “I mean, we’re doing it here at the armory, but except for the setting, we’re really going.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like a routine event for NASA: At 4:55 a.m. on Saturday, a rocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and carry cargo -- but no people -- to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if all goes as planned, that morning will mark something transformative for the space industry: a victory for capitalism in what has been for decades a government-run enterprise. The capsule, built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short -- would be the first commercial spacecraft to make it to the space station, and many observers view its launching as the starting gun in an entrepreneurial race to turn space travel into a profit-making business in which NASA is not necessarily the biggest customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, there are some hints of how the era of commercial space travel might unfold. Companies like Virgin Galactic, XCOR and Space Adventures are booking passengers on suborbital joy rides to space, promised for dates within the next few years, and hundreds of people are signing up. And already there are celebrity tie-ins: Among the people who have signed up for Virgin's first flights are Ashton Kutcher, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Katy Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more mundane note, the launching of commercial satellites has been a steady business for decades, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is among the companies already competing for contracts. Indeed, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> already seems to have built a viable business here, having announced more than $1 billion of contracts in the last few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the longer-term dreams, which may sound less far-fetched as each landmark in space travel grows nearer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think humanity needs to get to Mars, one way or another,'' said Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, who vows that his company will send people to Mars in as little as 10 years -- more likely 15 years, and certainly within 20. He said he would do this with or without NASA: ''I would prefer it would be with NASA. If not, we have to find another path.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station is only a couple of hundred miles up -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s rocket has yet to get there, of course -- and Mars is millions of miles away. But Mr. Musk predicts that travel to Mars will eventually become commonplace, and that the ticket price will eventually -- perhaps a decade after the first flight -- drop to half a million dollars. That contrasts with the more than $60 million a seat that the Russians are currently charging NASA to take one astronaut to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is it possible to achieve that?'' Mr. Musk said in an interview at his headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. ''I think it is. My calculations show that it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, space travel has been expensive and, as a government-managed operation, has had little incentive to streamline. NASA, of course, was the only game in town for American astronauts, and most recently it operated the shuttles that supplied the International Space Station. Big aerospace has been involved, too: One company, <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture between <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, effectively has a monopoly for launching satellites for NASA and the Air Force on its Delta IV and Atlas V rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only recently have smaller, nimbler companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, some of them run by billionaires who proved themselves in other fields, started trying to compete as equals with NASA and its major contractors. (Mr. Musk, for example, is an Internet entrepreneur who founded <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is attempting to build the same class of vehicle, to my mind, only with modern manufacturing techniques and management techniques to reduce the cost,'' said Jeff Greason, chief executive of XCOR Aerospace, which is building a two-seat rocket plane to take tourists to the edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the end of the space shuttle program, NASA has relied on Russia to take its astronauts to space in Soyuz rockets, but now it is looking to hire commercial companies for space taxi services. So there are incentives for commercial companies both to build the transportation and to offer it at competitive prices. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for one, says that it could provide rides to NASA astronauts at $20 million a seat, a third of the Russian price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new space companies are relying on taxpayer dollars to finance their research and development. The Obama administration requested $830 million for next year to finance the development of passenger-carrying spacecraft. Proponents argue that the investments will jump-start a vibrant new business that dwarfs NASA; Congress has so far remained skeptical. A report by the House committee in charge of NASA's budget said the program ran the ''risk of repeating the government's experience from last year's bankruptcy of the solar energy firm <span class="companylink">Solyndra</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the ambivalence on Capitol Hill, the new space competition has drawn both entrepreneurs and the old aerospace giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, better known as ATK, manufactured the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttles and had the contract to build a longer-range version as the first stage for NASA's next-generation rocket, the Ares I. That was before the Ares I was canceled in favor of the space taxi approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK has now teamed up with Astrium, a European rocket company, to come up with what is essentially a commercial version of the Ares I, which it called the Liberty. Last week, ATK announced that it was developing its own capsule -- based heavily on the Orion capsule that was originally going to sit on top of the Ares I -- to carry astronauts for NASA one day. ATK says it, too, would charge less than the Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is not clear is whether there are people and companies interested in buying all those seats to orbit. Currently, the market for taking people into space is small. NASA needs to send only two crews a year to the space station, and if a piece of space debris were to disable the station, there would suddenly be no demand at all. The commercial future of space, while relying on NASA financing in the short run, needs new markets for manufacturers to take advantage of the economies of mass production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only way to make a dramatic reduction of price is to assume a dramatic increase of launches,'' said Mr. Greason of XCOR. ''You have to assume there is some market, that there will be enough demand to support that low price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current rockets -- most of them good for one launching only -- are very expensive regardless of whether they are built by entrepreneurs or government. The future of low-cost travel in space hinges on reusable rockets and technologies not yet developed, space experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk declined to talk about what a profitable business model for sending people to Mars might look like, but said his ultimate goal of a $500,000 trip to Mars depended on a large number of passengers and fully reusable systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not going to try to convince people I can do it,'' he said. ''I'm just going to do it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its space shuttle in retirement, NASA is now preparing to land humans on Mars. The other Mars, that is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To set foot on a more down-to-earth model, all anyone needs is a slight suspension of disbelief. On arrival, Tom Sachs will be waiting — by the espresso machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sculptor best known for his duct tape, foamcore and construction-barrier reproductions of Modernist furniture and buildings, guns, Hello Kitty dolls and even Nazi death camps, Sachs is now leading visitors to the Park Avenue Armory around his own private Red Planet. Temporarily ensconced within the armory’s vast Wade Thompson Drill Hall, it has a beer cooler, a hot peanuts dispensary and the aforementioned espresso machine, all stripped of polish and ready to rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Definitely bring the kids. “Space Program: Mars[http://tomsachsmars.com/],” a collaboration between Sachs, Creative Time and the armory, is an inner-space playground for the whole family. It’s also a serious artwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sachs, 44, has been developing his own space program since at least 2006, when his full-scale, plywood Lunar Landing Module set down at the Gagosian Gallery[http://www.gagosian.com/shop/tom-sachs-13] in Los Angeles. The same structure, newly outfitted with a functioning bar, toilet, “fecal stimulant” and command center, now sits on a launch pad at the center of the space, surrounded by red plywood berms that stand in for the Mars terrain, lit by a “sun” of bright lights mounted on a large, tripod-supported disc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under “Colonel” Sachs’s command, a crew of 20 highly trained technicians carries out its exploration and survival mission with a precision that would be the envy of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Their tasks include ritualized routines that involve dispensing food (the aforementioned foil-wrapped hot peanuts), collecting scientific samples, testing rockets, running a daily exercise regimen, churning out a hand-stitched ‘zine documenting the mission every week and exploring the space in a working replica of a NASA rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors who want to do more than just look around must first undergo “indoctrination” in Sachs’s dictatorial work ethic before they can join the team and enter the capsule. That means performing menial tasks (sweeping floors, sorting nails), watching a series of instructional films in a screening room and stamping brown paper bags for popcorn with the mission logo. Also on view is that part of the American psyche that subscribes to Manifest Destiny, where no frontier is out of reach of the imagination — ground zero for an artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sachs, whose code name for the moment is Tango Sierra, science is the only true religion and “Space Program: Mars” is his D.I.Y. temple to it, and the culmination of all of his work since his first show in New York, in 1995, when he introduced the products he branded as “Cultural Prosthetics” — guns made of discarded hardware and cut-up Con Ed barriers, monochromatic duct-tape paintings and Hello Kitty icons, and taped foamcore Knoll furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the armory, his ultimate goal is to answer the age-old cosmic question “Are we alone?” Because his show is really about life on Earth, the answer is a conclusive no. “Exploring other planets,” he said at a preview on Tuesday, “is a way of studying Earth and understanding how precious life is right here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also how fun. Personally, I had a great time exploring this Mars. First, I watched an utterly realistic demonstration of a rocket launch displayed on the bank of monitors that make up Sachs’s Mission Control center. Later I discovered the rocket was actually a foot-long, handmade model contained within a tool cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going to another planet, Sachs had said, also means considering how we interact with it, especially when we try to colonize it. That usually means bringing the comforts of home to it. To that end, the Sachs studio has imported the culture of the handmade object, something increasingly precious in a society that worships packaging and branding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One import is a domed, tatami-matted teahouse made of Sachs’s signature Con Ed barriers. On a separate platform, friendly crew members, all dressed in white pants, ties and shirts with Mars mission pocket protectors, roasted tasty peanuts under the heat of a clamp light, and then sent them down a conveyor belt for collection in a bathtub wheelbarrow. Others dispensed ice-cold vodka and beer from a black refrigerator as tall as Darth Vader and topped with the character’s helmet. Another station was a galley kitchen serving rice and beans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What looked like a pinball machine was in fact the “rescue” station, where a crew member manipulated a plastic yellow helicopter that picked up a space capsule that had just splashed down at sea and moved it to a model aircraft carrier. Beside it, in a Winnebago where astronauts suited up in a quarantined area, was a red phone on which successful astronauts could talk to the president — Nixon, in this case, who delivers an actual speech (written by William Safire) that was prepared in case real-life astronauts were stranded on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best part of this experience was going into the air-conditioned landing module and examining (though not trying) the toilet and looking through the library, where there were copies of “Ulysses,” “Origin of the Species,” “Remembrance of Things Past” and other bibles of Sachs’s religion. Though it weighs 22,000 pounds, it takes only four casters of compressed air to lift it a few inches off the floor, which will happen at the end of the “mission.” All I know is that I was so comfortable up there, I didn’t want to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “Space Program: Mars” isn’t all fun and games. The basic idea is to demonstrate how much labor is actually involved in mundane activities, and that there is life in every product, even if it’s Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may strike some as sheer folly, a waste of time and foamcore. But all inventions seem like the outpourings of the mad, whether they work or not. Sachs is fetishizing the whole process and doing what sculptors always do — mold objects that change our perception of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there’s more to come. When the show closes, Sachs and his team of specialists will embark on a new mission: to Europa, Jupiter’s moon. Speaking into a microphone that carried his voice over the program’s P.A. system, Sachs said, “Tango Sierra in ascent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sachs’s “Space Program: Mars[http://tomsachsmars.com/]” continues through June 17 at the Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, New York. The crew performs demonstrations for the public every Thursday from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, how quickly does grape juice turn to wine?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two California high school students hope to find out soon. Their experiment is one of 15[http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-1-to-iss/] aboard a rocket scheduled to blast off early Saturday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., to the International Space Station. “We think it’s going to ferment faster,” said Max Holden, a ninth grader at Chaminade College Preparatory in West Hills, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no guarantee that the seven-inch tube of yeast and grape juice will ever reach its destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching is a test flight of a spacecraft built by the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation[http://www.spacex.com/], or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif. The event is slightly historic: if all goes well, the ship will be the first operated by a private company, rather than the government, to supply the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erring on the side of caution, officials at NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> have stressed that the purpose of the mission is to shake out glitches. “I think there’s a significant chance the mission does not succeed,” said Elon Musk[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/science/16elon.html], chief executive of SpaceX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, a Falcon 9 rocket with a Dragon capsule on top of it, will carry more than 1,000 pounds of cargo, mostly food and clothing — items that NASA regards as no big loss should the launching fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only scientific experiments on the mission are those devised by students as part of a program run by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education[http://www.ncesse.org/]. They will explore the effects of zero gravity, including whether medicines can slow bone loss and whether certain bacteria that eat plastic would thrive and eat greater amounts of plastic in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liftoff, set for 4:55 Saturday morning, is timed to take place at the moment the launching pad lines up with the space station’s orbit. If weather or a technical problem keeps the rocket on the ground, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will have to wait until 3:44 a.m. Tuesday for the pad and orbit to line up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reaching orbit, the Dragon capsule is to perform a series of test maneuvers. On the third day, it is scheduled to fly 1.5 miles under the space station to demonstrate its navigation and communication systems. If it passes the tests, NASA will give the go-ahead for the final approach on Tuesday, when Donald R. Pettit, a NASA astronaut, will use the space station’s robotic arm to grab the Dragon and pull it to a docking port.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If successful, the Dragon would be the first commercial spacecraft to visit the space station, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would collect the remaining payments on a $396 million agreement with NASA to develop the cargo ship. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would then enter a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo flights to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the flight fails, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would have to repeat the demonstration flight until it succeeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has so far avoided the early failures that typically accompany a new rocket like the Falcon 9. The maiden flight, in June 2010[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/science/space/05rocket.html], was almost flawless. The second flight[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/science/space/09rocket.html] — the first under the NASA agreement — was in December 2010, putting into orbit a Dragon capsule that successfully parachuted back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successes have, however, taken longer than anticipated. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> originally predicted its first visit to the space station would be in 2009. The delays were not a big surprise, Mr. Musk said, given the complexities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certainly, we would have hoped to have been further ahead,” he said, “but I wouldn’t have expected that with great confidence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the students at Chaminade Preparatory looking forward to the winemaking experiment, the launching will be particularly exciting. If the capsule makes it to the space station, one of the astronauts there will mix the grape juice and yeast and let it ferment for five days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Max Holden and his lab partner, Paige D’Andrea, a 10th grader, will perform the same experiment, and when the space wine is returned to Earth about a month later, they will compare the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we get it back, we’re going to get one of the priests to bless it,” said Nancy McIntyre, the director of the project for Chaminade, a Catholic school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To figure out which one is more alcoholic, the students will not taste any of the fermented grape juice, but instead will measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced by the yeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 23, 2012, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the items being carried to the International Space Station in a privately built spacecraft misstated the number of student experiments that the cargo includes. There are 15 student experiments aboard the flight, not 11.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The launching of a privately owned cargo rocket heading to the International Space Station was aborted at the last second on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket's nine engines had ignited, but computers detected a high pressure in the chamber of the center engine and shut them down The rocket is held down during the final engine checks and never left the launching pad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket and its cargo capsule, both built by the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., represent an important step in NASA's evolution to rely more heavily on commercial companies for its human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the capsule, the Dragon, reaches the space station, it will be first commercial spacecraft to dock there. All previous vehicles, like NASA's space shuttles and Russia's Soyuz capsules, were government operated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the evening, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> officials said they had identified a faulty valve as the problem and said the next launching attempt would be on Tuesday at 3:44 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight will be a second test in a $396 million program by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to develop the cargo ship. If successful, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will then enter a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo flights to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> flight is carrying 1,000 pounds of nonessential cargo, mostly food and clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA signed the development agreement with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> in 2006 as part of an effort to encourage new commercial space ventures and to reduce launching costs for the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second company with a NASA cargo contract, the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., hopes to get its first test flight off the ground in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency now also wants to turn to commercial companies for the launching of its astronauts. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hopes an upgraded Dragon will capture at least some of that business. After the retirement of the space shuttles last year, NASA astronauts currently must ride on Russian Soyuz rockets to get into space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When three American astronomers won the Nobel Prize in Physics last year[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/], for discovering that the expansion of the universe was speeding up in defiance of cosmic gravity — as if change fell out of your pockets onto the ceiling — it reaffirmed dark energy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_energy_astronomy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], the glibly named culprit behind this behavior, as the great cosmic surprise and mystery of our time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it underscored the case, long urged by American astronomers, for a NASA mission to measure dark energy[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/science/03dark.html] — to determine, for example, whether the cosmos would expand forever or whether, perhaps, there might be something wrong with our understanding of gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2019, a spacecraft known as Euclid will begin such a mission to study dark energy. But it is being launched by the European Space Agency, not NASA, with American astronomers serving only as very junior partners, contributing $20 million and some infrared sensors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some scientists, this represents an ingenious solution, allowing American astronomers access to the kind of data they will not be able to obtain on their own until NASA can mount its own, more ambitious mission in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for others, it is a setback. It means that for at least the next decade, Americans will be relegated to a minor role in following up on their own discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While it’s great to support other missions,” said Adam Riess[http://www.stsci.edu/~ariess/] of Johns Hopkins and the Space Telescope Science Institute[http://www.stsci.edu/portal/], who shared that Nobel last year, “it would be disappointing to see the U.S. lose or outsource its own leading role in one of the hottest areas of research.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Riess and his colleagues, this turn of events is another example of a worrying trend in which American scientists, facing budget deficits and political gridlock, have had to pull back from or delay promising projects while teams based in Europe hunt down the long-sought Higgs boson[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/higgs_boson/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or rocket scientists in China plan a Moon landing in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Turner[http://astro.uchicago.edu/people/michael-s-turner.shtml], a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, called dark energy “an example of how the U.S. seems to misplay its science hand these days.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We predicted and discovered dark energy,” he said. “We have the biggest dark-energy community and the best ground game; we have been designing a space mission since 1998; and now the Europeans will fly it with our minor participation. Something is wrong with this picture.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saul Perlmutter[http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/faculty/perlmutter.html], of the University of California, Berkeley, another of the dark energy Nobel winners, said, “The danger, of course, is that we will watch the science (and scientists — and good students) move on to other countries and continents, where projects are being begun and completed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With them, scientists say, could go the cultural excitement and innovative spark that invigorates the economy. The World Wide Web, for example, was invented at CERN[http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/about/web-en.html], the <span class="companylink">European Organization for Nuclear Research</span> (home to the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider[http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html]), to help particle physicists communicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the United States’ flagship lab for high-energy physics, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab[http://www.fnal.gov/], had to close down its accelerator. the Tevatron, last fall, and learned from the Energy Department in March that the agency could not afford to follow through for now on a $1.3 billion underground experiment to study the spooky shape-shifting properties of particles known as neutrinos in an effort to investigate why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the department also canceled money for studies for the world’s next big physics machine, the International Linear Collider[http://www.linearcollider.org/], which would be the successor to CERN’s giant collider. American scientists are resigned to the likelihood that it will not be built in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American physicists are now rethinking how to carry out the neutrino experiment, which was to have been the centerpiece of a plan to convert the old 8,000-foot-deep Homestake gold mine in Lead, S.D., into a national laboratory for underground science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar facilities in Italy, Canada and Japan have become centers in the search for dark matter[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_matter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], neutrino experiments and other delicate work that requires shelter from cosmic rays. But in 2010, the National Science Foundation[http://www.nsf.gov/] walked away from the $875 million project, citing unease about safety and “stewardship” of the old mine, which is half full of water. Meanwhile with support from a philanthropist, T. Denny Sanford[http://www.sanfordconsortium.org/about-t-denny-sanford.htm], the State of South Dakota has reopened parts of the mine for a pair of physics experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is no achievement of modern American science — from the Manhattan Project to the Hubble Space Telescope[http://hubblesite.org/] to the decoding of the human genome — that does not owe a debt to hard and even heroic bargaining in the formerly smoke-filled rooms of Congress and the White House. Complaints and grim prognostications about the federal research budget are part of the background music of science. The situation is always fluid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given all that, other scientists say that basic research is doing as well as can be expected given severe budgetary restraints. Among other things, NASA’s Webb telescope, the successor to the Hubble, is on target for launching in 2018, at a cost of $8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science office in the Energy Department actually got an increase in the budget released by President Obama in February, but the money went to more applied research, into areas like energy and scientific computing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only last month, Congress added money to the neutrino experiment, although not enough to get the whole project back on track, said Katie Yurkewicz, Fermilab’s spokeswoman, and the <span class="companylink">Association of American Universities</span> issued a statement applauding appropriators “for their bipartisan actions thus far to sustain the nation’s investment in scientific research.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Elmegreen[http://faculty.vassar.edu/elmegree/Site/Welcome.html], a professor of astronomy at Vassar and president of the American Astronomical Society[http://aas.org/], has spent a lot of time in Washington lately. “Congress seems supportive of science,” she said. “I’m encouraged that people recognize the need for science and technology to continue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: “U.S. leadership is at risk in practically every area. We’ll get by for now, but we can’t be complacent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, all bets could be off if the automated budget cuts, called “sequestration,” decreed by the failure of the deficit reduction negotiations[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/us/politics/lawmakers-concede-budget-talks-are-close-to-failure.html?pagewanted=all] last summer, go into effect in January. A certain amount of gloom has reached the most prestigious levels of American science. Writing in a recent issue of The New York Review of Books, Steven Weinberg[http://www.ph.utexas.edu/&amp;], a Nobel laureate at the University of Texas in Austin, decried the fact that science[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/may/10/crisis-big-science/] was increasingly having to compete with other worthy causes, like health care and education, for money. The solution, he said, was to raise taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Wilczek[http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/wilczek_frank.html], a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, described himself as “less gloomy” than Dr. Weinberg, but nonetheless concerned that, with the end of the cold war and bad economic times, the traditional political bases of government support for basic research had dwindled, leaving only “curiosity and desire to participate, even indirectly, in doing something great.” He added, “We should be doing that anyway, of course.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is all a great pity, because tremendous scientific opportunities are available,” Dr. Wilczek said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States gave up its leadership in high-energy particle physics 20 years ago, when Congress canceled the Superconducting Super Collider, a particle accelerator that was under construction in Texas. That move cleared the way for CERN’s eventual supremacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the same thing happen in space? Those fears were aroused two years ago when NASA announced that the James Webb Space Telescope project needed $1.6 billion more and several years to complete. It was canceled by the <span class="companylink">House Appropriations Committee</span> last summer but later restored. The price of that rescue, however, was to delay NASA’s dark energy mission, and to withdraw from a couple of upcoming joint Mars missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travails of the dark energy researchers provide a window into the labyrinthine process by which big projects live or die. Whether you find the story hopeful or depressing depends on who you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark energy is, according to Dr. Wilczek, “the most mysterious fact in all of physical science, the fact with the greatest potential to rock the foundations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery that the expansion of the cosmos was speeding up came from observing exploding stars known as Type 1A supernovas[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/universe/supernova1a_nf_01.html], luminous and uniform enough to serve as distance markers. Realizing that only a telescope in space could find and measure supernovas distant enough to shed light, so to speak, on the genesis of this behavior, Dr. Perlmutter early on urged the construction of a special space probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, after a decade of wrangling among astronomers and NASA and the Energy Department, a blue-ribbon panel from the National Academy of Sciences charged with determining astronomical priorities endorsed a version of this idea as the highest-priority space science mission for the coming decade. The billion-dollar mission, called Wfirst, for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope[http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/], would search for exoplanets as well as measure the effects of dark energy on the history and evolution of the universe. The academy’s deliberations were ambushed, however, by the subsequent announcement of the Webb telescope’s problems, which have pushed the Webb launch all the way to 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lia LaPiana, a program executive at NASA, said that, from 2013 to 2018, there is “zero money” in the president’s budget for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a down payment on an eventual mission, NASA suggested spending about $200 million for a 20 percent stake in Euclid, the European Space Agency’s mission. The academy rejected that idea, saying that Euclid, which would not measure supernovas at all, did not meet the academy’s requirements and could undermine the possibility of an eventual Wfirst project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however, a specially convened committee of the academy has given the nod to a $20 million investment in Euclid in the form of equipment, saying it would give American astronomers a seat on the Euclid science team and access to its data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What changed in the last year? David Spergel[http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/], an astrophysicist at Princeton, who was chairman of the committee, said, “For 20 percent, we were offered a modest participation. For 2 percent, we were offered a modest participation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Schechter of M.I.T., co-chairman of a team planning Wfirst, said he had endorsed the deal on the grounds that it would not impinge on the Wfirst project. When the president’s budget was released, however, there was $9 million for Euclid and no money for beginning the Wfirst project. The budget is only the first step in this dance, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Dr. Schechter told a House appropriations subcommittee that the budget did not represent the “strong U.S. commitment” to Wfirst that the academy had recommended. He asked for $8 million to get things going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House panel agreed and responded in its report by directing NASA to explain how its plans were consistent with the academy’s recommendations. In the meantime, the corresponding Senate appropriations subcommittee has put $10 million for the NASA dark energy mission into its proposed budget report, citing last year’s physics Nobelists by name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more dance moves to make in this year’s budget and the rest of the decade before the Wfirst mission can become a reality, but Dr. Schechter said he felt encouraged. “I suspect Wfirst wasn’t very high on anyone’s list of priorities,” he said, referring to turmoil at NASA last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “I think that is changing.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — He does not have the name recognition of some other space entrepreneurs, people like Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin empire, or Paul Allen of <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> fame, or Jeff Bezos, the <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> billionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will probably change if things keep going his way. Elon Musk[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/elon_musk/index.html?inline=nyt-per], a computer prodigy and serial entrepreneur whose ambitions include solving the world’s energy needs and colonizing the solar system, was the man of the hour — or of 3:44 a.m. Tuesday, Eastern time — when the rocket ship built by his company, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, lifted off gracefully in a nighttime launching and arced off in a streak of light amid loud applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Falcon flew perfectly!!” Mr. Musk posted exultantly on Twitter from his iPhone at 4:04 a.m. “Dragon in orbit, comm locked and solar arrays active!! Feels like a giant weight just came off my back :)”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, his unmanned Dragon capsule, lifted into orbit by his Falcon 9 rocket, will berth at the International Space Station on Friday bearing a modest cargo: 162 meal packets (45 of them low-sodium), a laptop computer, a change of clothes for the station astronauts and 15 student experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far more important than the supplies is the proof of concept. Mr. Musk is trying to show the world that a determined entrepreneur can start a rocket company from scratch and, a decade later, end up doing a job that has until now been the exclusive province of federal governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every launch into space is a thrilling event,” John P. Holdren, President Obama’s assistant for science and technology, said in a statement. “But this one is especially exciting because it represents the potential of a new era in American spaceflight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest achievement by Mr. Musk, a cocky businessman who was born in South Africa and is one month shy of his 41st birthday. Best known for helping found <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and selling it to <span class="companylink">eBay</span> in 2002 for $1.5 billion, he currently multitasks by running two companies he founded: <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, officially known as the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, and <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, which in 2008 brought to market a head-turning all-electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster. He is also chairman of SolarCity, a company that designs and installs solar energy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/solar_energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is based in Hawthorne, Calif., a few miles from Los Angeles International Airport, and Tesla is in Palo Alto in Northern California, but Mr. Musk runs both hands-on. He shuttles up and down the state, spending a few days a week at each. Early Saturday morning, he was in <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>’s mission control for the first launching attempt of the Falcon 9 when the computers called a last-second abort, shutting down engines that had already ignited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, he was crowing about a victory for Tesla’s new all-electric sedan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Major Tesla milestone,” he wrote on Twitter on Monday. “All crash testing is complete for 5* (max) safety rating. Cars can now be built for sale to public!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Falcon 9 launched, putting Mr. Musk at the center of NASA’s ambitious effort to turn over basic transportation to low-Earth orbit to private companies. On the same day, Tesla put out a news release announcing that customer deliveries of its electric sedan, the Model S, would begin on June 22 — ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Model S “represents Tesla’s transition to a mass-production automaker and the most compelling car company of the 21st century,” Mr. Musk is quoted as saying, sparing no modesty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(His characteristic confidence was also on view on Sunday night, when he told his 38,000 followers on Twitter that the abort on Saturday was actually overcautious: “Simulations show launch ok with bad valve,” he wrote. “Still, better to stop &amp; fix. Recalling rockets after launch is not an option.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dragon is scheduled to stay at the station until the end of the month as astronauts unpack its cargo and replace it with items to bring back to Earth. Undocking on May 31, the Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off California. With the completion of a successful demonstration, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would begin a $1.6 billion contract to fly 12 cargo missions to the space station, and it hopes to be among the companies that NASA selects to take astronauts to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re really at the dawn of a new era of space exploration, and one where there’s a much bigger role for commercial companies,” Mr. Musk said at a news conference after the launching Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moment was also an inflection point in Mr. Musk’s own career. After leaving South Africa for Canada at 17, he wound up at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in economics and physics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Mr. Musk went on to a graduate program in applied physics and materials science at Stanford[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford]. He stayed two days before dropping out to start Zip2, a company that developed Web sites for media companies; he and his brother sold it to Compaq in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk then founded X.com[http://X.com], which provided financial services and payment by e-mail. X.com[http://X.com] merged with another company, Confinity, to form <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, and Mr. Musk built it into the primary means that <span class="companylink">eBay</span> bidders use to pay for their purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the sale of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, Mr. Musk looked for new things to do. By the standards of Internet tycoons, he was a pauper: after taxes, he had a fortune of about $170 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most Web entrepreneurs, however, he did not start more Internet companies. Instead he chose ventures involving complex technology and plowed almost all of his <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> fortune into them: $100 million into <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which he founded in 2002, $50 million into Tesla and $10 million into SolarCity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just four years ago, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> went through a near-death experience. The first three launchings of the company’s small Falcon 1 rocket failed. One more failure, Mr. Musk said, and he would have run out of money. As he went through a divorce from his first wife, with whom he has five sons, he had to borrow money from friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth launching succeeded. Late in 2008, NASA awarded <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> the cargo contract. The first two Falcon 9 launchings, in 2010, also succeeded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Tuesday morning, the success streak continued. As the countdown clock hit zero, the engines remained ignited. Less than 10 minutes later, the Dragon was in orbit. It then aced several other early tasks like the deployment of solar arrays and navigational sensors and the testing of GPS equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anything could have gone wrong,” Mr. Musk said. “And everything went right, fortunately.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A private cargo rocket bound for the International Space Station blasted off early Tuesday morning in what NASA hopes will mark an important step in handing routine space missions over to the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the brilliant glare of nine engines spewing out 1 million pounds of thrust, the rocket, a Falcon 9 built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX[http://www.spacex.com/], rose slowly off the launching pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station here, then arced upward into the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What a spectacular start,” the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., told reporters afterward. “It was a picture-perfect launch.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payload is only about 1,000 pounds of cargo, and nothing of great value. The importance is instead technical and symbolic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the cargo capsule makes it all the way to the space station, it would be the first commercial, rather than government-operated, spacecraft to dock at the space station. A successful mission would reinforce NASA’s efforts to turn over basic transportation to low-Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] orbit to private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re really at the dawn of a new era of space exploration and one where there’s a much bigger role for commercial companies,” Elon Musk[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/elon_musk/index.html?8qa], <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>’s chief executive, said during a news conference after the launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With success of this flight, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would begin a $1.6 billion contract to fly 12 cargo missions to the space station. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is also among the companies aiming to win NASA business for taking astronauts to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday’s launching was the third for the Falcon 9 rocket and it followed the same pattern of two earlier ones in 2010, in which a last-minute glitch halted the first attempt before the rocket went off without a hitch on the next try.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an aborted liftoff[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/science/space/spacex-rocket-launched-aborted.html?_r=1] on Saturday morning, the engines of the 157-foot tall Falcon 9 rocket had already ignited before computers shut them down because of high pressure in the combustion chamber of the center engine. By the end of the day, technicians had found a faulty valve and replaced it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its second attempt, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had to wait until Tuesday at 3:44 a.m. for the space station’s orbit to line up with the launching pad, enabling the capsule to be launched on a trajectory trailing the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time as the countdown clock hit zero, the engines remained ignited. Less than 10 minutes later, the cargo capsule, known as the Dragon[http://www.spacex.com/dragon.php], was in orbit. Several other early tasks were also successful including deployment of its solar arrays and navigational sensors and testing of the global positioning system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anything could have gone wrong, and everything went right, fortunately,” Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, confirmed that the second stage of the Falcon 9 contained a payload from Celestis of Houston that carried to orbit the ashes of 300 people, including the actor James Doohan, who played the chief engineer Scotty in the original “Star Trek” television series and Gordon Cooper, one of the original Mercury astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard part of the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> mission is still to come. It has to catch up to the space station, which circles the Earth at 17,000 miles per hour. On Thursday, it is to fly about 1.5 miles underneath the space station to demonstrate its communication and navigation systems. If it passes all of those tests, it will circle around and begin a final approach toward the space station until it is about 10 meters away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A robotic arm on the space station, operated by one of the astronauts aboard, will grab onto the Dragon and swing it to a docking port.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once there, the Dragon would remain attached to the station until the end of the month as astronauts unpack its cargo and pack in items to bring back to Earth. Undocking on May 31, the Dragon would land in the Pacific Ocean off California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> does not reach all of the goals on this flight, it may have to fly another demonstration flight before beginning the cargo contract.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday morning the cargo capsule built by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a private company, may (or may not) have docked with the International Space Station. After Tuesday's launch of the Falcon 9, the rocket carrying the capsule, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief executive, Elon Musk, said at a news conference, ''We're really at the dawn of a new era of space exploration and one where there's a much bigger role for commercial companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, another private company, one operated by the artist Tom Sachs, is gearing up for an imaginary manned expedition to Mars. Preparations for that voyage, including all the equipment Mr. Sachs and his team will need, are on display in ''Space Program: Mars,'' an exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory that is expansive and diverting but not as imaginative or conceptually provocative or as much fun it ought to be. It is produced and curated by the Armory and Creative Time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs is not a rocket scientist but a sculptor who creates rough copies of technologically complicated objects out of plywood, foam core, tape, glue, nuts and bolts and other materials -- including real objects like propane torches, hand tools, boomboxes and thermoses -- readily available from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and other vendors. A memorable example was a life-size airplane lavatory that he made in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most impressive piece here is the ''Landing Excursion Module,'' a version of the Apollo Lunar Module that carried astronauts to the surface of the Moon. Over 23 feet tall with antennas and dishes attached to its top, the boxy white structure stands on splayed, shock-absorbing steel legs with inverted-dome feet. Unlike the Apollo module, this one's body is made of plywood panels painted white and visibly held together by tape and glue. If you undergo the program's ''indoctrination'' -- see below -- you will be permitted to climb up a short aluminum ladder and into the cabin, which is also made of plywood. Here there is some exotic-looking equipment, like a bank of shiny yellow metal air bottles with connecting hoses, but it is not nearly as complex as you would expect a real extraterrestrial vehicle's interior to be. It is more like a fabulous backyard fort for kids built with basic parental construction skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distributed elsewhere about the Armory's 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall are a ''Mobile Quarantine Facility,'' which is a repurposed 1972 Winnebago Brave; a ''Mars Excursion Roving Vehicle,'' a bodiless, battery-powered car with all its parts exposed for exploring the Martian landscape; and ''Mission Control,'' where more than three-dozen computer screens display live feeds from cameras placed throughout the exhibition. Scattered about the floor as well are red, crystal-shaped mounds made of plywood, tape and glue, meant to suggest the surface of Mars. A red NASA logo appears on many objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entertainment factor is enhanced by an introductory lesson for those who choose to undergo it. First you must watch a series of amusing movies by Mr. Sachs in which basic, often nonsensical tenets and rules of his enterprise are explained in a deadpan delivery mimicking that of real training films. Next you go to the Indoctrination Center, where you are tested on what you have learned from the films. If you pass you will be permitted to enter the landing module and participate in the program as one of Mr. Sachs's crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show's entertainment is diminished, however, because the exhibits are mostly static. Few objects do more than sit there to be looked at, and observing the variously clunky, smart and dumb ways of representing high-tech equipment wears thin after a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it all means as art remains fuzzy. Nothing about the show convinces you that space exploration is a subject of great urgency. That is not to say that it cannot be. For much of the first half of the 20th century Mars was an object of considerable popular fascination largely because the possibility of intelligent life there had yet to be ruled out. More recently, however, as unmanned expeditions to that planet have revealed an insalubrious climate and barren landscape inhabited by microbes at best, Mars as a destination has faded from the collective imagination. Travel to other galaxies, sure, but Mars? Who wants to go there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs's project might be taken as Warholian social satire, a spoof of the modern corporate culture and its gung-ho work ethic, so at odds with artistic romanticism. That aspect is heightened in one of the Armory's smaller, separate rooms, where Mr. Sachs is selling space-camp-style sneakers, knapsacks and overcoats that he designed and that <span class="companylink">Nike</span> has issued in limited editions. (These are not cheap.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a critique of branding and commercialism animating his art, it seems equally likely that Mr. Sachs aspires to the kind of business model associated with Takashi Murakami, who has incorporated his own gift shop into his museum exhibitions to sell high-end handbags and cheap souvenirs. But Mr. Sachs has a way to go before he achieves such seamless vertical integration. And with the launch of Falcon 9, it appears he needs to do some catching up with events in real time and space too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tom Sachs: Space Program: Mars'' runs through June 17 at the Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 933-5812, tomsachsmars.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High above northwestern Australia, a robotic arm on the International Space Station grabbed onto a cargo capsule floating 10 meters away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that penultimate act, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, made history as the first private company to send a craft, the Dragon, to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grab -- which NASA refers to as a grapple -- occurred at 9:56 a.m. Eastern time on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks like we've got us a Dragon by the tail,'' said Donald R. Pettit, the NASA astronaut on the station who was operating the robotic arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andre Kuipers, an European Space Agency astronaut, then took over the robotic arm to pull the Dragon to a docking port on the station, locking it there just after noon. After the hatches are opened on Saturday, the astronauts aboard the station will spend six days unloading the cargo brought up by the Dragon and replacing it with items to take back to Earth. The Dragon is to undock on Thursday and parachute into the Pacific Ocean off California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launched the Dragon capsule on top of its Falcon 9 rocket on Tuesday. The company and NASA spent several days conducting tests to check the Dragon's operations. On Thursday, it flew 1.5 miles beneath the station to test its communication and navigation systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It passed those tests, then looped around the space station to begin its final approach. By design, the approach was slow, with built-in pauses. As part of the testing process, the crew sent commands to the capsule to stop or temporarily move away, ensuring that Dragon could be safely sent off if something went badly awry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> did run into some difficulties with Dragon's navigation sensors, one that took thermal images and one that bounced laser pulses, and that delayed the capture by a couple of hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is, I think, going to be recognized as a significantly historical step forward in space travel,'' <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief executive, Elon Musk, said during a news conference. ''Hopefully the first of many to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk's dreams are far grander than delivering cargo to the space station. Although he would like to carry astronauts to the station in a few years, that would still be merely retracing accomplishments that the American and Russian space programs achieved decades ago. ''It's evolutionary, not revolutionary,'' Mr. Musk agreed in an interview last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To accomplish Mr. Musk's very long-term goal -- sending people to Mars, which he regards as essential for ensuring the survival of humanity -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> must create new technologies that fundamentally change the current equation of space travel, in which most of the vehicle is thrown away each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk talks of reusable rockets, but his first attempt to accomplish that -- recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 via parachute -- failed. Twice, in 2010, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> tried this method, but each time the rocket stage disintegrated as it fell. On this flight, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> gave up trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new idea is for the engines to fire again after they drop off, and the rocket stages would fly back to land to be refueled. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> plans to begin tests of this vertical takeoff and landing concept, dubbed Grasshopper, this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk also talks of building a giant rocket powered by next-generation engines using new fuels, bigger than the Falcon Heavy rocket he is hoping to launch within the next two years. ''It's going to be very big,'' he said. ''Very huge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigger than the Saturn V that launched NASA astronauts to the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Could be,'' he said with a smile. He said he would provide more details later this year or in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has also consistently underestimated the time it would take to accomplish its tasks. In 2006, when NASA selected it to develop the cargo ship, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said the first trip to the station would take three years; it took six. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also has a large backlog of commercial satellites it is under contract to launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This track record may be relevant to Mr. Musk's stated goal: he said he thought <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> could send people to Mars in 15 years -- 20 years at most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that prediction, he said he hoped he was not off by a factor of two. ''I'll be 80,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its space shuttle in retirement, NASA is now preparing to land humans on Mars. The other Mars, that is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To set foot on a more down-to-earth model, all anyone needs is a slight suspension of disbelief. On arrival, Tom Sachs will be waiting - by the espresso machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sculptor best known for his duct tape, foamcore and construction-barrier reproductions of Modernist furniture and buildings, guns, Hello Kitty dolls and even Nazi death camps, Sachs is now leading visitors to the Park Avenue Armory around his own private Red Planet. Temporarily ensconced within the armory's vast Wade Thompson Drill Hall, it has a beer cooler, a hot peanuts dispensary and the aforementioned espresso machine, all stripped of polish and ready to rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Definitely bring the kids. ''Space Program: Mars,'' a collaboration between Sachs, Creative Time and the armory, is an inner-space playground for the whole family. It's also a serious artwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sachs, 44, has been developing his own space program since at least 2006, when his full-scale, plywood Lunar Landing Module set down at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles. The same structure, newly outfitted with a functioning bar, toilet, ''fecal stimulant'' and command center, now sits on a launch pad at the center of the space, surrounded by red plywood berms that stand in for the Mars terrain, lit by a ''sun'' of bright lights mounted on a large, tripod-supported disc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under ''Colonel'' Sachs's command, a crew of 20 highly trained technicians carries out its exploration and survival mission with a precision that would be the envy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Their tasks include ritualized routines that involve dispensing food (the aforementioned foil-wrapped hot peanuts), collecting scientific samples, testing rockets, running a daily exercise regimen, churning out a hand-stitched 'zine documenting the mission every week and exploring the space in a working replica of a NASA rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors who want to do more than just look around must first undergo ''indoctrination'' in Sachs's dictatorial work ethic before they can join the team and enter the capsule. That means performing menial tasks (sweeping floors, sorting nails), watching a series of instructional films in a screening room and stamping brown paper bags for popcorn with the mission logo. Also on view is that part of the American psyche that subscribes to Manifest Destiny, where no frontier is out of reach of the imagination - ground zero for an artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sachs, whose code name for the moment is Tango Sierra, science is the only true religion and ''Space Program: Mars'' is his D.I.Y. temple to it, and the culmination of all of his work since his first show in New York, in 1995, when he introduced the products he branded as ''Cultural Prosthetics'' - guns made of discarded hardware and cut-up Con Ed barriers, monochromatic duct-tape paintings and Hello Kitty icons, and taped foamcore Knoll furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the armory, his ultimate goal is to answer the age-old cosmic question ''Are we alone?'' Because his show is really about life on Earth, the answer is a conclusive no. ''Exploring other planets,'' he said at a preview on Tuesday, ''is a way of studying Earth and understanding how precious life is right here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also how fun. Personally, I had a great time exploring this Mars. First, I watched an utterly realistic demonstration of a rocket launch displayed on the bank of monitors that make up Sachs's Mission Control center. Later I discovered the rocket was actually a foot-long, handmade model contained within a tool cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going to another planet, Sachs had said, also means considering how we interact with it, especially when we try to colonize it. That usually means bringing the comforts of home to it. To that end, the Sachs studio has imported the culture of the handmade object, something increasingly precious in a society that worships packaging and branding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One import is a domed, tatami-matted teahouse made of Sachs's signature Con Ed barriers. On a separate platform, friendly crew members, all dressed in white pants, ties and shirts with Mars mission pocket protectors, roasted tasty peanuts under the heat of a clamp light, and then sent them down a conveyor belt for collection in a bathtub wheelbarrow. Others dispensed ice-cold vodka and beer from a black refrigerator as tall as Darth Vader and topped with the character's helmet. Another station was a galley kitchen serving rice and beans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What looked like a pinball machine was in fact the ''rescue'' station, where a crew member manipulated a plastic yellow helicopter that picked up a space capsule that had just splashed down at sea and moved it to a model aircraft carrier. Beside it, in a Winnebago where astronauts suited up in a quarantined area, was a red phone on which successful astronauts could talk to the president - Nixon, in this case, who delivers an actual speech (written by William Safire) that was prepared in case real-life astronauts were stranded on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best part of this experience was going into the air-conditioned landing module and examining (though not trying) the toilet and looking through the library, where there were copies of ''Ulysses,'' ''Origin of the Species,'' ''Remembrance of Things Past'' and other bibles of Sachs's religion. Though it weighs 22,000 pounds, it takes only four casters of compressed air to lift it a few inches off the floor, which will happen at the end of the ''mission.'' All I know is that I was so comfortable up there, I didn't want to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''Space Program: Mars'' isn't all fun and games. The basic idea is to demonstrate how much labor is actually involved in mundane activities, and that there is life in every product, even if it's Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may strike some as sheer folly, a waste of time and foamcore. But all inventions seem like the outpourings of the mad, whether they work or not. Sachs is fetishizing the whole process and doing what sculptors always do - mold objects that change our perception of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's more to come. When the show closes, Sachs and his team of specialists will embark on a new mission: to Europa, Jupiter's moon. Speaking into a microphone that carried his voice over the program's P.A. system, Sachs said, ''Tango Sierra in ascent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sachs's ''Space Program: Mars'' continues through June 17 at the Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, New York. The crew performs demonstrations for the public every Thursday from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a nearly flawless nine-day routine, the Dragon stuck the landing, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first commercial mission to ferry supplies into space ended successfully Thursday when a cargo capsule known as the Dragon fell to earth on target in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico, NASA officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tethered to three large parachutes, the unmanned capsule, which had carried about 1,100 pounds of food, water, clothing and equipment to the International Space Station, hit the water at the relatively gentle speed of about 10 miles an hour at 8:42 a.m. local time. It came down about 560 miles west of Baja California, witnessed by technicians from the company that built and flew it, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. They were to load the capsule aboard a barge and haul it back to Long Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This really couldn't have gone better,'' Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said at a televised news conference from the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. ''I'm overwhelmed with joy. It's been 10 years, and to have it go so well is incredibly satisfying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remote-controlled Dragon had separated from the space station about seven hours before splashdown, eventually firing rockets to slow it enough so that it would descend through the atmosphere. Before separation, the station's astronauts loaded it with about 1,400 pounds of used equipment, experiment samples and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the success of what amounted to a trial run for the spacecraft -- there were only a few minor problems during the mission, which began when the Dragon was launched atop a <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rocket from Florida on May 22 -- the company is now poised to begin regular supply missions, with much bigger payloads, to the space station later this year. Since the space shuttle program ended last year, the station has been resupplied by Russian and European spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has been the most successful participant in the government's long-term plan to shift the business of spaceflight to private enterprise, with NASA acting only as managers. The agency's $1.6 billion contract with the company for 12 supply flights still awaits final approval, but Alan J. Lindenmoyer, NASA's manager for commercial spaceflight, said at the news conference that he expected the approval to come quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We became your customer today,'' Mr. Lindenmoyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said that the first regular cargo mission could come by late summer. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also hopes to win a NASA competition to ferry astronauts to the space station, using a larger rocket. And Mr. Musk talks often of an even grander goal: sending humans to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The completion of the Dragon flight, Mr. Musk said, ''really shows that commercial spaceflight can be successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online Correction: June 1, 2012, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The article also omitted one of the international partners in flights to supply the space station since NASA's shuttle program ended last year. Along with Russian spacecraft, the European Space Agency has ferried cargo to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 2, 2012, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article and a headline on Friday about the completion of a private company's first mission to supply the International Space Station described incorrectly the cargo carried by the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> Dragon capsule on its return to earth. The capsule was loaded with about 1,400 pounds of used equipment, experiment samples and other items -- but not garbage. (Trash from the space station goes in other cargo vehicles that are destroyed during their return.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phone call came like a bolt out of the blue, so to speak, in January 2011. On the other end of the line was someone from the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the nation's fleet of spy satellites. They had some spare, unused ''hardware'' to get rid of. Was NASA interested?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when John Grunsfeld, the physicist and former astronaut, walked into his office a year later to start his new job as NASA's associate administrator for space science, he discovered that his potential armada was a bit bigger than he knew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in a room in upstate New York were two telescopes the same size as the famed Hubble Space Telescope, but built to point down at the Earth, instead of up at the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, struggling to get human space exploration moving again, had spent the previous year trying to figure out how good these telescopes were and what, if anything, they could be used for. Working with a small band of astronomers for the past couple of months, Dr. Grunsfeld, famous as the Hubble telescope's in-orbit repairman, has now come up with a plan, which was presented to the public on Monday at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is to turn one of the telescopes loose on the cosmos, pointing in its rightful direction, outward, to investigate the mysterious dark energy that is speeding up the universe's expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the plan succeeds -- and Congress, the Office of Management and Budget and the Academy of Sciences have yet to sign on -- it could shave hundreds of millions of dollars and several years off a quest that many scientists say is the most fundamental of our time and that NASA had said it could not undertake until 2024 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a total game changer,'' said David N. Spergel of Princeton, who is co-chairman of a committee on astronomy and astrophysics for the National Academy of Sciences, which sets priorities for NASA and other agencies. Alan Dressler, of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., who reported to the Academy committee on the scientific potential of a mission with the NRO-1 telescope, as astronomers are calling it, said he was ''really excited.'' He told the gathering, ''I think this is a tremendous opportunity for this community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the two telescopes and some spare parts are still in their clean room at <span class="companylink">ITT Exelis</span>, in Rochester. Michael Moore, who, as NASA's acting deputy director for astrophysics, took the original call last year, has been to see the telescopes several times. He called their optics ''astounding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld described the telescopes as ''bits and pieces'' in various stages of assembly, lacking a camera and other accouterments, like solar panels or pointing controls, of a spacecraft. ''We can't say what they were used for,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the National Reconnaissance Office, Loretta Desio, said, ''This is not something we're going to talk about,'' adding, ''We're hoping this becomes a NASA story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two telescopes have a 94-inch-diameter primary mirror, just like Hubble, but are shorter in focal length, giving them a wider field of view: ''Stubby Hubbles,'' in the words of Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, adding, ''They were clearly designed to look down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said his first reaction was that the telescopes would be a distraction. ''We were getting something very expensive to handle and store,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring he asked a small group of astronomers if one of the telescopes could be used as they were to study dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, he said, was: ''Don't change a thing. It's perfect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have lobbied for a space mission to investigate dark energy ever since observations of the exploding stars known as supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe was speeding up, the discovery that won three American astronomers the Nobel Prize. The fate of the universe, as well as the nature of physics, scientists say, depends on the nature of this dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a decade of wrangling between agencies and astronomers over money and technical specifications had resulted in no consensus on a mission until 2010, when a committee of the National Academy of Sciences that was charged with determining astronomical priorities cobbled together a plan that would do the trick. In its report, ''New Worlds, New Horizons,'' the committee gave that mission the highest priority in space science for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.5-billion project was called Wfirst, for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Among its virtues was that it would search for exoplanets -- planets beyond our solar system. But NASA, hobbled by mismanagement of the James Webb Space Telescope, has said that it will have no money to launch Wfirst until 2024 or later, if all goes well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, given a green light and some money, a mission with the repurposed telescope could be started in 2020. But, Mr. Moore added, ''We have no money.'' Building the telescope can amount to a quarter to a half of the cost of a space astrophysics mission, astronomers said. Dr. Moore estimated that having it already could save the nation $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope's short length means its camera could have the wide field of view necessary to inspect large areas of the sky for supernovae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even bigger advantages come, astronomers say, from the fact that the telescope's diameter, 94 inches, is twice as big as that contemplated for Wfirst, giving it four times the light-gathering power, from which a whole host of savings cascade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of requiring an expensive launch to a solar orbit, the telescope can operate in geosynchronous Earth orbit, complete its survey of the sky four times faster, and download data to the Earth faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a coronagraph, which blocks light from the sun's disk to look for exoplanets, another of Wfirst's goals, the former spy telescope could see planets down to the size of Jupiter around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sounds almost too good to be true, it might be, cautioned Adam Riess, one of the three dark energy Nobelists, who noted that a thorough estimate of the new mission's costs had not been done yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But still, he said, ''When someone hands you a hand-me-down like that, you have to be excited,'' Dr Riess said. ''They're not sitting around at <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said the repurposing of the telescope for dark energy came at a personal cost. He had long dreamed that the Hubble, which he and the other astronaut servicing teams had said goodbye to forever in 2009, might be visited again and upgraded one more time to do the dark energy work. That dream, he admitted, was now dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If for half the cost, you could turn this into a telescope, why would you do that?'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haleakala, Hawaii</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VENUS slides between us and the Sun today, an exceedingly rare spectacle that scientists hope will expand their understanding of our solar system and refine their inquiries about distant planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A transit of Venus has been recorded just six times before; one will not recur until 2117. Each time, astronomers understand it far better than we did the last time; when it is over, our curiosity only grows. Each time, too, it stirs our imaginations. The 1882 transit inspired Edmond-Louis Dupain to paint, on a ceiling at the Paris Observatory, a near-nude Venus, goddess of love, floating across the path of the sun god Helios in his chariot in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you view the real sky this afternoon -- using a safe solar filter if you look directly, or viewing it on a projected image -- you will see a dark spot cross the Sun, its diameter one-thirtieth the size of the Sun's, and so round it might seem a bullet had pierced our star. Four NASA spacecraft will be observing, too -- including two that will measure a drop of about one-tenth of 1 percent in the solar energy that reaches the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By measuring variations in this reduction of light during the transit, we hope to get clues about what happens when any planet, including so-called exoplanets far out in the universe, transits its star. NASA's Kepler spacecraft has found more than 2,000 suspected exoplanets; perhaps 90 percent really are exoplanets, but nobody knows which 90 percent. Insights from this transit may help us find an answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such ambitions could not have been imagined by Johannes Kepler, who observed that planetary orbits were elliptical, not circular (as even Copernicus had thought), and predicted the 1631 transit. Nobody recorded seeing it, but in 1639, 21-year-old Jeremiah Horrocks anticipated another transit, and it became the first ever observed. Horrocks also realized that transits occurred in eight-year pairs, with more than a century between one pair and the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 100 expeditions, from many countries, were sent to observe the next pair, in 1761 and 1769, in hopes that timing a transit would help to determine the solar system's size. The method had been devised by Edmund Halley, of comet fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Admiralty sent a lieutenant, James Cook, to Tahiti, bringing scientists to watch the 1769 transit; he then explored the South Seas (and became a captain). The French abbe Jean-Baptiste Chappe d'Auteroche made his way across Siberia in 1761 for the first transit, then perished in Baja California in 1769, after witnessing the second. He had fallen victim to an epidemic, thought to be typhus, in his quest for the best observation point. It was written of him that he survived to see a lunar eclipse weeks later and died a happy man, having accomplished his aims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less gratified was the French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil. After the British prevented him from landing in Pondicherry, India, to observe the transit of 1761, he stayed in Asia until the next transit, since it was only eight years away. But last-minute clouds spoiled his observations in 1769, and when he sailed home, he found he had been declared dead and his finances had been plundered. Only after a struggle did he reassemble his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next transits, in 1874 and 1882, even newfangled dry-plate photography could not overcome the so-called black-drop effect, an optical phenomenon in which Venus, for about a minute after it enters the solar disk, appears as a mysterious, dark, teardrop-like shape linked to the sky outside. A century before, the resulting uncertainty in timing the transit had limited the accuracy of Halley's plan for measuring the solar system. And it would take spacecraft observations of a transit of Mercury in 1999 before the black-drop effect mystery was solved. (Glenn Schneider of the University of Arizona and I deduced that an effect of the sun's gaseous nature helped explain the phenomenon -- as a result of darkening near the sun's edge and the limits of optical imaging.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the 2004 transit, a NASA spacecraft that we had helped program surprised us by revealing Venus's atmosphere in an arc around the planet's trailing side when half of the planet had entered the solar disk. The atmosphere appeared again, with its arc fading and diminishing, as Venus exited the Sun, like a baby leaving the womb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now my colleagues, students and I hope to make even better observations of Venus's exotic atmosphere when it is backlit by the sun. From North America (except for Alaska and northwestern Canada), only the first hours of transit will be visible before sunset, so we will observe from the solar observatory atop Haleakala, a dormant volcano 10,000 feet tall on the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All six hours of transit will be visible, and the skies are extremely clear here. We are also collaborating with scientists monitoring orbiting spacecraft. We hope to learn not only about the Cytherean atmosphere (in a common story, Roman Venus's Greek equivalent, Aphrodite, was born in the sea near Cythera), but also about how to detect and precisely categorize atmospheres around some exoplanets. The Kepler craft is trying to detect Earthlike planets in the habitable zone near distant stars -- the ''Goldilocks region'' that is not too hot and not too cold for water to be in liquid or gaseous or solid states. Transit observations from Earth may help reach that goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other scientists are using the Hubble Space Telescope, which is orbiting Earth, to try to detect how molecules in Venus's atmosphere affect the sunlight that reaches the moon. Our group has also teamed with others to obtain time on NASA's Cassini mission, which is orbiting in the Saturn system, to try to detect a very tiny drop in the Sun's intensity when Venus goes in transit from that vantage point on Dec. 21. And from Jupiter's vantage point (with reflected light monitored with the Hubble telescope), we hope Hubble can see Venus transit the Sun later this year, and Earth transit the Sun in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, people on Earth can see with their own eyes the beauty spot -- as beautiful as Marilyn Monroe's -- bestowed by Venus on the Sun. It is also a chance to appreciate the dividends we earn from our investments in space research, and the opportunities the universe throws our way to unlock its secrets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, a small black dot will begin moving across the face of the Sun, an event that is turning New York City -- not usually an epicenter of astronomy -- into an interplanetary kind of town, with astronomy buffs and telescope jockeys in parks, on street corners and along piers. The rare astronomical event, known as the transit of Venus, comes in pairs about once every century, with the previous one occurring in 2004. The next one will not take place until 2117, making the event on Tuesday truly a last-chance opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless, of course, it rains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the forecast, which is for clouds and possible rain, astronomy groups are setting up viewing sites around the city, including Union Square, the High Line, Riverside Park South and 125th Street in Harlem, where the temporarily star-struck can go to see the transit safely. It occurs when the orbits of Venus, Earth and the Sun put them into alignment along the same plane. Watching it with the naked eye is dangerous, and all but impossible, given the Sun's blinding glare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the viewing sites, amateur astronomers and academics will have telescopes with special solar filters, as well as projection devices and solar glasses, available to the public. ''In a sense, it is an eclipse,'' said Summer Ash, director of outreach for Columbia University's astronomy department, who will be stationed in the southeast corner of Union Square. ''It's the same phenomenon. It's just that Venus is so much farther away than the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, the transit of Venus, weather permitting, will be visible until sundown, at 8:24, letting New Yorkers see just the first third of the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1700s, scientists realized that the transit of Venus could help determine the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Mathematical models and diagrams stemming from the 1769 transit put the distance at 95 million miles, just 2 million more than what is now accepted to be the average distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we know the distance between the Earth and the Sun, we can use that to get distances to other stars,'' said Jason Kendall, a board member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York and a volunteer ''solar system ambassador'' for NASA. ''Ultimately, the transit of Venus gave us a fundamental measuring stick for all distances in the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kendall will oversee a viewing platform on a pier in Riverside Park South, near 68th Street, on the Upper West Side. He will bring a projection device, fashioned from an inexpensive telescope and a funnel covered with a fabric screen. He is expecting about a dozen other amateur astronomers to bring their own telescopes outfitted with solar filters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other prime locations are also along the Hudson River, with clear views of the sunset: a section of the High Line park, at 14th Street, and the concrete pier at the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum</span>, at 12th Avenue and 46th Street. At the Intrepid, a nonprofit group, NYSkies Astronomy Inc., will have several specially equipped telescopes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Pazmino, the group's co-founder, remembers watching the 2004 transit from Carl Schurz Park on the Upper East Side, when the event was in progress as the sun rose. Conditions were such that the transit was visible with the naked eye. ''There was a very dense haze so that you could look at the Sun directly and most people, including myself, did see Venus,'' he said. ''The sun was orangy, like a pumpkin, and it looked like someone took a pin and poked it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Harlem, Columbia's astronomy department will invite the public to have a look from a sidewalk on 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. There will be projection devices, which allow for multiple views at one time, along with solar glasses and special solar telescopes. ''We're bringing astronomy to people where they are not necessarily looking for it,'' Ms. Ash said. ''Instead of prime locations where a lot of the amateur astronomy community will be, we prefer crowded streetscapes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the clouds conspire to turn the transit into a nonevent here, there is always video. NASA's Web site will be live-streaming the transit from an observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii starting at 5:30 p.m., Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span> will link to NASA's webcast, projecting a portion of the transit on a large screen in its Cullman Hall of the Universe, to be followed by a related film in the Hayden Planetarium. Mr. Kendall was already feeling the tug of the museum's big screen. ''If it's very cloudy, I might pack up my stuff and go there,'' he said. At the Intrepid, Mr. Pazmino vowed to wait and watch, no matter the weather. ''Our philosophy,'' he said, ''is to let Mother Nature kill the event, not human nature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while, according to NASA, there have been 53 transits since 2000 B.C., this is believed to be the first one with its own Twitter hashtag: #venustransit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phone call came like a bolt out of the blue, so to speak, in January 2011. On the other end of the line was someone from the National Reconnaissance Office[http://www.nro.gov/index.html], which operates the nation’s fleet of spy satellites. They had some spare, unused “hardware” to get rid of. Was NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] interested?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when John Grunsfeld, the physicist and former astronaut, walked into his office a year later to start his new job as NASA’s associate administrator for space science, he discovered that his potential armada was a bit bigger than he knew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in a room in upstate New York were two telescopes the same size as the famed Hubble Space Telescope[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/hubble_space_telescope/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], but built to point down at the Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], instead of up at the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, struggling to get human space exploration moving again, had spent the previous year trying to figure out how good these telescopes were and what, if anything, they could be used for. Working with a small band of astronomers for the past couple of months, Dr. Grunsfeld, famous as the Hubble telescope’s in-orbit repairman, has now come up with a plan, which was presented to the public on Monday at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is to turn one of the telescopes loose on the cosmos, pointing in its rightful direction, outward, to investigate the mysterious dark energy[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/science/american-scientists-fear-losing-edge-in-physics.html?pagewanted=all] that is speeding up the universe’s expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the plan succeeds — and Congress, the Office of Management and Budget and the Academy of Sciences have yet to sign on — it could shave hundreds of millions of dollars and several years off a quest that many scientists say is the most fundamental of our time and that NASA had said it could not undertake until 2024 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a total game changer,” said David N. Spergel of Princeton, who is co-chairman of a committee on astronomy and astrophysics for the National Academy of Sciences, which sets priorities for NASA and other agencies. Alan Dressler, of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., who reported to the Academy committee on the scientific potential of a mission with the NRO-1 telescope, as astronomers are calling it, said he was “really excited.” He told the gathering, “I think this is a tremendous opportunity for this community.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the two telescopes and some spare parts are still in their clean room at <span class="companylink">ITT Exelis</span>, in Rochester. Michael Moore, who, as NASA’s acting deputy director for astrophysics, took the original call last year, has been to see the telescopes several times. He called their optics “astounding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld described the telescopes as “bits and pieces” in various stages of assembly, lacking a camera and other accouterments, like solar panels or pointing controls, of a spacecraft. “We can’t say what they were used for,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the National Reconnaissance Office, Loretta Desio, said, “This is not something we’re going to talk about,” adding, “We’re hoping this becomes a NASA story.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two telescopes have a 94-inch-diameter primary mirror, just like Hubble, but are shorter in focal length, giving them a wider field of view: “Stubby Hubbles,” in the words of Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, adding, “They were clearly designed to look down.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said his first reaction was that the telescopes would be a distraction. “We were getting something very expensive to handle and store,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring he asked a small group of astronomers if one of the telescopes could be used as they were to study dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, he said, was: “Don’t change a thing. It’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have lobbied for a space mission to investigate dark energy ever since observations of the exploding stars known as supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe was speeding up, the discovery that won three American astronomers the Nobel Prize[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/nobel_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. The fate of the universe, as well as the nature of physics, scientists say, depends on the nature of this dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a decade of wrangling between agencies and astronomers over money and technical specifications had resulted in no consensus on a mission until 2010, when a committee of the National Academy of Sciences that was charged with determining astronomical priorities cobbled together a plan that would do the trick. In its report, “New Worlds, New Horizons,” the committee gave that mission the highest priority in space science for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.5-billion project was called Wfirst, for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Among its virtues was that it would search for exoplanets[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/science/space/scientists-are-hot-on-trail-of-exoplanets-suitable-for-life.html?pagewanted=all] — planets beyond our solar system. But NASA, hobbled by mismanagement of the James Webb Space Telescope, has said that it will have no money to launch Wfirst until 2024 or later, if all goes well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, given a green light and some money, a mission with the repurposed telescope could be started in 2020. But, Mr. Moore added, “We have no money.” Building the telescope can amount to a quarter to a half of the cost of a space astrophysics mission, astronomers said. Dr. Moore estimated that having it already could save the nation $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope’s short length means its camera could have the wide field of view necessary to inspect large areas of the sky for supernovae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even bigger advantages come, astronomers say, from the fact that the telescope’s diameter, 94 inches, is twice as big as that contemplated for Wfirst, giving it four times the light-gathering power, from which a whole host of savings cascade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of requiring an expensive launch to a solar orbit, the telescope can operate in geosynchronous Earth orbit, complete its survey of the sky four times faster, and download data to the Earth faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a coronagraph, which blocks light from the sun’s disk to look for exoplanets, another of Wfirst’s goals, the former spy telescope could see planets down to the size of Jupiter around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sounds almost too good to be true, it might be, cautioned Adam Riess, one of the three dark energy Nobelists, who noted that a thorough estimate of the new mission’s costs had not been done yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But still, he said, “When someone hands you a hand-me-down like that, you have to be excited,” Dr Riess said. “They’re not sitting around at <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said the repurposing of the telescope for dark energy came at a personal cost. He had long dreamed that the Hubble, which he and the other astronaut servicing teams had said goodbye to forever in 2009, might be visited again and upgraded one more time to do the dark energy work. That dream, he admitted, was now dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If for half the cost, you could turn this into a telescope, why would you do that?” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated, 4:05 p.m. | First, the space shuttle Enterprise came by air. Then, on Wednesday, it arrived again - this time by sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six weeks after the Enterprise made its New York City debut on the back of a 747 jet, it completed its oft-delayed journey to Manhattan in appropriately slow motion. The final act was a precise water ballet involving the shuttle, two barges, three tugboats, a huge floating crane and an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, witnessed by a rapt crowd of several hundred people on piers along the Hudson River, was to pluck the shuttle off the smaller of the barges and hoist it up to the flight deck of the Intrepid, a retired carrier docked on the West Side that is now the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum</span>. Enterprise, which was built in 1976 and was the prototype for the shuttles that flew in space, will be its star attraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 3:45 p.m., about four hours after it arrived in a procession up the river, the crane hoisted the 75-ton shuttle off the barge. When Enterprise was more than 50 feet in the air, the 240-foot boom pivoted into a stiffening breeze and slowly swung the shuttle tail-first over the Intrepid. The crane's cables sang a shrill tune as Enterprise descended to the deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4:02 p.m., the Enterprise had landed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's somewhat surreal still," Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the president of the museum, said as she gazed at the giant model spacecraft perched atop the ship, its nose pointed at New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid was not known for its connections to the space program, but Ms. Marenoff-Zausner and her colleagues managed to persuade the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> to award one of the shuttles to the museum last year. That decision was criticized in Texas, Seattle and some other hubs of the aerospace industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Enterprise had been on display at a branch of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Virginia. When NASA awarded one of the retired orbiters, Discovery, to the Smithsonian, the agency decided that Enterprise would receive the most exposure in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the foundation that runs the Intrepid had to do was pay NASA about $10 million to deliver Enterprise to Kennedy International Airport and then figure out how to get the shuttle onto the ship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few days of weather delays, NASA did its part on April 27, with a throng-pleasing flyover of the city. On Sunday, a tugboat towed the shuttle aboard a barge from the airport around Queens and Brooklyn to Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, after another weather delay, tugs pushed that barge and a much bigger one holding the crane up the Hudson on Wednesday morning. They were saluted by onlookers lining the waterfront and a flotilla that included police boats, ferries, pleasure craft and fireboats spraying water in high arcs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After making U-turns in the river, the tugs parallel-parked the barges near the stern of the retired carrier. Crews of workers in red coveralls and orange flotation vests carefully trussed up the shuttle, attaching a yellow steel sling at four points on the sides of its fuselage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The floating crane, the same one that was used to extricate the <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> plane that Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III had landed nearby in the Hudson in 2009, then lifted the shuttle off the barge. About 15 minutes later, the Enterprise was resting atop the ship and workers were welding the brace behind its front wheels to the flight deck as Matt Woods, the museum's senior vice president for facilities and engineering, watched with relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We battled every element: wind, rain, the tides," said Mr. Woods, who got only four hours of sleep in a trailer next to the shuttle in Jersey City on Tuesday night. But on Wednesday, he said, "Everything went perfect."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the week, he said, he expected his crew to have erected a nylon tent over the shuttle to serve as its temporary home. The museum's trustees hope to find a place to erect a building to house Enterprise permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until then, space buffs will have to pay an additional $6, on top of the regular $22 admission, to enter the shuttle exhibit. It is scheduled to open on July 19.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- China's space agency said on Saturday that it will launch astronauts later in June to perform the country's first manned space docking, the latest step in the country's ambitious plan for space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shenzhou 9 spacecraft will dock with the Tiangong 1 orbital module ''sometime in mid-June,'' according to Xinhua, China's official news agency, quoting an unidentified spokesman for the country's space program. The government did not say how long the mission will last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Niu Hongguang, deputy commander-in-chief of the country's manned space program, said the three-person crew may include female astronauts, Xinhua reported, but the decision will be made ''on the very last condition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday the spacecraft and its carrier rocket were moved to the launch platform at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, a rocket-launching complex in the Gobi Desert in northwest China. In the coming days, tests will be performed on the selected astronauts, the spacecraft, carrier rocket and ground systems, according to Xinhua, citing the spokesman for the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One crew member will remain aboard the Shenzhou 9 as a precautionary measure while the others enter the orbital module, Xinhua said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing announced last December a five-year plan for space exploration that includes launching a space lab and collecting samples from the moon by 2016. The government has previously vowed to reach the moon and launch its own manned space station by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, released by the State Council, China's cabinet, shows how Beijing intends to draw on its military and civilian resources to reach the goals. The People's Liberation Army drives China's space program, and civilian institutions such as universities and laboratories are subject to the military'S efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is considered a leader in the business of launching satellites, but analysts say the country is still years behind the United States in its space program. The Chinese government has relied on its own aerospace engineers and spent billions of dollars in recent years to build its space program. In 2003 the country carried out its first successful human spaceflight, and in 2008 Chinese astronauts took their first spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China completed its first space docking last November when the Shenzhou 8 capsule coupled with the Tiangong 1 orbital module by remote control, an event that was broadcast live on national television and observed by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao from the control center in Beijing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG - Nearly half a century after the Soviet Union sent the first woman into space, China appears ready to send its first female astronaut aloft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Chinese space program, rarely one to miss a chance for some good publicity, is saying little about its female fliers. As is the Chinese custom, the names of the three astronauts for the upcoming Shenzhou 9 mission will not be announced until hours before liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two female astronauts being considered for the flight, which is expected to lift off on Saturday, as my colleague Kevin Drew has reported[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/science/space/china-plans-its-first-manned-space-docking.html]. The mission is expected to feature China's first manned space docking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the huge celebrity enjoyed by pioneering female astronauts in the Soviet Union and the United States, the Chinese women are virtually unknown. Even now, on the brink of an historic launch, they remain sealed off rather than celebrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both women began their careers as transport pilots with the People's Liberation Army Air Force - Captain Wang Yaping[http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/international/english/wang_yaping.htm], 33, was born in Shandong Province, and Major Liu Yang[http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/international/english/liu_yang.htm], who is either 33 or 34, comes from Henan. Both are reportedly married, and Captain Wang and her husband, also a pilot, are believed to have a son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their names were only confirmed last year[http://www.space.com/13853-china-secret-astronaut-names-revealed.html] when it was discovered they had autographed an envelope (along with their five male colleagues) featuring a postage stamp commemorating their astronaut class. They are rarely profiled in the Chinese media, and they make no public appearances, whether at local science fairs or international air shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photographs of the women are rare. An official <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> photo of Ms. Wang is here.[http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=BwJ&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=600&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=j1MtUXXK4JE2WM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum32/HTML/000021.html&amp;docid=kvnVJtB759JxdM&amp;imgurl=http://www.collectspace.com/review/taikonauts_wangyaping01.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=300&amp;ei=hI_VT4G4FM6iiAfBu6yGAw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=274&amp;vpy=33&amp;dur=4393&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=161&amp;ty=213&amp;sig=110962538397478139832&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=129&amp;tbnw=171&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=18&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0,i:77] And low-resolution head shots of both women are here[http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=l7J&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=600&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=Meepw_p8o9_AhM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/326259/20120410/chinese-space-program.htm%3Fpage%3Dall&amp;docid=bp9aTNEJzx4rxM&amp;imgurl=http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/04/10/260422-liu-yang-and-wang-yaping.jpg&amp;w=604&amp;h=434&amp;ei=UpLVT-GAMayOiAfFgs2LAw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=204&amp;vpy=195&amp;dur=2097&amp;hovh=190&amp;hovw=265&amp;tx=175&amp;ty=214&amp;sig=110962538397478139832&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=120&amp;tbnw=169&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=17&amp;ved=1t:429,r:13,s:0,i:115].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A story from Beijing on Monday in The South China Morning Post gave brief descriptions of the women[http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=a7fa484aab6d7310VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liu, who graduated from an aviation college in Changchun, Jilin Province, is known for being tough. She did not let her parents visit her during her four years at the college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when she made her first skydive, she did not immediately call her family to tell them she was safe. Her parents broke down in tears when Ms. Liu finally called them, with her father telling her: "It's good that you are safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wang, whose husband is also a pilot, had no intention of becoming a pilot when she was young, but she changed her mind after being persuaded by a friend to try aviation college. She registered the top scores in the aviation theory examination for two consecutive years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the inexplicable degree of official reticence about women in the Chinese space program, the investigative blogger Tony Quine said more is known about Ms. Wang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She is known to have joined the P.L.A.A.F. as a cadet in 1997, one of 37 members of the so-called '7th Generation' of female pilots[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_Female_Taikonaut_Identified_999.html], and graduated from Aviation University and flight school in 2001 with the rank of First Lieutenant," Mr. Quine wrote in Space Daily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2008, she was one of six female pilots who took part in relief flights after a major earthquake in Sichuan Province, and later that year she was reported to have been involved in flights related to cloud seeding and weather modification for the Olympic Games in Beijing. She has over 1,100 flying hours on her log book."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch of the Shenzhou 9 - atop a Long March-2F rocket - is expected to take place on Saturday, weather conditions permitting at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert. The 10-day mission is scheduled to dock with an orbiting module, Tiangong 1. News reports in China have said no spacewalk will be held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be China's first manned space flight since September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A June 16 launch would mark 49 years since the Soviet Union put the first woman into space - Valentina Tereshkova[http://www.astronautix.com/astros/terhkova.htm].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a story about the historic flight, Ms. Tereshkova, then 26, was described by Seymour Topping, The Times' Moscow correspondent, as "a heavy-set parachutist[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00B13F83E581A7B93C5A8178DD85F478685F9]." A headline called her a "spacewoman."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During her flight she spoke with another cosmonaut, Lt. Col. Valery Bykovsky, who was orbiting in a nearby capsule. Her call sign was "Seagull." His was "Hawk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first American woman in space was Sally K. Ride[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ride-sk.html], who went up June 18, 1983, with the Challenger shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Americans have astronauts, the Russians have cosmonauts and the Indians have vyomanauts. The Chinese often call their spacemen taikonauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Xinhua</span>, the official Chinese news agency, said "taikonaut was coined in 1988 when China started to train astronauts.[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/25/content_10111749.htm] It became well known in 2003 when China sent its first spaceman Yang Liwei to space in the Shenzhou-5 spacecraft."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency cites the Concise Oxford English Dictionary for the term's origins: "a hybrid of the Chinese term 'taikong' (space) and the Greek 'naut' (traveler)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chen Lin, a linguistics professor at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, offered this bit of etymology, as reported by <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span>:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is not the first time that a Chinese word was 'adopted' by users of a foreign language," Mr. Chen said, citing such terms as kung fu, hutong (the small alleys seen in Beijing) and names of Chinese dishes seen in restaurants around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But all the other words that were borrowed by foreign languages users refer to things of China's past, Mr. Chen said. This new word 'shows that China has more to export to the world than just kung fu and Chinese food.' "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI — China sent a crew of three, including the country’s first female astronaut, into space on Saturday to carry out its first manned docking mission, an important step in an ambitious plan to build a Chinese space station by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful launching of the Shenzhou 9 spacecraft, powered by a Long March 2F rocket, was shown live on state television from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert in western China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew is expected to spend up to 20 days in space and dock with the orbiting Tiangong 1 space lab module, a kind of miniature space station, which China launched in September 2011. The crew will conduct experiments and live for a time in the space module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has spent billions in the past decade to build a space program to compete with the United States and Russia, and it plans to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on the moon, perhaps by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country sent its first man into space in 2003, and a Chinese astronaut did a spacewalk in 2008. The manned docking would be considered a milestone for China’s space program and the third major step in developing a space program. China completed a docking by remote control in November when the Shenzhou 8 capsule coupled with the Tiangong 1 orbital module, an event that was broadcast live on national television and observed by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao from the control center in Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching put China’s first woman into space, a 33-year-old air force pilot named Liu Yang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is an important leap forward for China’s manned space program,” said Wu Bangguo, the nation’s top legislator, speaking to the three astronauts before they took flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is China’s first manned spaceflight since September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal, analysts say, is to dock with the space lab as practice for future dockings with the space station that China plans to build. One crew member will remain aboard the Shenzhou 9 spacecraft as a precautionary measure while the others enter the Tiangong 1 orbital module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the mission itself is not unusual, analysts said it extended China’s remarkable pace in developing its space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is the speed with which China is ticking off these boxes in developing their program that is interesting,” said Jeff Kueter, the president of the George C. Marshall Institute, which focuses on how science is used in making public policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days leading up to Saturday’s launching, the Chinese news media ran several profiles of Ms. Liu. The state-run <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> news agency reported that she was from Henan Province in central China and lived in Beijing with her husband. She will be in charge of medical experiments during the mission, <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soviet Union sent the first woman into space in 1963[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/16/newsid_2685000/2685283.stm]. The first American woman in space was Sally Ride[http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/us/woman-in-the-news-cool-versatile-astronaut-sally-kristen-ride-w.html], in 1983. According to China’s state-run news media, the selection process determined that China’s first woman in space should be married, preferably with a child. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing announced a five-year plan for space exploration in December that included a space lab and the collection of samples from the moon by 2016. The government has previously vowed to reach the moon and establish a manned space station by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, released by the State Council, China’s cabinet, shows how Beijing intends to draw on its military and civilian resources to reach the goals. The People’s Liberation Army drives China’s space program, and civilian institutions like universities and laboratories are subject to the military’s efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is considered a leader in the business of launching satellites, but analysts say it is still years behind the United States.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As most of us who have worked in and around politics for any length of time know, if a certain issue is not an immediate vote-getter or "tangible" for a politician, there is a better than even chance that the issue will be ignored or deposited upon the furthest back-burner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many of our elected officials, everyday political calculation comes down to this: "What's best for my re-election and what's best for my party?"&nbsp;In that order.&nbsp;With fewer and fewer people in power whose first thought is: "What's the best decision I can make that will be in the best interests of my constituents?" It's no wonder that more young people are giving up on politics while their elders abandon the political parties to become Independents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the if-it's-not-tangible-and-I-can't-game-it-immediately-to-my-benefit test may be great for a politician, it's often very bad for the country. "Tangible" being political slang for "that federal office building will now be located in my district."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the "non-tangible," a great example would be our space program. Or to be more accurate, our non-space program. It has never really been relevant for most of our politicians or presidents. The truth is that only one president really thought that space exploration was a tangible national vote-getter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever his real motivation, on Sept.12, 1962 at Rice University, John F. Kennedy stated in no uncertain terms that in the interests of science, industry and national security, the United States would become the "world's leading spacefaring nation." And so we did - for nearly five decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, that preeminence is nothing more than a fading memory. While President Obama - who as a candidate made it very clear that he valued education over space exploration - may have pushed our human spaceflight program over the cliff, other presidents led it to the edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Florida a key battleground state in the presidential election, the White House and the political appointees at NASA will argue furiously that the president has not walked away from our human space program. They will point to his plans to land astronauts on the asteroids[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2010-06-20-asteroid-obama-nasa-plan_N.htm#.T_SD4jFKfN0.email] one day. Right. That goal, exactly like George H.W. Bush's plan in 1989 to send astronauts to Mars, is simply fiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I worked in politics for a long time, but I began life as a space geek. I started a scrapbook on the Soviet space program when I was 10 and decades later got to write a book about the 12 men who have walked on the moon. After my time in government, I worked as a consultant for NASA and the Space Shuttle team. In other words, I admit that I have always been a fan of humans in space. Any humans in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the humans who are now winning the space race come from the People's Republic of China.&nbsp;It is clear from their own propaganda that China means to replace us as the "world's leading spacefaring nation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been argued in the past that while the United States and other Western nations see the future in terms of months or years, the Chinese see it in terms of decades or even centuries. With that perspective in mind, the Chinese government intends to win not the space race, but the space marathon. They intend to take military, industrial and scientific advantage there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the just completed launch and recovery of China's first female astronaut - Liu Yang[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18471236], who with two male astronauts, was part of a very successful 13 day mission to dock with a Chinese space station - many in the media covered it as a human-interest story or even a politically correct equal-rights story.&nbsp;Nice, but the completely wrong way to view the Chinese achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naïve and irresponsible beliefs aside, China's space program is essentially military. Its every function is designed to carry out a military objective or one that improves the welfare of the state.&nbsp;Nothing else matters to the Chinese leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward that end, the Chinese government has been investing a great deal of time and talent in a wide range of anti-satellite weapons and technologies. Aside from direct ascent kinetic kill vehicles (like the one it tested in 2007[http://nautilus.org/apsnet/assessing-chinas-asat-program/]), the Chinese military space program is also working on laser, jamming, microwave and cyber-weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why?&nbsp; Because the Chinese leadership - the same leadership that has made hacking our military and commercial computers a priority - understands that no nation on earth is more dependent for its overall survival on its satellites than the United States. Satellites control our military communications, our financial transactions and our day-to-day lives.&nbsp;What if they went dark or were destroyed in orbit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese leaders - and others - would certainly say that a military advantage in space is "tangible" and a goal worth attaining. But preeminence is space is about much more than military advantage.&nbsp; Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span> in New York, outlined that argument when he told Popular Science earlier this year[http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-01/popsci-qampa-neil-degrasse-tyson-politics-new-frontiers-and-science-evangelism]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If China sets up a permanent base on the moon, and tries to explore Mars on a time scale shorter than ours, that will be another space race. I am just certain of it. I am trying to get people to do this without having to view it as an act of war, or an act of a response to an adversary. One way is because of economics; the government could do this, and they could say, "The economic return is the scientists and technologists who invent the new tomorrow." Space exploration is the carrot that incites people to become scientifically literate. So I view it as an economic development plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it's time for the president and his Republican opponent to elevate a few issues to the "tangible" list regardless of personal or partisan self-interest. As China launches military satellite after military satellite while declaring its intention to colonize the moon, maybe preeminence in space should be one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the transition period after he defeated John McCain, Obama contemplated combining the best of the space programs at the Pentagon and NASA[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOvrNO0OJ41g] to compete with the rapidly accelerating Chinese space program. For whatever reasons, he declined to follow through on that plan when he became president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president should dust off those plans. Given the fact that during the height of the war in Iraq, our government was spending nearly a billion dollars a day[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/documents/Iraq_Economic_Costs.pdf], I suspect the American people would support spending a month's worth of that budget every year to ensure that our assets in space and our future on earth are more secure. But to support it, they first need to be convinced of its importance. So do our leaders.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>1048 words</div><div>11 July 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video is called “Seven Minutes of Terror,” and describes, with the suspense and cinematography of a movie preview, what will happen next month when a one-ton spacecraft launched in November smacks into Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve got literally seven minutes to get from the top of the atmosphere to the surface of Mars, going from 13,000 miles an hour to zero,” Tom Rivellini, a NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] engineer, tells the camera with a grim face and deadpan delivery. “If any one thing doesn’t work just right, it’s game over.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Posted last month on YouTube[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s], the video has succeeded in an area where <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has a mixed track record: using social media and other tools of the 21st century to whip up interest in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite minimal publicity, “Seven Minutes” has been racking up views and attracting droll commentary on the impending arrival of the rover, which goes by the name of Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Come on, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>,” one person said in a comment on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, “All that is missing in this blockbuster trailer is Megan Fox as the chief scientist.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe <span class="companylink">NASA</span> can get Mr. Moviefone to do the mission commentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the space agency’s public utterances are dry stuff; recent news releases include “NASA Selects Contracts for Environmental Remediation Services”[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/jun/HQ_C12-026_KSC_Remediation.html] and “NASA Awards Five Universities Funding for Learning Opportunities.”[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/jun/HQ_12-220_ISS_Natl_Lab.html] Like other federal agencies, it is not allowed to spend money to toot its own horn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t try to market,” said Robert Jacobs, a NASA spokesman. “We don’t try to sell anything. Our job is to clean the windows to give the American public a better view of their space program.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet the space officials have tried to add a measure of cute and playful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> ran a contest to name a module on the International Space Station. But the comedian Stephen Colbert co-opted it, exhorting his viewers to vote for “Colbert.” That name ended up winning, with more than 230,000 votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> put aside the results and named the module Tranquility, commemorating the landing site of Apollo 11. But the space agency did later name an exercise treadmill on the space station after Mr. Colbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the educational program for the James Webb Space Telescope, the planned successor to Hubble that has been troubled by delays and cost overruns, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> created a game in which players create their own space telescope[http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/build.html], but to underwhelming reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Too bad this game is not totally realistic so as to let people play with schedule and cost,” wrote Keith Cowing, a frequent critic of the space agency, on his Web site NASAWatch.com[http://nasawatch.com/]. “This way they’d REALLY learn how <span class="companylink">NASA</span> satellites are built (or not built).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> seems to have a hit. The “Seven Minutes” video, viewed more than half a million times, starts with a computer-generated animation of a capsule falling toward the Red Planet, then uses stark lighting, thumping music, fancy graphics and dramatic narration to tease the landing of the Curiosity, a $2.5 billion mission that aims to see if the building blocks of life existed on early Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the East Coast, the landing will happen in the wee hours of Monday, Aug. 6 — or nighttime on Aug. 5 on the West Coast — and it will be competing for mindspace with the Summer Olympics. That is not stopping the Atlanta Science Tavern[http://marslandingparty.com/], which organizes popular science talks, from going all out for an evening that starts with five talks on planetary science and segues into “full-fledged party mode” at midnight when <span class="companylink">NASA</span> television coverage of the landing starts. The festivities will conclude at 3 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already 173 people have signed up. “It’s science,” said the group’s director, Marc Merlin, “but it’s also a public celebration of scientific achievement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Merlin said he was thinking of bringing a model of the Mars rover that would descend on a rope à la the lighted ball in Times Square on New Year’s Eve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/new_year/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. “That would be the decoration I would like to do,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, the seven minutes of terror will be more like 21 minutes of suspense. The capsule containing the Curiosity will hit the top of the Martian atmosphere just before 1:11 a.m. Eastern time on Aug. 6. The rover will be on the surface about seven minutes later. The only uncertainty is whether the rover will be in one piece or in smithereens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, no one will know the outcome for almost 14 minutes as the spacecraft’s radio signals travel 150 million miles from Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When people look at it, it looks crazy,” says Adam Steltzner, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> engineer, in the “Seven Minutes” video as he describes the Rube Goldberg-esque landing process — heat shield, parachute, rocket engines and finally a hovering crane that lowers the rover to the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Text flashes across the screen: “6 vehicle configurations,” then “76 pyrotechnic charges.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy” Mr. Steltzner goes on to say, before asserting more confidently, “It is the result of reasoned engineering thought.” Pause. “But it still looks crazy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slick video is “definitely a step up,” said Reid Gower, a 26-year-old Canadian who was so frustrated by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>’s previous efforts that last year he put together NASA snippets into a promotional video[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY59wZdCDo0&amp;list=PLF17F07CFC3208E29&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video] that he thought the space agency should be making. “That’s along the lines of what I feel they could be doing, something that’s education but also engaging. It’s not static and dry. It has emotional content in it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 12, 2012, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a dramatic <span class="companylink">NASA</span> video that is drawing attention to the expected landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars next month misstated the time the capsule carrying the rover is predicted to enter the Martian atmosphere. It is 1:11 a.m. Eastern time on Aug. 6 — not 12:11 a.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Virgin Galactic, George T. Whitesides, said four customers had already put down deposits to book satellite launchings on the new vehicle, called LauncherOne, which Virgin Galactic said could begin by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LauncherOne is a two-stage rocket capable of carrying payloads of up to 500 pounds into orbit for less than $10 million a launch.

LauncherOne will then fire its engines and lift the satellite into its final orbit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto is still not a planet, but it does boast an impressive entourage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that they had spotted a fifth moon orbiting Pluto, which they already knew had four. The discovery, made with the Hubble Space Telescope, gives Pluto more moons than Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement, initially conveyed on Twitter, caught the attention of some science-minded comedians on the same medium. ''It's like, since being kicked out of the planet gang, it's decided to form a rival solar system,'' said Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist and stand-up comic in Britain. ''Good on Pluto, I say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of the moon, known simply as P5 for now, by itself does not change the terms of the ''Is Pluto a planet?'' debate. Moons are not a prerequisite for planethood -- unless one wanted to first expel Mercury and Venus, which are moonless -- and many smaller bodies are also known to have moons orbiting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that did not stop top planetary scientists from friendly taunting on Twitter. One comment came from Michael Brown, the astronomer at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> who discovered an object in the outer solar system that appeared larger than Pluto and set off the chain of events that culminated in the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet in 2006. ''The REAL implication of 5+ moons for Pluto?'' he wrote. ''Even things which aren't planets can be complicated and interesting. But you knew that. Right?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Just in case you are not certain of Dr. Brown's views, his Twitter name is ''plutokiller.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of NASA's New Horizon's spacecraft, which is currently speeding toward a close encounter with Pluto in July 2015, wrote a tart reply: ''Does CalTech cultivate old school ideas? Get used to planets unlike Earth ruling. Accept Nature. Breathe Mike. Breathe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the new moon could spell trouble for Dr. Stern and New Horizons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances that New Horizons would crash into P5 -- a tiny nugget most likely no wider than Manhattan is long -- or one of the other moons are vanishingly small. But Pluto could be enshrouded by smaller debris shed by the moons. With New Horizons flying through at 30,000 miles per hour, ''even small particles that weigh less than a milligram can be lethal to the spacecraft,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble pictures of Pluto, led by Mark Showalter, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Seti Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., were conducted to help identify safe regions for the NASA spacecraft. For now, not much is known about P5 other than that it is a speck of light, about one hundred-thousandth as bright as Pluto, that orbits at a distance of 26,000 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons team is coming up with a backup plan that would let it change the flyby -- currently planned to pass less than 7,000 miles above the surface of Pluto -- to a safer distance if it turns out that neighborhood is too cluttered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern said the mission would still meet all of its main objectives. ''That doesn't leave us in the poorhouse,'' he said. ''We don't get some of the icing of going up close.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 14, 2012, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the discovery of a fifth moon orbiting Pluto quoted incorrectly from a comment by Dean Burnett, a British neuroscientist and stand-up comic. In commenting on the discovery, Mr. Burnett said, ''Good on Pluto, I say'' -- not ''Good one Pluto, I say.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By PATRICK MCGEEHAN   </div><div>547 words</div><div>18 July 2012</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not even space agency bosses can catch a cab in Midtown Manhattan during a torrential thunderstorm and a cabbie shift change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several officials from the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> learned that lesson on Wednesday afternoon when they tried to leave the new space shuttle exhibit at the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum</span> on the West Side. Just as a press preview of the temporary home for Enterprise, the prototype for NASA's space shuttles, was wrapping up, thunder boomed overhead and winds whipped the giant tent inflated on the Intrepid's flight deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rainwater seeped under the tent as camera crews from television networks around the world filmed the Enterprise from all angles. The exhibit, which opens to the public on Thursday, lets visitors walk under the shuttle and climb a staircase for a nose-to-nose view. The museum is charging an additional $6 to buy passes, on top of the museum entry for adults of $24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Bolden, the administrator of NASA, who awarded the Enterprise to the Intrepid, is expected to attend the opening ceremony on Thursday, along with several former astronauts and city officials. Mr. Bolden's deputy, Lori Garver, said Wednesday that she was pleased to see how the Enterprise was displayed in the enclosure, which was proving to be weatherproof as she spoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very important to NASA that it be special and Intrepid has helped make it that way," Ms. Garver said. "So we're very pleased."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before she arrived, one of the Enterprise's test pilots, Fred W. Haise, recounted what it was like to steer back to earth a space shuttle that had no engine. "As a pilot, it was a great flying machine," said Mr. Haise, who was at the helm of Enterprise for five test flights in 1977. "It had what we call good handling qualities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for whether it belonged on a retired aircraft carrier tied up near the theater district and a block from a strip club, he said he had no objection. "Maybe it'll educate some of those people into leading a better life," Mr. Haise said with a grin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Museum officials expect to use the exhibit as a launching pad for a fund-raising campaign to pay for a permanent home for the Enterprise, either on the pier next to the carrier or across the West Side Highway. Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the museum's president, said she did not yet know how much money the museum's foundation would need to raise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, she said, "We feel very proud that we have excited the astronauts. That's not easy to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is catching cab at 5 p.m. in Midtown in a downpour. So Ms. Garver and her associates from NASA donned plastic ponchos and puddle-jumped along 46th Street toward their hotel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The life of the NASA astronaut and science campaigner Sally Ride was cut short by pancreatic cancer[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/science/space/sally-ride-trailblazing-astronaut-dies-at-61.html?hp] on Monday, but her influence will long endure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's page of condolences[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/people/features/ride.html] is a vital stop. There's a rich discussion of her pioneering achievements under way on Twitter, where the science and space journalist Miles O'Brien said "she is to the shuttle era what Neil Armstrong is to Apollo[https://twitter.com/milesobrien/status/227529360226254848]" and noted her participation on NASA panels[https://twitter.com/milesobrien/status/227515640758554624] on the destruction of the Challenger and Columbia shuttles and the future of human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This excerpt from Denise Grady's fine obituary[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/science/space/sally-ride-trailblazing-astronaut-dies-at-61.html?hp] says a lot:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her early days at NASA, Dr. Ride trained in parachute jumping, water survival and acclimatization to weightlessness and the huge G-forces of a rocket launch. She learned to fly a jet plane. She also switched from physics to engineering and helped to develop a robotic arm for the space shuttle. The Challenger commander, Robert Crippen, chose her for the 1983 mission in part because of her expertise with the device. She was part of a crew of five that spent about six days in space, during which she used the arm to deploy and retrieve a satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Cape Canaveral, many in the crowd of 250,000 that watched the launch wore T-shirts that said, "Ride, Sally Ride."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, Gloria Steinem, then editor of the magazine Ms., said, "Millions of little girls are going to sit by their television sets and see they can be astronauts, heroes, explorers and scientists."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, I was impressed with Ride's passion for improving science education. She had a particular interest in inspiring girls to dive into science and engineering. But her company, Sally Ride Science[https://www.sallyridescience.com/], was more broadly dedicated to the vital art of conveying science as a story rather than a set of dusty facts. (Editors there interviewed me after my North Pole reporting trip for a book on science-related careers[https://www.sallyridescience.com/files/classset/member/career/blm/EnvironSci_EnvironReporter.pdf].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My last substantive e-mail exchange[http://revkin.tumblr.com/post/27860716833/with-passing-of-sally-ride-today-pancreatic] with Ride came in 2008, after&nbsp;I wrote on the 40th anniversary of the Earthrise photograph[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/happy-birthday-earthrise/]&nbsp;snapped during the Apollo 8 mission. Here's her reflection on the meaning of that image, and humanity's leap beyond the atmosphere:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than anything else, our venturing into space has taught us to appreciate Earth - it's revolutionized our view of our planet and our understanding of its complexity, and made us see the impact that we're having on it.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a bad year to bet against Albert Einstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring physicists had to withdraw a sensational report that the subatomic particles known as neutrinos were going faster than light, Einstein's cosmic speed limit; they discovered they had plugged in a cable wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have reported that they have explained one of the great mysteries of the space age, one that loomed for 30 years as a threat to the credibility of Einsteinian gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story starts with the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, which went past Jupiter and Saturn in the late 1970s and now are on their way out of the solar system. In the 1980s it became apparent that a mysterious force was slowing them down a little more than should have been expected from gravity of the Sun and planets..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was there an unknown planet or asteroid out there tugging on the spacecraft? Was it drag from interplanetary gas or dust? Something weird about the spacecraft? Or was something wrong in our calculation of gravity out there in the dark?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That last explanation would have been big news indeed. Much of what we know about the universe -- for example, the existence of dark matter, which seems to swaddle and shape the galaxies, and of dark energy, which seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe -- comes from presuming that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity as the warping of space-time geometry -- is correct over cosmic distances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General relativity has passed every test on Earth. Without correcting for it, GPS systems would not work. But some theorists have suggested that if gravity behaved differently over large distances from what Einstein thought, it would relieve astronomers of the embarrassing need to posit that 96 percent of the universe consists of various kinds of unknown dark stuff. A similar, but larger, kind of deviation from Einsteinian theory could explain the Pioneer anomaly, as it is called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pioneers 10 and 11 were launched in 1972 and 1973, respectively, and are now both about 10 billion miles out. They were last heard from in 2003, when the radio signal from Pioneer 10 got too weak to be detected. They were the first spacecraft to go past Jupiter and Saturn (though their biggest impact on pop culture until then might have been a controversy over the nude human figures on a plaque designed for the benefit of any distant aliens who might find them).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, however, when John D. Anderson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and his colleagues discovered that the spacecraft were running a little late on their timetable to eternity, it seemed as if general relativity might be up for grabs -- allowing the news media to ask their favorite science question: Was Einstein wrong? There was talk of a special deep space probe whose only mission would be to track its own movements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect was slight -- slowing the spacecraft by about 300 miles a year -- but the crack interplanetary navigators at J.P.L., who can slip a probe through Saturn's rings or buzz the moons of Jupiter, take great pride in their knowledge of the forces and foibles of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slava G. Turyshev, a Russian physicist and gravitational expert working at the laboratory, heard the challenge and took it on, feeling ''a sense of responsibility to get to the bottom of it.'' And so he set out to reconstruct the history of the Pioneer voyages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that would be easy. But the Pioneers spanned the history of the space age and also of the computer age, occasioning a major effort in what Dr. Turyshev calls ''space archaeology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues had to scour NASA labs for old punch cards and magnetic tapes and for vintage devices that could read the data stored on them -- then reformat all that data to a single modern standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, that meant ascertaining the positions of every antenna in NASA's Deep Space Network to an accuracy of one centimeter over all that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took much longer than Dr. Turyshev had imagined, and he had to depend on money from the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span> as well as from NASA to keep the project going, all the time aware that nobody was ever likely to retrace his footsteps. So he had better get it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more we learned, the less optimistic we became about new physics,'' he said. It became apparent that the fault with the Pioneers' travels turned out to lie not in the stars or the shape of space-time but in the spacecraft themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As designed, they radiated more heat in one direction from the circuits and generators that produced their electricity. And that imbalance, Dr. Turyshev and his colleagues concluded in a recent paper in Physical Review Letters, was all that was needed to explain the Pioneers' behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gravity did not need to be fixed. Einstein was right again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact he was doubly right, as it turns out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that light, of which heat radiation is one form, can carry momentum and thus a propulsive force is implicit in the basic equations of electromagnetism. A comet's tail, blown by sunlight, is one example. But it acquired new visceral meaning when Einstein, beginning in 1905, showed that light can be thought of as little particles -- now called photons -- that carry energy and momentum. As with bullets, if you shoot them in one direction, there will be a recoil in the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you drive at night, Dr. Turyshev explained, ''your high beams would emit photons and it would push you back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Pioneers' problem is that they have been driving the solar system with their high beams on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Turyshev said he had set out in search of new physics. When I asked him if he was disappointed at the final results, he laughed and replied: ''Of course. People were ready for something big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, the Einsteinian explanation ''also helps.'' The findings should help in designing new spacecraft for sensitive missions like measuring gravitational waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a win-win,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian cargo spaceship experimenting with a new type of autopilot failed to dock with the International Space Station on Tuesday, in the latest glitch for the Russian space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space officials said the malfunction should not be considered a serious setback. The ship that malfunctioned had already docked with the station to unload supplies. It decoupled on Monday and backed off to try out the new autopilot, which has smaller hardware and is supposed to be more accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the glitch recalled the near-destruction of the Mir space station and the threat to its crew in 1997, when a Progress craft, experimenting with a remote-control approach, bumped into the module and ripped open a hole in the station's airtight skin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new case, there was no threat of a collision. The spaceship, a workhorse called Progress-M, was 100 miles away when the autopilot failed, the Russian space agency said in a statement. Controllers backed the vessel -- basically a flying cylinder with stubby space wings -- 300 miles from the station, and it will try to dock again on Sunday. If the autopilot fails again, the controllers will simply send the craft back to earth for an ocean landing, and engineers will set about fixing the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aleksandr Zheleznyakov, a scientist with the Federation of Russian Cosmonautics, said in a telephone interview that all hardware, including that for space, takes time to perfect. ''Failures and mishaps of all sorts are just par for the course in the creation of new equipment,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the glitch is the latest for the Russian system of rockets and manned and unmanned spacecraft, which the United States has relied on to keep American astronauts in orbit since the retirement of the space shuttle program, and before private-sector space transport is ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, a Russian rocket carrying a Progress ship sailed into a Siberian forest rather than into orbit because of a breakdown in its third-stage motor. This was alarming because NASA astronauts fly on similar rockets, as the only means for Americans to reach space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unmanned flights are less critical. The space agencies of Europe and Japan also launch cargo vehicles. In May, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, an American company, sent its first vessel, called a Dragon, to the space station.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rochester</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOMETIME this year Voyager 1, a probe sent from Earth 35 years ago, will cross a threshold no human-fashioned object has reached before. Passing through a sun-driven shock wave at the edge of the solar system, it will reach the icy dominions of interstellar space. Voyager is one of the fastest vessels we've ever blown out of Earth's gravity well. Still, after three and a half decades of hyper-velocity spaceflight, it will take another 700 centuries for the craft to cross the distance to the nearest star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short of a scientific miracle of the kind that has never occurred, our future history for millenniums will be played out on Earth and in the ''near space'' environment of the other seven planets, their moons and the asteroids in between. For all our flights of imagination, we have yet to absorb this reality. Like it or not, we are probably trapped in our solar system for a long, long time. We had better start coming to terms with what that means for the human future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we know this, on some level. But in a culture saturated with inbred notions of ''progress'' and an obsession with worlds seemingly just beyond our grasp, there is an expectation that sooner rather than later, we will be building an interstellar culture. In a kind of cosmic version of Manifest Destiny we assume that, unless something terrible happens, our science will be taking us to the stars sometime in the next few hundred years. Simply say ''warp drive'' to just about anyone and see if they know what you mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From ''Star Trek'' to ''Star Wars,'' from warp drive to hyperdrive -- the idea of rapid interstellar space travel is such a deep meme for cultural visions of space and our future that Hollywood films don't even have to waste time introducing them to the audience. You pull a lever and zap -- you are in a new star system. How many people would be surprised to know that warp drive isn't even a coherent concept, let alone a near-future technology?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is we propel ourselves into space using much the same physics as the Chinese played with when they discovered what we came to call gunpowder more than 1,400 years ago. Blowing stuff up under us is just about the only way we know how to travel through the void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the distances between the stars, that method simply won't cut it. Even if we could find a way to increase the speed of our spacecraft a hundredfold -- about the same ratio of speeds between a horse-drawn cart and a 747 jet plane -- they would still take almost a thousand years to reach nearby stars, and as long to return. And while exciting theoretical research is under way into pilotless probes to the stars, the real possibility of large-scale human interstellar culture is considerably less thrilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. No salvation from population pressure on the shores of alien worlds. No release from the threats of biosphere degradation in the promise of new biospheres. No escape from our own destructive tendencies by spreading out among the stars like seedpods in the wind. For as many epochs in the future as there are epochs of human history in the past, we may simply have to make do, get by with what we have and, in the end, learn to get along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was just 15 when Voyager 1 left on its long journey. At that age I already knew I wanted nothing more than to be an astronomer. I was also sure that humanity's future, even on the time scale of centuries, would be played out in the theater of the stars. Voyager's departure on its interstellar mission convinced me we were well on our way toward that grand future where anything would be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today I am still in awe of that tiny box of electronics as it sails to the edge of the solar wind. I still believe it represents the best of human genius, ambition and hope. It is through these qualities that, I believe, we have taken the full measure of the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what we've learned in doing so brings me, as an adult and as an astrophysicist, to the hardest and most inconvenient truth of all. While our children's children's great-grandchildren will live with ever more powerful technology, they will also live ever more intimately with ever more billions of others in this, our corner of the cosmos. Looking back and forward, my bets are now on that same human genius, ambition and hope to rise to the occasion. We will have no other choice. There will be nowhere else to go for a very long time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, a spacecraft containing Curiosity — a car-size, nuclear-powered planet rover — is coasting at 8,000 miles per hour toward Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], nearing the end of a journey that began in November. With tightening budgets, it is the last big hurrah for NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s planetary program for quite a few years. Packed with ingenious new instruments, the rover promises to provide the best-ever examination of the Red Planet, digging up clues to a profound question: Could there ever have been life there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the coming week, the pull of gravity will accelerate the spacecraft to 13,000 miles per hour, and early Monday morning Eastern Daylight Time, it is scheduled to execute a series of astoundingly complicated maneuvers and place the rover on the surface. Its new home will be the Gale Crater, just south of the equator, a 96-mile-wide bowl punched out by a meteor more than 3.5 billion years ago. It is one of the lowest places on Mars, which should help advance Curiosity’s $2.5 billion mission[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html]: studying the environment of early Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Water flows downhill, and that’s where we’re going,” John P. Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> who serves as the mission’s project scientist, said during a news conference this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bits of the Martian past may lie in the rocks at the bottom of the crater. Over the past decade, NASA’s robotic spacecraft have turned up convincing evidence that eons ago the planet held one of the prerequisites for life. Water flowed on Mars, at least on occasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life’s other prerequisites are carbon-based molecules and energy. Sunshine or volcanic heat could have provided the necessary energy. With Curiosity, the search is on for the carbon-based molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think this is the Hubble Space Telescope[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/hubble_space_telescope/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of Mars exploration,” said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA’s associate administrator in charge of the science mission directorate. (He is best known as the Hubble repairman, flying on three space shuttle[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/space_shuttle/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] missions to refurbish and upgrade the telescope.) “This is the first time that we have a real analytical laboratory heading to the surface.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before Curiosity can make any discoveries, it has to land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the control room at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/] in Pasadena, Calif., it will still be Sunday evening when the nervous wait begins. First will come word that the spacecraft containing Curiosity has entered the Martian atmosphere. Just seven minutes later, the spacecraft must flawlessly execute a series of complex maneuvers to land the rover on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, the friction of Mars’ thin air rushing past the heat shield will have slowed the spacecraft to 1,000 miles per hour. A 51-foot-wide parachute will pop out, generating up to 65,000 pounds of drag force. Then the heat shield will pop off so that the radar can find the landing site in Gale Crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the parachute drag, the spacecraft will be barreling toward the surface at 200 miles per hour. Next it will cut away the parachute and ignite its descent engines to slow down further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last three NASA rovers — Sojourner in 1997 and Spirit and Opportunity in 2004 — had similar landing systems, except for the final step. For those three, a cocoon of air bags inflated around the rover, which was then dropped the last 50 feet or so, bouncing and rolling until it came to a stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Curiosity, about the size of a Mini Cooper, is five times as heavy as Spirit or Opportunity, making air bags impractical. It would be equivalent of trying to cushion a car hitting a brick wall at highway speed without any damage to the car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Curiosity will be lowered by cable all the way to the ground from the hovering rocket stage in what NASA calls a sky crane maneuver. Once Curiosity bumps into Mars at a gentle 1.7 miles per hour, the cable will be cut, and the rocket stage will fly off to crash about a third of a mile away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Is it crazy?” Doug McCuistion, director of NASA’s Mars exploration program, asked rhetorically during the news conference. “Well, not so much. Once you get comfortable, once you understand it, it’s not a crazy concept.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA engineers who devised the sky crane maneuver say that after thorough testing of the different parts of the system and numerous computer simulations, they are confident that they have built something that will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the simulated world, we’ve landed on Mars millions of times,” one of the engineers, Steven Lee, said in an interview. “I’m actually very comfortable. I’m more comfortable with the impending landing than I was with the launch.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, success is not guaranteed. The Curiosity landing is the “hardest NASA robotic mission ever attempted,” Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it survives, Curiosity will come to rest about 1:17 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. NASA’s Mars Odyssey orbiter[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/odyssey/] will be passing overhead, in position to relay radio transmissions from Curiosity to Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. About 14 minutes later, the fate of Curiosity may be known at mission control. (NASA warns that with the vagaries of space communications, a day or two could pass before confirmation of a successful landing reaches Earth.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers and scientists will spend several weeks checking out the condition of the rover. A few photographs will be beamed back the first few days, first in black and white, then in color. One of the first chores will be a software upgrade for Curiosity’s computers. The first drive is most likely more than a week after landing. The first flexing of the rover’s robotic arm would occur after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In a couple of months, we’ll be on the road to Mount Sharp,” said Dr. Grotzinger, the project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For reasons no one can quite explain, a three-mile-high mountain, Aeolis Mons, stands at the center of Gale Crater. Informally known as Mount Sharp, in honor of Robert P. Sharp[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/14/us/robert-sharp-dies-at-92-linked-study-of-planets.html], a pioneering planetary scientist at Caltech, it is taller than any mountain in the continental United States. Orbiting spacecraft have already observed that Mount Sharp consists of layered rocks presumably formed out of sediment that settled at the bottom of Gale over millions of years. Later the sediment was somehow scoured out, leaving Mount Sharp at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The layers, scientists believe, will provide a history book about early Mars. Orbiters have spotted at the base of the mountain signs of clays — minerals that form in the presence of water and that point to an environment that was less acidic than present-day Mars. As Curiosity crawls up the mountain, it will roll across younger and younger rocks, and the changes could tell how the environment of Mars changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that task, Curiosity is carrying some of the most sophisticated science tools ever devised. A rock-vaporizing laser called ChemCam[http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/Instruments/ChemCam/] can turn a smidgen of rock into a puff of glowing, superhot gas from a distance of up to 25 feet. From the colors of light emitted by the gas, ChemCam can identify elements in the rock. A rock full of carbon, for example, would merit a closer look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is really designed to be a sentry or advance guard for the rover and identify the most interesting samples,” said Roger C. Wiens, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory[http://www.lanl.gov/] who is the instrument’s principal investigator. ChemCam can also vaporize dust on a rock to get a better look at its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other instruments include a weather station; a device that shoots particles into the rock and measures X-rays coming out; and several cameras, including one that mimics the hand lens of a geologist for close-up looks at rocks. The size of a microwave oven, the biggest and probably most ambitious of the instruments is called Sample Analysis at Mars[http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/699/marsSAM.shtml] — Sam for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam contains 74 cups for studying ground-up rock. Most samples will be heated to 1,800 degrees, and three different instruments will be used to identify what gases are released, including the possibility of carbon-based molecules known as organics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confusingly, organic molecules can arise from nonliving chemical reactions, so the presence of organics would not prove the existence of life. Rather, the discovery of such molecules would add to the possibility of life on Mars long ago — or perhaps even today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be the first search for organics since NASA’s two Viking landers[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/viking/] in 1976. The two Vikings saw no signs of organics, which led to the dispiriting conclusion that there was no possibility of life ever on Mars. (A separate experiment did have results consistent with the existence of microbes in the soil, but most scientists concluded that it was the result of some odd, nonliving chemical reactions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research a couple of years ago[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/science/space/04mars.html], however, suggested that the presence in the soil of chemicals known as perchlorates could have destroyed all of the organic molecules as the samples were being heated, thus giving misleading results. The Phoenix Mars lander[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html] discovered perchlorates in the Martian soil near the north pole in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam’s ovens are hotter than the ones on the Vikings and should destroy the perchlorates before they destroy the organics, said Paul R. Mahaffy, the principal investigator of the Sam instrument. In addition, nine of the cups include a chemical solvent that would allow analysis at lower temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam will also analyze the atmosphere, possibly confirming controversial claims that it contains methane. Methane, broken apart by sunlight and chemical reactions, lasts only a few centuries. If there is methane in Mars’s atmosphere, something must be making it — perhaps microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main mission is scheduled to last two years. Then again, the last two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed for only three months of exploration. Spirit lasted six years, and Opportunity is still rolling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the earlier rovers, Curiosity is powered by plutonium, generating electricity from the heat of radioactive decay. It is the same type of power supply that the two Voyager spacecraft traveling at the distant reaches of the solar system have been running on for nearly 35 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity lands successfully, it, too, could operate for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m on the edge of my seat,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “I’m not going to sit back until it’s safely on Mars.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, Calif. -- The future of NASA's exploration of Mars now comes down to a struggle between gravity and a half-million lines of computer code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently snug in an interplanetary spacecraft, the plutonium-powered rover called Curiosity will end its eight-and-a-half-month journey from Earth on Sunday, plowing into the Martian atmosphere at 13,000 miles per hour in a burst of fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that happens, control over the $2.5 billion mission will transfer to the onboard computer, which must slow the car-sized Curiosity and execute a series of intricate maneuvers to lower it to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of a 14-minute communications gap between the two planets, scientists on Earth will be mere spectators. Landing was scheduled to occur at 10:31 p.m. Sunday here in Pasadena, though officials warned that confirmation of a successful touchdown could take several hours or even days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failure could set back American-led Mars explorations for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of tightening budgets, NASA has already pulled out of collaborations with the European Space Agency planned for 2016 and 2018. The space agency is now contemplating what alternative missions it can fly on its own to Mars in 2018 -- but nothing nearly as ambitious or expensive as Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity fails, NASA would have to start over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug McCuistion, the Mars exploration program director, said NASA would persist as it had following earlier Mars failures. After the loss of two Mars spacecraft in 1999, NASA then built and landed two highly successful rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off,'' Mr. McCuistion said at a news conference on Saturday. ''This will not be the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At landing time, two NASA craft, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey, will be passing close overhead, with Odyssey relaying transmissions to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the landing could pass without word from Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't necessarily mean something bad has happened,'' said Richard Cook, the deputy project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the landing succeeds, the first black-and-white photographs could be beamed back on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the first week, Curiosity is to deploy its main antenna, raise a mast containing cameras, a rock-vaporizing laser and other instruments, and take its first 360-degree panorama shot of its surroundings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will spend the first month checking out Curiosity. Mr. Cook said the first drive could occur early next month. The rover would not scoop its first sample of Martian soil until mid-September at the earliest, and the first drilling into rock would occur in October or November, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Curiosity rover has landed on Mars and sent back a picture of its nuclear power pack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover's first grainy photo, from a "hazcam" at the rear of the rover that will be used to limit risks, shows the left rear wheel, a little bit of soil and a cooling fin from the rover's radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The generator is the only power source for the one-ton rover, which is supposed to cruise the surface for 23 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, used solar panels. But those were sometimes covered with dust, and the rovers ran short of power, especially on short days in the Martian winter. NASA decided that solar power was not suitable[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/the-competition-between-solar-and-nuclear-energy-moves-to-mars/] for the larger Curiosity, so the vehicle makes electricity from heat that is generated by the radioactive decay of plutonium 238.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian booster rocket carrying two telecommunications satellites malfunctioned during a launching early Tuesday, failing to deliver the satellites into their proper orbit and rendering them useless and unsalvageable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mishap was another blow to Russia's space program, which has been plagued by malfunctions, crashes and failed launchings. The failure was particularly glaring because it came just hours after NASA's successful landing of a research probe on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging the starkly different outcomes, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri O. Rogozin, who oversees Russia's military industry, suggested in a Twitter post that the national space agency, Roscosmos, was struggling because of aging leadership. ''As long as the youngest Roscosmos director is 62, we can only dream of Mars rovers,'' Mr. Rogozin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause of the failure is under investigation, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellites, worth about $45 million, were intended to provide telecommunications services for Indonesian and Russian customers. They were carried by a Proton rocket, with a Briz-M booster, launched from Russia's Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the launching, the Briz-M booster activated as scheduled but switched off after only seven seconds instead of the more than 18 minutes needed to propel the satellites into the proper orbit, Roscosmos said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booster and the two satellites have ''not been detected on the transition orbit,'' the space agency said, but rather ''from the interim emergency orbit,'' indicating a failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Roscosmos spokesman said that space experts worldwide would monitor the lost satellites and that at least for the moment, they posed no danger to the International Space Station. ''We have many years of successful experience in ensuring the safety of the station,'' the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar malfunction with the Briz-M booster last August resulted in the loss of another communications satellite, which floated in space until March, when Russian scientists redirected it into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aleksandr Zheleznyakov, a scientist with the Federation of Russian Cosmonautics, said the latest mishap was ''a considerable blow to the industry's image, particularly taking into account our many setbacks in the last couple of years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the lost satellites, called the Telekom-3, was the first Russian-made satellite bought by Indonesia. In May, a Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner crashed in Indonesia during a demonstration flight for potential buyers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- NASA's newest marvel, a one-ton rover named Curiosity, has been set down with all the delicacy of a carton of eggs on the surface of Mars. The perfect landing came after a complex series of automated maneuvers that had been tagged the ''seven minutes of terror,'' but that in the end were executed so flawlessly as to render the mission's Earthly handlers speechless with relief. There wasn't even a single error to report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On such evidence it could easily seem that planetary exploration is in the full bloom of vigorous good health under American leadership, thank you very much. There's little doubt that during the last decade the genre of robotic space exploration has reached an apex of achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, an apex already implies a fall, and the Obama administration's proposed NASA budget for 2013 seemingly wants to make that fall as immediate as possible, chopping $300 million from the agency's planetary science division -- a whopping 20 percent cut from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If such an evisceration is allowed to stand, the most cost-effective and successful division of NASA -- the very part of the agency that is actually exploring space with relatively economical robots, rather than flying astronauts expensively in the endless circularity of low Earth orbit -- will be reduced to a ghost of its former self. Curiosity could well be a swan song: NASA's final flagship interplanetary mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such cuts will also assure the demise of a fully elaborated and streamlined national infrastructure, one that knits together engineering talent, scientific expertise, technological innovation, spaceflight management, and communications systems that span the entire Solar System. This apparatus took five decades to build and constitutes one of the great achievements of our time. If it is allowed to come crashing down, it will be virtually impossible to replace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to be clear, these are the people and institutions that have produced some of the most cost-effective and powerful technologies ever conceived by the United States. Over the last five decades, NASA Planetary Science Division Voyagers and Vikings, its Magellan Venus radar mapper and Galileo Jupiter mission, its still-active Cassini Saturn orbiter and its ridiculously hardy Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity have opened up the entire Solar System to human eyes. Brought to us in scrupulous detail, a dazzling series of worlds and their moons have enlarged our collective sense of our location within space and time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's set aside the glories of discovery for the moment and look at space exploration's realpolitik. What do we get out of it, in concrete terms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, the money spent to achieve the exploration of the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn is money spent on Earth, not anywhere else. It powers innovative companies and develops technologies that inevitably -- and demonstrably -- benefit our economy and our national prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we go back all the way to the Apollo era, we'll soon see that it's no accident that each of us has the equivalent of a flawlessly miniaturized Mission Control on our digital desktops, with rows of icons standing in for Houston's rows of technicians seated at telemetry monitors, and each icon signifying a software application ready to do our bidding at a click.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our sublimely networked information-based civilization would have been inconceivable without the immense number of technological innovations spurred by NASA's push to land on the Moon. There would've been no Apple without Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this fruitful spillover of software and hardware innovation has cascaded forth from NASA programs ever since, irrigating Silicon Valley, among other places. Remarkably, even near-failures by the space agency have resulted in positive spin-off technologies that in turn have led directly to meaningful, tangible civilian applications capable of propelling economic progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the failure of NASA's Galileo orbiter to open its crucial high-gain antenna while en-route to Jupiter in 1990 resulted in a NASA-wide crash program intended to rescue the mission. The problem was that the spacecraft's underpowered omni-directional antenna, which had been intended for use only while Galileo was near Earth, was now the only way to receive data from a spacecraft more than 576 million miles away -- the greatest distance of Jupiter from Earth. And that antenna only had the feeble power of a 20 watt bulb, radiating energy wastefully in every direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeterred, NASA engineers devised an ingenious series of IT fixes, many of which involved developing or refining techniques for compressing and transmitting data through the keyhole of that impossibly faint signal. The result is that to this day, every time you send large documents across the Internet, or for that matter attach feather-light JPEG pictures to an e-mail and send them to a friend, you're directly benefiting from NASA research triggered by Galileo's antenna failure. (Meanwhile the mission itself was transformed from certain failure to remarkable success.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other wholly pragmatic reasons exist to pursue a vigorous program of interplanetary space exploration. These range from the utility of understanding the climatological stories of our neighboring terrestrial planets Venus and Mars (one of which swelters under a runaway greenhouse effect enforced by its dense atmosphere, with the other being a frigid desert world), to the usefulness of investigating the geology of near-Earth asteroids, and thus how they could potentially best be deflected from Earth-intersecting, and potentially civilization-ending, trajectories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally it bears repeating that in its entirety, meaning including human spaceflight and all its other divisions, NASA costs less than half of one percent of the federal budget -- a fraction of a penny on every tax dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the steady stream of high tech innovations that has streamed forth from the agency for decades, enriching our lives and bolstering our economy, the successful landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars should be an occasion not just to celebrate an astonishingly cool civilizational achievement, but also to renew our national commitment to the peaceful exploration of outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can start by restoring funding to the agency's prodigiously dynamic and successful interplanetary explorations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Benson is the author of ''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes'' and ''Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle.'' His new book of Solar System landscape photography, ''Planetfall,'' will be published in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover Curiosity survived its famed "seven minutes of terror" and has touched down on the surface of Mars, and the world cheered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting people to the Red Planet hasn't been a success story, however. "Landing humans on Mars has been 20 or 30 years away for the last 40 years or so," the rover driver Scott Maxwell at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian magazine this month[http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/Mars-Journal-162924526.html]. He acknowledged that there has not been the "political will" to take on such an expensive and risky project. But, he added, "All I know for sure is, if they'd put me on a rocket, I'd go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneur Elon Musk, whose NASA-supported private company launched a craft in May that successfully docked[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/science/space/space-x-capsule-docks-at-space-station.html] with the International Space Station, has said that his real goal is to send people to Mars in 15 or 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until any of that happens, we poor humans have to sit here and wait for our chance. A group of would-be explorers at the Mars Society[http://www.marssociety.org] has decided not to wait for rockets to get them to the Red Planet. The society, founded by Robert Zubrin, an advocate of planetary exploration, has created field research stations in difficult Earth environments that the group says create conditions like those found on Mars. One is in the Utah desert, another in the Arctic reaches of northern Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teams travel to the sites - known within the society as "habs," for habitations - for weeks or months at a time, to serve as "an effective testbed for field operations studies in preparation for human missions to Mars." They see themselves[http://mdrs.marssociety.org/home/goals] as testing the design features of the habitat, use of tools and technologies in hostile environments, and even work out the human factors that might affect people over a long mission with no way to get away from one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nadav Neuhaus[http://www.nadavneuhaus.com/], an Israeli-born photographer who lives in Jersey City, has spent time with teams at both of those sites. When he first heard about the <span class="companylink">Mars Society</span> and its attempt to simulate living on Mars, "I said, 'Wow, this is strange,' " he recalled. As he got to know people who embarked upon the arduous, isolated missions - some for months on end - he found them "super, super serious" about paving the way for future explorers, as one man in his 80s put it. "He told me 'I will never step on Mars, but I did this first, small step.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Israel, Mr. Neuhaus, worked for the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, and later for Sygma, then for Agence France-Presse covering Gaza. He moved to the United States in 2005 and has since covered the earthquake in Haiti, last year's uprising in Egypt and the illegal immigration along the United States-Mexico border. Mr. Neuhaus, 40, also produced a multimedia piece[http://vimeo.com/m/26599278] on rape in the camps in Haiti that was named a PDN Photo Annual selection for 2012.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for our favorite this week, we chose Danielle, NYC, age 13[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week-13/?apage=2#comment-649025], who wrote about a staged drowning and a Long Island family in turmoil. "The fact that this article even has to exist pains me," she writes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week in The Times, the article, "Long Island Man Faked His Own Death, Wife Says"[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/nyregion/wife-says-long-island-man-once-feared-drowned-faked-his-death.html] caught my attention. Raymond Roth, a 47-year-old man was thought to have drowned at Jones Beach - according to his 22-year-old son, Jonathan. The police and other agencies conducted a full-fledged air, water and land search for him. His wife, Evana even started arranging a funeral, until she found e-mails exchanged by Raymond and his son (her stepson).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that he'd planned this whole fake death with Jonathan and was found (alive) in South Carolina, driving down a highway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that this article even has to exist pains me. The fact that this sort of thing isn't terribly uncommon is worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all started with two people falling in love - they had to, in order to say "I do." Eventually, the whole "We're a Happy Family" scenario was crushed when Mr. Man-of-the-House was fired from work after threatening to kill supervisors of his. Evana says she suffered mental abuse from Raymond, who was an alcoholic. The thing is, Evana and Raymond were married for over a decade. Obviously, their marriage wasn't healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know if any marriage is healthy. It seems like humans are unable to completely dedicate themselves to another person. Feeling that ultimate "it" (lust? love?) and then signing a bunch of papers won't guarantee that you'll never get bored. Eventually that spark will fizzle out and the "magic couple" will be trapped in the same, drab routine decided by stupid mistakes. Every last drop of divine affection has probably been squeezed out by then. It's like when you hear a song for the first time and love it, but then hear it again a million times and realize that it's not that great and just one song, out of trillions, and there's probably some other song that's better, making it not special anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Evana and Raymond can't love each other with the same burning passion they did twelve years ago, trying to fade away from what they were stuck with must be way easier.</p>
