<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What ever happened to the Goldilocks planet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was big news back in September 2010 when a group led by Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and R. Paul Butler of the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> said they had discovered a small planet circling a small red star in the constellation Libra, at a distance smack in the middle of the so-called Goldilocks zone -- that ''just right'' region where water on the surface is possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed, Gliese 581g, as it is known, would be the first known exoplanet -- that is, a planet outside our own solar system -- that could support life. But within weeks, a group of exoplanet astronomers based at the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland under the leadership of Michel Mayor said they could not find the planet in their own extensive data on the star. After other papers appeared questioning the statistical significance of the new planet, most astronomers consigned it to the bin of failed dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, however, Dr. Vogt and Dr. Butler struck back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper in the journal Astronomische Nachrichten (Astronomical Notes) they argued that the planet does indeed show up in the Swiss observations, if they are analyzed properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see the planet in their data,'' Dr. Butler said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new paper has raised eyebrows, but has so far changed few minds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail recently, Dr. Vogt said, ''The silence is telling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical was the response from Artie P. Hatzes, a former student of Dr. Vogt's who is now at the Thuringian State Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany, who said it pained him to see his old mentor sticking to a conclusion ''that is obviously wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hatzes called Gliese 581g ''a marginal detection'' that was not supported by additional data, something that happens often. ''I think that no amount of fancy analysis can replace having high-quality data and more of it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impasse has led some astronomers to suggest that an outsider look at the data, but everyone is too busy with his or her own research. In the two years since Gliese 581g (pronounced GLEE-za) was announced, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Kepler satellite has identified more than 2,300 candidate planets in a small portion of the Milky Way in the Cygnus constellation, which scientists are sifting in hopes of soon discovering what some call Earth 2.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing else, the dispute illustrates just how hard it is to find out what is going on only a short distance away in the universe. The star Gliese 581 is about 20 light-years away, next door in cosmic terms. The evidence for its planets comes from slight periodic variations in the star's velocity, caused by gravitational tugs of planets swirling around it. The heavier the planet and the closer it is to its star, the bigger the tug, so it can take years to build up and parse the data for an entire system -- the so-called wobble method.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was on this basis, using sensitive spectrography that goes by the acronym Harps on a telescope in Chile, that the Geneva team concluded by 2007 that there were four planets circling the star, two of them on either side of the ''habitable zone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, Dr. Vogt and his colleagues added two more planets based on their own observations with the Keck telescope in Hawaii, including the one in the middle of the habitable zone, circling the star every 37 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European astronomers were quick to say the new planet was not in their own data. But much to the annoyance of Dr. Vogt and his colleagues, that data was not made public for a year, in a paper posted to the Internet by Thierry Forveille of the Grenoble Observatory in France, the lead author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Forveille and his colleagues concluded that their data were best fit by a model in which Gliese 581 had four planets, one of which had an elongated elliptical orbit of 69 days. Such a planet could masquerade as one with half that orbital period, they said, perhaps explaining Dr. Vogt's planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Vogt and his colleagues contend that such an arrangement would be unstable, leading to colliding planets within 200,000 years. Redoing the analysis and assuming that the orbits were all circular, they found leftover data points that could be explained by a fifth planet with an orbit of about 32 days, snugly in the habitable zone, and a mass slightly more than twice that of Earth, essentially confirming their original Goldilocks claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting this new study published was a tricky problem. Because the Forveille data had not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, Dr. Vogt was not able to publish his analysis of that data in The Astrophysical Journal, the journal of choice for American astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they sent it to Astronomische Nachrichten, one of the oldest astronomy journals in the world, but rarely the venue today for groundbreaking news. ''So we will now publish their own data for them for all the world to see and analyze, and then judge for themselves whether the Swiss's rebuttal claims have any credibility,'' Dr. Vogt wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail, Dr. Forveille shrugged off the new report, writing that his own team's computer simulations showed that the planetary system with elliptical orbits was stable at least over 900,000 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More to the point, he and other astronomers said, was that Dr. Vogt's planet had a 4 percent chance of being a false alarm. That is far above the 1 percent chance normally considered a benchmark for planet detection, and much bigger than the margin Dr. Vogt and his colleagues had cited in their first paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Increasing false alarm probabilities with more data is of course never a good sign,'' Dr. Forveille said. Greg Laughlin of the University of California, Santa Cruz, an expert on planetary dynamics, said the chances of a false alarm rise to 12 percent when uncertainties about the star Gliese 581 itself -- stellar noise -- are added in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, Dr. Vogt still had ''a decent shot''of being right. It comes down to whether four planets with eccentric orbits or five planets with circular ones are a more economical fit to the data. Assuming that the planets' orbits all lie in the same plane, Dr. Laughlin explained, tips the balance toward the extra planet. But, of course, more data is needed. He said, ''I thus believe that it is likely that if the peak holds up as more data comes in, the planetary explanation is likely to be correct.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Ford, an astronomer at the University of Florida who is involved with Kepler, noted that Carl Sagan had maintained that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my judgment,'' Dr. Ford said, ''we do not have extraordinary evidence for the claimed planet Gliese 581g, at least not yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hatzes agreed, but added, ''I am sure this will not be the last we have heard of GL 581g.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a modest test drive: moving forward 15 feet, turning in place 120 degrees, then backing up about 8 feet. The entire trip took about 16 minutes, with most of the time spent stopped as cameras took photographs of the progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the team behind Curiosity, the six-wheeled NASA rover that landed on Mars 17 days ago, the first tracks in the dust on Wednesday were an exciting milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It couldn't be more important,'' Peter C. Theisinger, the mission's project manager, said at a post-drive news conference. ''I mean, we built a rover. So unless the rover roves, we really haven't accomplished anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity is to spend at least a couple of years roving through a 96-mile-wide crater and up a 3.4-mile-high mountain at the center of the crater, exploring for signs that early Mars could have been habitable for microbial life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that journey of miles started with a roll of a few feet away from Bradbury Landing, where Curiosity set down on Aug. 6. NASA said on Wednesday that the spot had been named for Ray Bradbury, the author of ''The Martian Chronicles'' and other influential science-fiction novels, who died in June. He would have turned 92 on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Curiosity has been busy with other exercises, like vaporizing Martian rocks and seeing what they are made of (basalt, apparently, or something similar). On Sunday, the rover fired a laser instrument for the first time, hitting a rock with 30 bursts in 10 seconds and analyzing the atomic makeup from the resulting flashes of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, it flexed its arm. On Tuesday, it wiggled its four corner wheels in preparation for the drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything has been going extremely well,'' Mr. Theisinger said. ''Really extremely well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having succeeded at rock-zapping on Sunday, scientists turned the laser, which was developed at <span class="companylink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span>, to vaporize small bits at six more locations. So far, most of the rocks appear to be a type, common on Mars, that forms from the rapid cooling of lava.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another instrument, provided by Russia, has started firing neutrons into the soil to look for hydrogen, which would point to the presence of water. The rover has also gradually started science observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the only broken piece has been a wind sensor that may have been knocked out by rocks kicked up during the landing, NASA said. A second wind sensor is working properly, as is the rest of the rover's weather station, which was contributed by Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station has measured swings in air temperature from minus-103 degrees to 28 degrees Fahrenheit. Swings in ground temperatures have been even greater, from minus-132 degrees to 37 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the next week, as more instruments are checked out, Curiosity may conduct its first analysis of the makeup of the Martian atmosphere. When that is complete, it is to head to its first destination, called Glenelg, where three types of terrain appear to intersect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Curiosity will move only about 30 feet at a time. As its engineers gain experience, the drives will stretch to longer than the length of a football field, relying on the rover's ability to navigate for itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Theisinger, the project manager, cautioned that the early successes did not ensure future ones; so far, the mission has checked off only two of its primary goals, to launch on time and to land on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a long way to go before this mission meets its full potential,'' he said. ''But the fact we haven't had any early problem is, in fact, fantastic.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANDREW C. REVKIN   </div><div>655 words</div><div>25 August 2012</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was saddened to learn today of the death of NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/science/space/neil-armstrong-dies-first-man-on-moon.html], whose “one small step” so fixated my generation (I was born in 1956). The video above provides an unusual split-screen view of Armstrong’s hop from the lunar module landing gear to the dusty lunar surface (much more footage and background is here[http://j.mp/apolloelevenfootage]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apollo missions were utterly captivating for young science buffs like me (and my brother, whose room often smelled of glue as he assembled detailed spacecraft models). To review that era, start with the great “Mission to the Moon[http://www.nytimes.com//interactive/2009/07/13/science/20090714-apollo11-interactive.html]” interactive video feature produced by The Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I’ve interviewed all kinds of luminaries in 30 years as a journalist, I still feel a particular sense of honor when I call up Rusty Schweickart[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/schweickart-rl.html], an Apollo 9 astronaut whose prime concern these days is helping humans develop the capacity to detect and deflect asteroids[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/?s=schweickart] that might hit the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s easy to forget that for young people these days, the space race is somewhat mysterious, particularly now that manned missions beyond Earth orbit are a thing of the past — at least for the time being. By chance, just yesterday my 14-year-old son, Jack, asked me a powerful and important question about the moon missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was flipping through “Paper Astronaut: The Paper Spacecraft Mission Manual[http://www.amazon.com/Paper-Astronaut-Spacecraft-Mission-Manual/dp/0789318814]” and asked: “Would we have gone to the Moon if there hadn’t been a cold war?” My gut answer was “no.” But today I did a bit of homework and here’s what I found:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tapes and transcripts released last year by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library provide some detail on the political and geopolitical context, as summarized here by About.com[http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa083001a.htm]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently released audio recordings from the Kennedy White House reveal that politics, more than science, may have fueled America’s race to the moon against the Soviets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 73-minute tape, recently released by the John F. Kennedy Library, records a meeting between President Kennedy, NASA Administrator James Webb, Vice President Lyndon Johnson and others in the Cabinet Room of the White House on November 21, 1962.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussion reveals a president who felt landing men on the moon should be <span class="companylink">NASA</span>’s top priority and a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> chief who did not. When asked by Kennedy if he considered the moon landing to be <span class="companylink">NASA</span>’s top priority, Webb responded, “No sir, I do not. I think it is one of the top priority programs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kennedy then urges Webb to adjust his priorities because, “This is important for political reasons, international political reasons. This is, whether we like it or not, an intensive race.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worlds of politics and science were suddenly at odds. Webb told Kennedy that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists still had grave doubts about the survivability of a moon landing. “We don’t know anything about the surface of the moon,” he states, going on to suggest that only through a careful, comprehensive and scientific approach to manned exploration could the U.S. gain “pre-eminence in space.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More excerpts can be read at the presidential library Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also read Bill Broad’s 2007 feature in a special Science Times section on the 50th anniversary of Sputnik[http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2007/09/24/science/space/index.html], “From the Start, the Space Race Was an Arms Race[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/science/space/25mili.html].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reviewing this and other background, I’d stick with my gut hunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This doesn’t take away from the breathtaking nature of the Apollo astronauts’ achievements and our species’ other activities on the edge of the possible. And the cold war produced a host of incredible breakthroughs in other areas of science and technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it does reinforce the picture of a species that, for the most part, doesn’t undertake dramatic, sustained and costly ventures without a near-term, practical imperative at the root.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>344 words</div><div>28 August 2012</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first-ever planet-to-planet music broadcast, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>’s Mars rover, Curiosity, beamed a new song by Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas to Earth on Tuesday, playing an mp3 file to an audience of engineers and students at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena[http://www.csmonitor.com/tags/topic/NASA+Jet+Propulsion+Laboratory], Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why do they say the sky is the limit when I’ve seen the footprints on the moon?” Will.i.am sings in the song, “Reach for the Stars[https://play.google.com/store/music/album/will_i_am_Reach_For_The_Stars_Mars_Edition?id=Byc4ttzyjswierkki7tnrytktoy&amp;feature=artist-albums#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDYwMiwiYWxidW0tQnljNHR0enlqc3dpZXJra2k3dG5yeXRrdG95Il0],” which made its solar system premiere after a 330-million-mile trip, from Earth to Mars and back again. (Alas, any nearby Martians were out of luck: the rover does not have speakers to broadcast music to its surrounding landscape, and the thin Martian air would have distorted the sound.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The song debut, part of Will.i.am’s efforts to cheerlead for science and mathematics education, did not require any advances in space technology, but perhaps reflected a more media-savvy approach by the space agency in making its work seem glamorous. The singer was among a parade of celebrities who descended on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Aug. 5 to watch Curiosity, an automobile-sized mobile science laboratory, touch down on Mars; others included the actor Morgan Freeman, the director Barry Sonnenfeld, the comedian Seth Green and the actress Nichelle Nichols (who played Lt. Uhura on the original Star Trek).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is not the first time that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has dabbled in music from outer space. The radio emissions of Saturn, recorded by the Cassini spacecraft, were shifted into audible frequencies, and the Kronos Quartet then incorporated the space sounds into a composition called “Sun Rings.” In 2008, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Beatles song [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/us/01brfs-ACROSSTHEUNI_BRF.html] “Across the Universe” by transmitting it into deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the galaxy appears ungrateful. “Obviously, deep space hasn’t sent us anything back,” a NASA spokeswoman noted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norfolk, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOST technological advances are actually just improvements. One thing builds on the next: from shoddy to serviceable, from helpful to amazing. First you had a carriage, then a car, and then an airplane; now you have a jet. You improve on what is there. Technological advances are like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for the one that involved landing on the Moon. When a human went and stood on the Moon and looked back at the Earth, that was a different kind of breakthrough. Nothing tangible changed when Neil Armstrong's foot dug into the lunar dust and his eyes turned back at us. We didn't get faster wheels or smaller machines or more effective medicine. But we changed, fundamentally. What had been unknown, was known. What had been unseen was seen. And our human horizon popped out 200,000 miles. Forever, we would see the Earth differently, because we had seen it from someplace truly foreign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why Mars is important. When we get a human to Mars -- in the next few decades, NASA has predicted -- our horizon will expand 1,000 times farther, and it will never go back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching the first images from the rover, Curiosity, which landed on Mars early this month, I was reminded of a short story by Ray Bradbury called ''Mars Is Heaven!'' In it, Mars is populated by aliens who fool visiting Earthlings into thinking they're in a familiar environment before murdering them. It's about how stupid nostalgia is, how it tricks us into wanting things that were never that great in the first place. What strikes me about the story is that, just over 60 years ago, someone could seriously write about aliens on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you imagine what it was like then? Mars was an impossible frontier; we wouldn't even have decent pictures of the planet until almost 20 years after the story was published. Now it reads like a fairy tale in which the moon is made of cheese, or the sun is a horse-drawn chariot bearing a god, or the stars move in crystal spheres around the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When humanity was in its infancy, we thought the universe revolved around us. Then, with Copernicus, we aged into heliocentrism, became aware we were one of a family of planets inside the walls of our house, the solar system. Nearby stars gather like a town, rotating through the galaxy, our country. Clusters are like continents. We realized in stages that we were very insignificant. And then, almost like grown-ups, we pulled our boots on and began to try to leave a significant mark anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't get anywhere by staying home from Mars. By pushing our little mine carts around the earth and making speedier mine carts, by connecting long pipes to communicate with one another and then creating better pipes to shout down, louder ways to shout. All of our squabbles with other humans and all of our possessions here on earth, the things we make faster, easier, smaller, really mean very little. How could they, when the universe is so big? Significance is in science -- not the science that leads to better mine carts and more efficient shouting, but the science that leads to more ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember Plato's allegory of the cave. In the cave, the people look at shadows moving on the wall. They watch the shadows move, and they think that's living. What if they could go outside and see the sun? That's us, moving from the Earth to the Moon. That's Neil Armstrong, who died at the age of 82 over the weekend, standing on the Moon, and looking back at Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing about the cave is, it's not just one cave. It's more caves, and more, all nested within one another. The Moon was our first cave; Mars will be next. And then there will be another cave, and another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people scoff at sending humans to Mars, and say that pictures of wheel marks on a red desert are not worth the trouble when there are so many things here at home that we could be spending money on, it makes me claustrophobic. It's as if we're trying, out of guilt or shame, to crawl back into the cave and watch the shadows on the wall. We're trying to stay children in our parents' house, knowing that the road leads to town, and then to another town. We're saying, ''Look, we made a really great toilet that flushes itself! Remember that printing press? That was pretty neat. We even made pyramids -- those things are huge! Can't we just be happy with making a great toilet even greater? Do we really have to go to Mars?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mars is waiting. It spins now outside our human reach. We must realize that the work of growing up is not something we can cut when the budget gets tight. It is mission critical, for the intellectual life of the species, for the future of humans, not to stagnate, not to wither, but to stretch, and reach, and always to expand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DELHI&nbsp; - Let's send a mission to Mars[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article3775271.ece], Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a couple of weeks ago, just as his government was fending off corruption charges and the country was still recovering from the biggest blackout since the invention of electricity[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/world/asia/power-outages-hit-600-million-in-india.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Singh's $77 million plan did nothing to divert attention from his administration's failings, it did focus some unfortunate attention on India's space program, suggesting that what had been a fine endeavor to date has now been hitched to India's dream of becoming a great power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its creation in the 1960s, the program has had a reasonably successful record of placing communications, earth-mapping and meteorological satellites [pdf[http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/article_42136.pdf]] in orbit around the Earth. For all the carping about such missions' cost, especially given the poverty in India, they seem to have paid for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ambition of a Mars mission goes well beyond practical applications. It's about basic science research and planetary exploration, as well as a very real, and ludicrous, race to space with China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site of the Indian Space Research Organization[http://www.isro.org/scripts/Aboutus.aspx], the Indian equivalent of NASA, greets visitors with the face of Vikram Sarabhai, the founder of India's space program, and this quote, "We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight. But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the comity of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flaunting this is in keeping with the Indian habit of placing some people on a pedestal while ignoring what they actually say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's still unclear what to make of India's moves beyond the Sarabhai mandate so far. With Chandrayaan-1, India's $90 million 2008-9 mission to the Moon[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/world/asia/22indiamoon.html], it succeeded in landing an unmanned probe[http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/15/stories/2008111550580100.htm], but technical failures reduced the mission's lifetime from two years to 312 days[http://www.isro.org/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Aug29_2009]. Hard questions about its shortcomings were evaded thanks to the success of NASA's mineralogy mapping instrument, which was on board the Indian probe and provided evidence of water[http://www.hindu.com/2009/09/23/stories/2009092357770100.htm] on the moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The objective of India's latest mission is not to land on Mars - with NASA's rover missions there that would be redundant - but to place a satellite in an elliptical orbit around the planet in order to identify the geological source of the methane that has &nbsp;been detected in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A worthy scientific objective? Perhaps. But India's mission to Mars seems to have been planned in a hurry, and by default. Until recently I.S.R.O. had been focused on another Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2, but repeated failures of its latest rocket have led to delays[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-04-26/news/31410283_1_cryogenic-engine-moon-mission-gslv-rocket]. The Mars mission was supposed to fill the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was also announced just months after the failure of a Chinese mission[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-01/20/content_14479167.htm] with a remarkably similar aim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the first time India has tried &nbsp;to score points over China. Chandrayaan-1's landing on the Moon in the autumn of 2008 -- just one month after a Chinese astronaut performed a space walk[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/world/asia/28china.html] - was touted as an achievement the Chinese had yet to match[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1852608,00.html]. Since then Indian scientists have announced plans to put men in low orbit around the Earth by 2016 and on the Moon by 2020[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/4788143/India-to-spend-1.7bn-sending-man-to-the-moon.html] - five years before the Chinese[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/dec/30/china-manned-moon-mission-lunar] are planning their own Moon walk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind that the Americans managed the feat almost half a century ago, Beijing and Delhi both foresee a 21st century very different from the 20th. Scientists in India are already talking about mineral exploitation and colonization on the Moon[http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/28/stories/2010012854451100.htm]. It's such hopes that suggest the real problem with the Mars mission: that its stated aims mask a grandiose ambition.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Kumar[http://www.alexanderkumar.com/], a physician and researcher at Concordia Station, writes from Antarctica, where he conducts scientific experiments for the European Space Agency's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you want to be an astronaut? Well, have you ever considered becoming a "hivernaut" instead? Hivernaut is the term used to describe those who overwinter at Dome Charlie in Antarctica, one of the most isolated and extreme environments on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am currently working at Concordia Station -- a remote manned research outpost that is jointly run by the French Polar Institute and the Italian Antarctic Program, located at Dome Charlie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My work for the European Space Agency is on human spaceflight research, and you would be right to think that it includes overcoming gravity and rapid travel to the other side of the atmosphere. But it also includes research in environments analogous to space, where lessons can be learned for a fraction of the cost -- financially and to the environment -- and with considerably less risk to those involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space-analogue environment, whether naturally occurring or created,&nbsp; is a site that, for the purpose of research, mimics aspects of the challenges involved in space travel or life on the surface of other planets or moons. The sites can include vehicles and habitats, and range from planetary analogue test sites to reduced-gravity environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing that no analogue environment on Earth can truly replicate are the conditions found in space, notably zero gravity. I am writing while living within such an analogue environment, and my glass of water, laptop and desk stationery remain, thankfully, well secured by Earth's gravitational pull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while my physical state remains comparatively stable and secure here, living in such isolation at this extreme can affect my psychological well-being, taking it through its own elliptical and precarious orbit through the Antarctic darkness - an important aspect of this kind of research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been many analogue projects in the past, and more are planned for the future to test elements such as technology to the human factors of psychology and physiology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, NASA has expanded its human spaceflight and robotic exploration beyond low Earth orbit, preparing for its next missions by first conducting research on Earth using analogue environments. Overseen by its Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, it includes the management of commercial space transportation, exploration systems development, human spaceflight capabilities, advanced exploration systems, and space life sciences research and applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently NASA's Extreme Environment Mission Operations (Neemo) underwater program, using the Aquarius habitat, reached its end. From deep in the Antarctic winter darkness, I had exchanged images with the European Space Agency's British astronaut-in-training, Tim Peake, who was living 20 meters (about 65 feet) underwater and conducting extra-vehicular research in Neemo's low-gravity environment for possible future asteroid exploration. Looking at the daylight streaming into the depths of the temperate waters in his photos, I realized how different and faraway we were, though testing similar elements of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies program, in the Arizona desert, tested hardware like Rover prototypes and experimented with sample-collection techniques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the polar regions have been used as extreme and reliable study environments - a sort of "Mars on ice." <span class="companylink">The Mars Society</span> established a Mars Analogue Research Station, and its first project was the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island in Nunavut, Canada's northernmost territory, an area where I have lived and worked. Its second project, Mars Desert Research Station, is in the southern Utah desert. A NASA-financed expedition -- Arctic Mars Analog Svalbard Expedition&nbsp; -- is also based in the Arctic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the projects focused on developing and testing planetary exploration technology and equipment, including prototypes for space suits, life systems and rovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, having identified features in the Moroccan desert in the northern Sahara near Erfoud that share qualities with the surface of Mars, the Austrian Space Forum and PolAres Research Program will conduct the integrated MARS2013 Mars Analog Field Simulation[http://www.oewf.org/cms/index.php?mars2013] to test equipment, communications and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in 2013, Cornell University, in partnership with the University of Hawaii, will commence the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation[http://manoa.hawaii.edu/hi-seas/], known as Hi-Seas, in which a six-member crew will live in a simulated Mars habitat for 120 days conducting research, including on new forms of food and food preparation strategies for long-term space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most famous and useful studies seeking to understand the psychological implications of long-duration spaceflight has been the European Space Agency's Mars 500 mission, in collaboration with the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a multinational crew of six who spent 520 days in complete isolation, confined to working and living inside a module, the project included a simulated (successful) mission from Earth to the surface of Mars. The project was limited, not only by its absence of zero gravity but also by its geographical location: located in Moscow, it provided a comfort blanket of sorts, with the crew members knowing that they could leave the module at any time should they wish to cancel their participation. As it turns out, no one did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recently spoke with a Mars 500 crew member, Romain Charles. He explained that the three main challenges for astronauts on a trip to Mars are the effects of weightlessness, radiation exposure and the human factor - the main element studied in the Mars 500 mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Charles said he could feel a real distance between the people working around the modules and the crew inside. Yet, he reported, in such confinement during the 520 days of isolation, there were no conflicts among the crew members, which was a surprise for the psychologists studying them. Granted, the crew was never in a life-threatening situation, but Mr. Charles said he was able to answer "yes" to the question "Is man able to endure the confinement of a trip to Mars?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every space-analogue environment is limited in what it can test and the reliability of the results it can provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, living at Concordia, the isolation is far different from the experience of the Mars 500 project. Here we are unreachable from February to November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concordia seems an ideal environment for studying true isolation, and is said to have similarities to long space travel (a one-way trip to Mars would also last about nine months). But in contrast to long space travel, at Concordia Station we live in a comparatively comfortable and spacious environment and can walk outside and breathe without space suits and airlocks or extravehicular activities protocol. That obviously affects perception of sensory deprivation, confinement and, ultimately, isolation. Hypoxia, a feature of living at Concordia, is also not experienced in space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To me, it is closer to simulating life in a colony on another planet or moon, perhaps closer to home than Mars, where our communications remain largely reliable, without delay, with the Internet, Skype, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter[https://twitter.com/DrAlexKumar] available to bridge the distance from home -- though this luxury can also be a teasing torture, causing crew members to miss home perhaps more than they would if they were fully cut off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any analogue environment research is also affected by who is involved. At Concordia, crew members are selected after basic physical and psychological screening, with little competition for the slots. Astronaut selection, on the other hand, is a heavily competitive, thorough, in-depth, well-guarded secret, with a proven recipe for success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extrapolation of results from experiments like ours is also limited by many others factors, including diet and and small sample sizes - for instance, 13 crew members are currently overwintering at Concordia. On the flip side, the more random selection of members of an Antarctic overwintering crew may be more representative of the entire standard distribution curve's spectrum. In this way it may better reflect and identify any internal biological changes potentially suffered by all or some human populations - astronauts or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Antarctic stations are just as isolated as Concordia and offer different experiences and opportunities for research, including Russia's Vostok station, America's Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and also, possibly, the <span class="companylink">British Antarctic Survey</span>'s Halley Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year there are more than 50 people overwintering at South Pole Station, where I regularly speak with the lone overwintering physician, a <span class="companylink">United States Navy</span> retiree, Dr. Dale Molé. Having spent a lifetime working on submarines, he understands life in confinement. Like me, he also shares a love of polar exploration and history, and so sought the challenge of enduring the Antarctic winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether the South Pole Station could be used as a space-analogue environment, he explained that it offers many qualities -- starting with a large sample size that could be four to five times greater than what is offered by other stations like Concordia (in research the more subjects you study, the more reliable the research is).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Molé explained how the South Pole bears some resemblance to a Mars mission. Besides its thin, arid atmospheres and extreme cold environment, it offers an austere, remote medical environment, where all water is frozen and there are no indigenous life forms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Molé further explained how the South Pole in winter is very similar to a submarine in everything but space and the presence of women. Aboard a submarine, life is pretty much confined to the elevated station. There is a monotony to the days. And submarines operate on a rotating watch schedule, so constant fatigue is a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the South Pole, the elevation and poor sleep hygiene can result in the "big eye," or insomnia (thus sleep studies are often incorporated into analogue studies).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only by collaborating and collating the results of the various projects can we test conditions, identify challenges and find solutions to succeed in future long space missions. Then, like a giant jigsaw puzzle, the results could be assembled to provide enough confidence to allow a manned mission to land on Mars (and return to Earth).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDGED between a strip-mall chiropractor and a cluster of optometrists in Rochester, N.Y., the offices of the DePrez Group of Travel Companies hardly seems like the kind of place where someone would begin a journey to the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Craig Curran, the company's president, says that's exactly where he can take you -- provided, of course, that you have a spare $200,000 lying around. Mr. Curran, you see, is a so-called ''accredited space agent'' for Virgin Galactic, an outfit founded by the multitasking mogul Richard Branson that is promising to take hundreds of high rollers some 60 miles up in a futuristic craft known as the SpaceShipTwo. And while the flight lasts only two hours or so, with a mere five minutes spent coasting in weightlessness, the bragging rights will go on forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you could say my family came over on the Niña, the Pinta or the Santa Maria, this is the equivalent,'' said Mr. Curran, wearing a black Virgin Galactic T-shirt and an enthusiastic smile. ''You are part of the birth of an industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic may be aloft as soon as next year, just one among a handful of companies competing to take amateur astronauts to the upper reaches of the atmosphere -- and beyond. In what may be the final frontier in extreme tourism, these outfits are offering experiences that range from a few moments of weightless wonder (most for six figures), to weeks-long Apollo mission-style adventures (for, gulp, nine). Forget climbing Everest, trekking to the South Pole or canoeing up the Amazon: How about taking a trip to the far side of the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's exactly the package being offered by Excalibur Almaz, based on the Isle of Man, which recently announced its intention to send people -- very, very wealthy people -- to a ''gravity neutral point'' near the moon for the ultimate get-away-from-it-all. The price: About $150 million. Wait, you're on a budget? O.K., well, for just $50 million, Space Adventures, in Virginia, says its can get you to the International Space Station, a trip seven people have already enjoyed that includes up to 12 days in orbit and, presumably, all the freeze-dried ice cream you can eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not crazy about the lodging options? Well, if you're willing to wait, the owner of the extended-stay hotel chain Budget Suites of America, Robert T. Bigelow, says that he plans to launch a variety of private space stations (nightly rate to be determined).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while some trips will be more readily available in the near term than others, scientists and players in the space race say that the long-fanciful idea of vacationing in space, if only for a few moments, is on the cusp of becoming reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no question, in the next couple of years there's going to be commercial space tourism,'' said Roger D. Launius, senior curator of space history at the National Air and Space Museum at the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian Institution</span>. ''That's clearly going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LAUNIUS and other experts say suborbital flights in reusable vehicles are more feasible than, for example, retracing the steps of the Apollo mission. And confidence is high that there is an appetite for even brief tastes of space: last month, the Tauri Group, a Washington-area consulting firm with a specialty in space issues, found a potential market of up to $1.6 billion over the next decade for suborbital flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In terms of an industry moving toward fruition, versus an industry that has a plan,'' said Carissa Christensen, managing partner of the Tauri Group, ''I think it has absolutely made that shift.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a variety of practical reasons for the sudden surge in activity. They include cheaper, better technology and composite materials, along with a burst of previously pent-up entrepreneurship let loose by NASA's new need for private companies to replace shuttle flights. For its part, NASA says it is ''counting on the innovative commercial space industry'' for rides to the space station and other low-orbit destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the desire for such trips may also lie in the fact that people are simply running out of places to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every square inch of Earth, pretty much, has been explored at this point by somebody,'' said Eugene Linden, a science and environmental writer and the author of ''The Ragged Edge of the World,'' about the planet's endangered wild lands. ''Next, we'll be hearing about roller-skating across the East Antarctic ice sheet or something like that in order to have some sense of accomplishment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linden also suggested that some of the lust for going to space may come from a primal animal drive to do something no one else can imitate -- something, he says, that is ''meant to show reproductive robustness on the part of the male.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linden added that while males ''can fake a lot of things -- you can rent a Ferrari for the weekend -- it's hard to fake going to outer space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, Virgin Galactic says 77 percent of its customers are male. And many of those leading the charge to the cosmos are deep-pocketed, ample-ego men like Mr. Branson, 62, who in addition to running the billion-dollar <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span> also recently became the oldest man to kite surf across the English Channel (really). And Virgin Galactic's own SpaceShipTwo happens to be based on a craft -- SpaceShipOne -- that was backed by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. (In 2004 SpaceShipOne became the first privately developed manned vehicle to reach space. It carried a single pilot; no tourists were allowed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's Elon Musk, the dashing chairman of Tesla Motors who founded the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> company, which develops rockets, who hopes to cart astronauts and cargo aloft. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also promises, according to a spokeswoman, to ultimately ''make life interplanetary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, meanwhile, has Blue Origin, a media-shy operation promising ''human access to space at dramatically lower cost and increased reliability'' with suborbital flights and other orbital services, according to the Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, companies planning to offer suborbital trips are already involved in the type of service boasts and fare battles common among airlines, whose early days are often likened to the current state of space companies. While Virgin Galactic, for example, is charging $200,000, Space Adventures, working with Texas-based Armadillo Aerospace, says it can get you there for about half that. And that's not even the cheapest: a company called <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> is working on a nifty little space coupe called the Lynx, which would offer a two-person flight -- just you and the pilot -- for $95,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is more like the 'Right Stuff'-kind of experience,'' said Col. Richard Searfoss, a company test pilot, in a promotional video on the Web site. Missions are expected to start by 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the flights are operational, they will be brief and action-packed. SpaceShipTwo, for instance, will carry six passengers and two pilots. Attached to a twin-fuselage jet, it will take off from Spaceport America, a sleek, futuristic complex on a desolate patch of ranchland in southern New Mexico. It will then cruise to about 50,000 feet, where it will detach and tip skyward, blasting off toward higher orbit. Noise and some serious G-forces will ensue, but once customers reach 60 miles or so, they will coast along in almost complete silence. (Except for your gabby co-astronauts, no doubt.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASSENGERS will then be able to unbuckle from their seats, float in weightlessness and take some killer vacation photos. And oh, what a view: hundreds of miles in every direction, with a glimpse of the Earth's curve and the luminous arc of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re-entry will be a little more intense, with the ship's wings folding and body-depressing G-forces, until it arrives at about 70,000 feet, at which point the wings will open again and the plane will glide back to the Spaceport and the astronaut's giddy family members (and, one hopes, a fully-stocked bar).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the price is steep, the physical requirements are expected to be simple: basic health. And bravery, of course. Paul Barbara, 54, a marina and boat salesman from Babylon, N.Y., said he put down his $200,000 after a lifelong obsession with space. He said he planned to lose some weight before his flight but had no trepidation about being so high above the planet. ''I wouldn't bungee jump,'' he said, ''but I'll go to outer space.'' According to Virgin Galactic, the passenger list already includes a teenager and a 90-year-old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In promotional materials for Virgin Galactic, Glenys Ambe, an Australian fashion retailer, says she bought a ticket as an early 60th-birthday present to herself. ''How cool,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such awe-struck idealism is echoed by many of the corporate backers of the suborbital business, who dislike the term ''space tourism,'' saying it demeans the true beauty of slipping the bonds of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think in terms of explorers and expeditions,'' said J. Buckner Hightower, the executive vice president of Excalibur Almaz, who said that human space exploration -- versus robotic -- is a guiding principle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manned space has always been my thing,'' he said. ''I grew up reading fiction about humans exploring the cosmos. And I just think that it's a two-legged proposition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When exactly that proposition becomes a statement of fact, mind you, is an open question. Companies still have to clear all sorts of regulatory, legal and logistical hurdles. Certain details -- departure dates, for example -- can be hard to come by. Still, Virgin Galactic says that it has more than 500 confirmed customers, many of whom have paid the entire $200,000 to guarantee a seat. (More recent customers have been asked to put down just 10 percent, which is fully refundable.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Bigelow's company -- whose so-called ''habitats'' are launched in a rocket and then expand like space accordions into rudimentary dwellings -- is in a holding pattern until the company can find carriers capable and ready to transport guests. (But don't chuckle at the concept: two of Mr. Bigelow's futuristic bouncy castles have already been shot into orbit.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the private companies, Space Adventures has perhaps the most established track record, having sent a series of paying customers to the space station over the last decade. Like some of its competitors, Space Adventures sometimes uses technology and facilities from the former Soviet Union, including a launch facility in Kazakhstan (If you're interested, though, you'll have to wait: the next flight isn't scheduled until 2014 or so.) Those trips -- to an orbit of more than 200 miles -- are just one of several spacey options offered by the company. Others include zero-gravity flights on a modified 727, starting at $4,950, and flight training in a centrifuge machine starting at $9,750 (airsickness bag not included).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers of Space Adventures say the cost is worth it. Richard Garriott, a video game designer who grew up in Houston (his father, Owen, was an astronaut), traveled to the space station in 2008 and said that the vistas from on high could be life-changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest single moment was when I could look down and see an area I knew intimately -- Texas -- and then see the rest of the Earth,'' Mr. Garriott recalled. ''I thought, 'I now know the true scale of the Earth by direct observation.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest ticket item is the company's never-before-tried trip to the far side of the moon (similar in destination and price to the Excalibur Almaz trip), which would cost some $150 million, but would allow the buyer to ''become a catalyst for humankind's expansion into space,'' according to the company's Web site. Tom Shelley, the company's president, said he'd already sold one seat (launch is scheduled for 2016 ... or 2017).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moon,'' he said, ''is within our reach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe. Skeptics still have their doubts. Paul Milo, author of ''Your Flying Car Awaits,'' which chronicles various failed predictions about space tourism, among other things, said the idea of an average person going to the moon is still far-fetched. ''To be optimistic, maybe by 2030 that could happen,'' Mr. Milo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Milo was more bullish on suborbital flight, in large part because master marketers like Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos are involved. ''The folks at NASA thought about solving a problem,'' Mr. Milo said of early spaceflights. ''Private companies think about market appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Whitesides, the chief executive and president of Virgin Galactic, agrees that the company's goal is not only to fly people to suborbital space for five minutes, but also to ''establish the first commercial space line,'' with an emphasis on customer service, something that Virgin has road-tested with its cooler-than-thou airline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't just mean that you have a vehicle that works,'' he said. ''You have to have a whole customer experience that works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, customers will have a three-day training course at the Spaceport before launch day. And there is talk of building a hotel nearby for families and other well-wishers. (Mr. Whitesides said he can see the company eventually establishing a hotel in space, too, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THAT said, Mr. Whitesides underscored that the company's bigger mission is to ''keep on opening up space to humanity,'' something that will, he hopes, involve lowering that $200,000 price tag. ''We want it so that it's no longer restricted to the elite-elite,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's just such democratization that Mr. Curran seems to be trying to spread. And while Rochester -- home of the bankrupt <span class="companylink">Eastman Kodak</span> company -- might not seem like a fertile market, Mr. Curran said he'd already sold one Virgin ticket since becoming an accredited space agent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Curran, 55, says space never held a particularly strong lure for him. But this has not stopped him from putting down his own $20,000 deposit -- for a space trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why, he sounds Kennedy-esque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know where it's going to take me, and I don't think it would be fair to get involved with it if I only had some sort of guarantee about what I was going to get out of it,'' he said. ''The question might better be asked: What am I going to contribute to it?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, Calif. -- Matt Heverly, 36, started a recent workday as any young father might: up at 5:30, gulping coffee, fixing a bottle for the baby. He threw on jeans and a T-shirt and drove his two sons to day care. He stopped to get the brakes on his Toyota checked and swung by the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he went to the office ... to drive a $2.5 billion robot on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heverly leads a team of 16 drivers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here. Together, they are responsible for steering a six-wheeled, plutonium-powered rover called Curiosity across the Red Planet's Gale Crater. Equipped with futuristic tools like a laser that can vaporize rock, the 2,000-pound robot arrived on Mars on Aug. 6, and Mr. Heverly took the wheel -- or computer keyboard, actually -- on Aug. 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Driving'' a rover might be a misleading term. There is no joystick or accelerator, for a start. Mr. Heverly and his teammates tell the vehicle where to go next by entering hundreds of computer commands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the driving is not done in real time: during the Martian night, the team plans where to send Curiosity next and sends instructions via radio transmission as the Mars day begins. Then the drivers go home, back to life on Earth, with all of its ''don't forget to take out the garbage'' mundanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to try not to think about what's happening out there, which is, of course, completely impossible,'' Vandi Tompkins, 39, one of the drivers, said with caffeinated exuberance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rover may be executing a successful drive based on your instructions,'' she said, ''or you may have just sent a national asset over a cliff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, as Mr. Heverly put it, ''Last night I drove on Mars, today I mowed the lawn -- it's completely surreal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity's drivers are only a small group within NASA's Mars exploration program, which investigates the Martian climate and geology and oversees an older, more rudimentary rover, Opportunity. Several thousand people work on the Mars program, but it was 30 or so Curiosity team members who struck a worldwide chord last month when NASA shared video of their reaction to the rover's landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wearing matching blue polo shirts for the occasion, the team members were seen listening for a mission controller's confirmation of success -- ''We are wheels down on Mars. Oh, my God!'' -- and breaking out in raucous cheers and high-fives. Bobak Ferdowsi, a flight director who sports a mohawk with red, white and blue streaks, now says, wincing, ''We all looked like Smurfs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe a little. But it was the group's esprit de corps that left the lasting impression. A spoof video, ''We're NASA and We Know It,'' recorded to the beat of the song ''Sexy and I Know It,'' now has 2.4 million views on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. Mr. Ferdowsi, now known online as Mohawk Guy, has 53,000 Twitter followers, up from a couple of hundred before the mission. (The Martian landscape is ''pretty amazeballs,'' he wrote in a post on Aug. 23.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People inside Building 264 here, part of the Space Flight Operations Facility, have long had a sense of humor about themselves -- at one rocket launching, a group of scientists wore Spock ears. ''It's just that before social media, nobody was really watching,'' Mr. Ferdowsi said. ''I'm still kind of amazed at the attention. I don't think there's anything all that interesting about me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, this is like any other office: gray industrial carpeting, fluorescent lighting, cramped cubicles that are mostly undecorated, unless you count empty cans of Red Bull. A small pantry has packages of dried fruit snacks. There is the occasional potluck dinner and an office softball team; at a recent game, everyone wore fake mohawks to tease Mr. Ferdowsi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the elevator, people say things like ''Can you press seven? I'm going to Jupiter.'' They are not kidding. The seventh floor is home to Juno, a mission to the solar system's largest planet. (Mars is on six and four.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a quiet cockiness. ''We definitely win the coolest job contest at cocktail parties,'' said John Wright, 56, a Curiosity driver who had reported to work in a baseball cap, a T-shirt and shorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What do you do? Oh, you're an investment banker? Isn't that special,'' Mr. Wright continued. ''I drive on Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job can be grueling. For at least the first three months of Curiosity's multiyear exploration, the drivers will be living and working on Mars time. The Martian day, called a Sol, is longer than a day on Earth by 39 minutes and 35 seconds, which adds up quickly; morning on Earth becomes night on Mars within a couple of weeks. For the drivers, keeping this schedule is like moving two time zones to the west every three days, tossing them into a perpetual state of jet lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm kind of so sleep-deprived at this point that I'm beyond the point where caffeine helps,'' Mr. Heverly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heverly became a driver in an amusingly simple way. He started working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory seven years ago after obtaining a master's degree in robotics from <span class="companylink">Boston University</span>. ''And one day they literally sent out an e-mail that said, 'Does anybody want to drive a rover?' '' he said. He raised his hand (''Like, duh'') and, after a year of training, began commanding Opportunity. He worked with that rover for four years before switching to Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who decides who gets to drive and when? Drivers are scheduled by supervisors several weeks in advance, with attention paid to having some of each of people who specialize in certain rover functions: mobility, arm, turret. Up to half a dozen drivers work any one shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workdays have a rigorous time structure. Curiosity beams down a report at 4 p.m. Mars time (one recent Thursday, that meant 1:44 p.m. Pacific time) of how its drive went. A group of analysts has 15 minutes to figure out if everything succeeded, a self-imposed deadline to get the planning for the next day's drive moving quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists -- there are about 400 working on the Mars mission -- evaluate the data, which usually includes pictures from onboard cameras. Drivers arrive and meet with scientists to discuss where the rover should head next, perhaps 15 feet toward an indentation in the soil that looks interesting. Because they are essentially driving Curiosity blind, they initially have to move slowly, a maximum of 30 feet a day; eventually they will be able to cover about 300 feet a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a plan has been formulated, drivers stare at the images they have of the Martian terrain with 3-D glasses to scout for potential pitfalls (''How afraid are we of that rock?'') and use computer animation to simulate a route. Then they enter hundreds of commands to execute the next day's drive, which can require calibration of movement in gradations of centimeters. They message the rover, hoping that it understands and that no one entered an incorrect code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heverly, turning white, recalled ''a nightmare scenario'' with Opportunity. One day, scientists decided that they wanted the rover to back up. Based on the commands Mr. Heverly entered, Opportunity understood that it needed to return to a spot a few feet back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But instead of simply backing up, it decided to drive around the entire planet to get there,'' Mr. Heverly said. Luckily, an automated safety function kicked in and stopped the rover before it could go very far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a really scary and really humbling day,'' Mr. Heverly said. ''It gives a whole new meaning to 'What did you do at the office today, honey?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has spotted pieces of an old streambed where water rushed by billions of years ago, scientists reported at a news conference on Thursday. ''It just seemed like someone came along the surface of Mars with a jackhammer and lifted up a sidewalk that you might see in downtown L.A.,'' said John Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist. From the size of the rounded pebbles embedded in the slab, the scientists estimated that water was flowing about a yard a second and was between ankle and hip deep. NASA has found bountiful evidence of liquid water on early Mars when it might have been warmer, but this was the first observation of an ancient streambed. Curiosity is looking for carbon-based molecules which, together with liquid water, could have provided all of the necessary building blocks for life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the first presidential debate coming up on Wednesday, it is striking -- if not surprising -- how bland and predictable the candidates have been in discussing America's role in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, President Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney, each responded at length to a question posed by ScienceDebate 2012 about the nation's goals in space. But while both emphasized the importance of space exploration, with Mr. Obama briefly mentioning the need for monitoring the Earth, neither candidate, and neither party, has addressed the scientific question of why we want to bother with exploring space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issues that were addressed explicitly -- national pride, technological innovation, national security -- may be interesting and relevant, but they are largely spinoffs of what is usually claimed to be a grand scientific adventure. This is not a new phenomenon. Tapes of John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office released last month made it clear that from his perspective, science was irrelevant to the space race he proclaimed back in 1962. What counted was beating the Russians to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe scientists should simply face reality and accept that science doesn't play a central role in the government's equation. Yet as much as GPS navigation is of great help to me, and as fun as it looks to be an astronaut floating around the International Space Station, I suspect I am not alone in being far more excited by the images produced by NASA's unmanned space probes -- which do the science, after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, every time I see a Hubble Space Telescope photograph showing hundreds of galaxies, each containing billions of stars whose light has taken billions of years to travel to the Hubble cameras, it inspires me to ponder whether they may have been surrounded by now-frozen planets harboring long-dead civilizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And closer to home, I have to admit that I am in love with Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that NASA rover landed on Mars this summer, I was privileged to be near the deep-space antenna in Tidbinbilla, Australia, where the signals from Curiosity were beamed before they were forwarded to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. I haven't been as excited to watch a spacecraft land on another body since I was a kid and stayed home to watch Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin land on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe I was more excited about Curiosity, not just because I was closer to the action but because the astounding complexity of the landing was achieved without any direct human intervention, in just nine minutes -- considerably shorter than the time light takes to travel from Mars to Earth. Knowing that the spacecraft had either landed or crashed 15 minutes earlier made the anticipation seem even more pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is why unmanned space exploration seems to me much more exciting and scientifically worthwhile than human spaceflight, especially at a time of restricted budgets and nascent technology. Sending Curiosity to Mars cost only about 10 times what it would cost to make a movie about sending Bruce Willis to Mars -- and perhaps a hundredth of the cost of actually sending humans there and back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of my colleagues are geologists who are not shy about pointing out that a human geologist could do in a few days what Curiosity may do in a year or two. But we aren't likely to send geologists there anytime soon -- and if we did, they wouldn't be able to stay much longer than a few days, while Curiosity can silently and gently move about the planet for a decade or more, powered by its plutonium generator. Moreover, by the time we might get around to sending humans, in two to three decades at best, robots will have advanced to the point where they might easily compete in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of scientific payoff, it makes far more sense to spend money on Mars rovers, since 99 percent of the cost of sending humans into space involves keeping them alive and getting them back, leaving precious little for science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But cost aside, I find the adventure more exciting. The thought of Curiosity braving the Martian days and nights alone -- rolling slowly along, zapping rocks and occasionally picking them up, sending stunning, detailed photos of an alien terrain like a tourist using a cellphone to communicate with loved ones back home -- is both heartwarming and bittersweet. Every time I go to the NASA Web site and open up a new photo of the day's tour, I feel as if I am there. If it takes a year to get to the base of a nearby mountain, who cares? I will enjoy every step of the journey even more because it is a gentle one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the coming decades we may send more robotic explorers to even harsher climes, maybe to explore deep oceans on Jupiter's moon Europa, or to search on comets for telltale signs of life's origins. We may send powerful telescopes into space that may one day photograph distant worlds that may harbor life. For me, sending these probes where no man or woman has gone before is every bit as thrilling as imagining Captain Kirk being teleported down to an alien surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while such probes may do less for national security than sending satellites to orbit the Earth to spy on our friends and enemies, I am reminded of a statement by Robert R. Wilson, the first director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. When asked during a Congressional hearing whether the particle accelerator would aid in the defense of the nation, he said it would not -- but it would help keep the nation worth defending.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first commercial cargo flight to the International Space Station lifted off on Sunday evening, inaugurating a new era for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> in which private companies will take over the transportation of people and supplies to low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this launch, only cargo is going; private transportation for astronauts is still several years away. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span> of Hawthorne, Calif. -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short -- launched its Falcon 9 rocket on schedule at 8:35 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket is carrying a capsule called Dragon that contains about 1,000 pounds of food, clothing, equipment and science experiments, including 23 designed and built by students. The cargo also includes a freezer that can store laboratory samples at temperatures as low as 300 degrees below zero. The goods are scheduled to reach the space station on Wednesday, and the capsule will stay docked for a few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It actually marks the beginning of true commercial spaceflight to take cargo to the International Space Station for us,'' Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, said during a video chat on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Plus on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> successfully launched a capsule to the space station in a test flight in May, but Sunday's launching is the first of a dozen flights under a $1.6 billion contract with <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The student projects come through a program run by NanoRacks, a company that arranges for experiments to fly to the space station, and the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education. They include one from middle school students in Santa Monica, Calif., who want to know whether Silly Putty -- a non-Newtonian dilatant fluid, in scientific terms -- has different properties in the weightlessness of space than it does on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plans, the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> spacecraft will return to Earth near the end of October and splash down about 250 miles off the coast of Southern California. A successful mission would restore some of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s ability to bring back items from the space station, which it lost with the termination of the space shuttle program last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second company, the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., is preparing its rocket for a test flight this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDBringing the search for another Earth about as close as it will ever get, a team of European astronomers was scheduled to announce on Wednesday that it had found a planet the same mass as Earth's in Alpha Centauri, a triple star system that is the Sun's closest neighbor, only 4.4 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is the lightest one ever found orbiting another star and -- in the words of its discoverer, Xavier Dumusque, a graduate student at the Geneva Observatory -- ''it will surely be the closest one ever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is presumably a rocky ball like our own, but it is not habitable. It circles Alpha Centauri B, a reddish orb about half as luminous as the Sun, every three days at a distance of only about four million miles, resulting in hellish surface temperatures of 1,200 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this is not ''Earth 2.0.'' Yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the discovery raised the possibility that there were habitable Earthlike planets right next door and that methods and instruments were now precise enough to detect them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very small planets are not rare,'' said Mr. Dumusque, who is the lead author of a paper being published on Wednesday in Nature. ''When you find one small planet, you find others.'' He and his colleagues discussed the results on Tuesday in a news conference hosted by the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> in Garching, Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers were electrified by the news of the planet, but also cautioned that it needed confirmation by other astronomers, not an easy task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Fischer, a Yale astronomer who has been searching for planets in that same system for years, said: ''The discovery that our nearest neighbor has rocky planets is the story of the decade. I'd bet $100 that there are other planets that are there as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery also underscored the allure of Alpha Centauri as a target of space and scientific exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is close enough you can almost spit there,'' said Geoffrey Marcy, an exoplanet astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an e-mail, ''I feel like we should drop everything and send a probe there to study the new planet and others that are likely in the system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three stars in that system. Alpha Centauri A, which is slightly larger and brighter than the Sun, and Alpha Centauri B, slightly smaller, are close companions, circling each other and passing as close as 900 million miles every 80 years. They in turn are being circled at a much greater distance, some one trillion miles, by a dwarf star that is known as Proxima Centauri because it is slightly closer to the Earth, due to that trillion miles, than the other two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called habitable zone of Alpha Centauri B, where temperatures would be moderate enough for water and creatures like us, is about 65 million miles from the star, where a year would take 200 days or so, about the same as the orbit of Venus in our own system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dumusque and his colleagues found the planet by the so-called wobble method, using a specially built spectrograph called HARPS on a 140-inch diameter telescope at the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> in La Silla, Chile, to track the host star as it is tugged to and fro by the planet's gravity. After four years and 450 observations, they found that in the case of Alpha Centauri B, that tug imparts a velocity of about 20 inches a second, a leisurely walking speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the smallest wobble the Swiss team has ever observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A planet only four times as massive as the Earth would produce the same amount of wobble if it was out in the habitable zone and would thus be detectable by their instrument, Mr. Dumusque said. But it would take a long time. ''If you want to find a planet at 200 days,'' he said referring to the orbital period, ''you need 8 to 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy said this was the kind of discovery that could reignite interest in other experiments like the Terrestrial Planet Finder, a space observatory for studying exoplanets that was once at the top of NASA's wish list but is now languishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Dr. Marcy startled his colleagues at an M.I.T. symposium with a bitter criticism of NASA, the National Academy of Sciences and the planetary community itself for failing to define and sell advanced exoplanet missions. He went on to call for an international project to launch a scientific probe to Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could take hundreds of years, but such a mission, Dr. Marcy said, could jolt NASA out of its doldrums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet, Dr. Marcy said, ''fits right into that rant.'' He went on, ''What a great scientific educational mission to have a probe out there, making its way decade after decade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 19, 2012, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a new planet discovered in the Alpha Centauri system misstated the distance between Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, the two main stars in the triple-star system. Every 80 years, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B pass within about 900 million miles of each other -- not nine billion miles.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The theater of the daredevil's jump had a deliberate déjà vu quality, evoking the heady dawn of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were the neat rows of concerned people at computers, resembling NASA's mission control in Houston. The calm voice on earth guiding a cryptic, staticky voice in the heavens. The picture of Earth spinning below. The puffy white suit and bulbous helmet. The utterance of one of those telegraphic banalities that become profound when issued from the dark beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Felix Baumgartner fell back to us from more than 128,000 feet, or 39,000 meters, above, watched by millions, it was less a reprise of space age glory than a reminder of how different glory can be in our own time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different in two ways in particular. The endeavor, like so many endeavors in an age of tired, broke and austere governments, was a triumph of private rather than collective ambitions. And it was a triumph that seemed to belong to no one place but all the world -- and as a result also belonged to no one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iconic letters of the early years of space travel -- USA for the Americans, CCCP for the Soviets -- gave way to new letters this time: they spelled ''Red Bull,'' for the energy drink company (which, like Mr. Baumgartner, is Austrian) that sponsored the expedition and reaped its payback in endless mentions in glowing news coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new letters underlined how space travel has changed in the nation that first put a man on the moon. With NASA ending the Space Shuttle program and refocusing on orchestrating private missions, such work seems likely to go the way of sports stadiums and television shows. It will, more and more, be brought to you by somebody selling something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Baumgartner landed in the New Mexico desert after his free fall, his costume mimicked Neil Armstrong's. But the ensuing moments disrupted the analogy. His double fist pump was the gesture of a sports hero, not a man just returned from ''the edge of space,'' as the marketing materials phrased it. The organizers had ensured that, before anything else, a photographer alighted from a helicopter and got the money shots for a planet of eager fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Baumgartner's relationship with viewers was intimate, with the audience hearing him breathe and pant as he fell, it was also strangely solitary, as though viewers were merely voyeurs and not also participants. It came across so differently from the old television footage of the moon landing in 1969, when Mr. Armstrong's ''small step'' seemed to be taken on behalf of every human who could not be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Armstrong was, of course, representing a country. He was a mere servant of a public mission voted, paid and cheered for by the American people. Mr. Baumgartner was on a much humbler mission, and it was structured as a private project, not unlike your typical global company -- based in one place, with talent from some other places and funding from other places still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this more fragmentary kind of mission is good or bad depends on where you stand. Space seems likely to become yet another corner of the global market, with free individuals coming together spontaneously to pursue projects in their mutual interest. That, to some, might seem vulgar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you're an Indonesian and the brightest astronaut mind of your generation, the 1960s wouldn't have been a great time to grow up. In this more fragmentary and open world, you might get to leave earth on a vessel built by Japanese, financed by Russians, guided from the ground by Americans and launched from Colombian soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet things so diffuse in their provenance can struggle to inspire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions watched Mr. Baumgartner fall. But because the project belonged to the whole world, it didn't much belong to anyone. People watched on their phones, their tablets, their laptops -- on devices built for one -- and on television, too. Some watched live; others, later. But the event lacked the emotive force it seemed designed to set off. There was none of the patriotism that can attend such things, because Mr. Baumgartner was presented as Red Bull's sky-jumping man, not Austria's, America's or anyplace else's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It reminded me of the new stadium near where I live in New York. It's not called Brooklyn Stadium, but rather Barclays Center. It involves a partnership among an American real-estate tycoon, a rapper from the neighborhood, a British bank, a basketball team imported from New Jersey and a Russian billionaire. They are working to make Brooklynites feel it is their own, but it strikes many as being not quite that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is in all this a kind of historical return. Many hundred years ago, before the nation-state had risen and perfected its tax-and-spend prowess, many of the boldest human doings were of the brought-to-you-by variety -- sponsored by private families like the Medicis, feudal overlords, clans and tribes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation-state allowed for undertakings, like the investigation of space, that eclipsed what private ambition could achieve. But in a more fluid, interconnected world, in this age of private ascendancy and public contraction, that older type of striving is back. We may again know times in which the greatest human endeavors are private ones -- thrilling, mesmerizing even, and not quite ours.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overview | Space is enormous. How can we conceptualize the vast distances between objects in our solar system and beyond? In this lesson, students calculate the relative distances between planets in our solar system, build a model illustrating those distances to scale and compare the model with standard solar system illustrations. Note to teachers: Be prepared to extend this model throughout the school and the school grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Materials | Computers with Internet access, projection equipment to show video, a standard image of our solar system, tape measure, calculators and objects of various sizes to create a model of the solar system, like a soccer ball, Ping-Pong ball, marble and small dried beans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warm-Up | When students arrive, show "The Known Universe,"[http://youtu.be/17jymDn0W6U] a video from the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>. As they watch, ask students to identify familiar features they recognize, like Earth's oceans and atmosphere, planets, orbits, stars, the galaxy and more. Pause or replay the video to identify as many features as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, hold up an object, like a Ping-Pong ball, and ask students how they might build a model to scale to show relative sizes and orbits of the planets in our solar system. Then extend the question to include other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell students they will read an article about the discovery of a new planet orbiting a neighboring star. If necessary, review basic astronomy terms[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/index.cfm] with your students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related | The article "New Planet in Neighborhood, Astronomically Speaking"[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/science/space/new-planet-found-in-alpha-centauri.html] describes the discovery of a new planet orbiting a star that is relatively close to our own solar system:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bringing the search for another Earth about as close as it will ever get, a team of European astronomers was scheduled to announce on Wednesday that it had found a planet the same mass as Earth's in Alpha Centauri, a triple star system that is the Sun's closest neighbor, only 4.4 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is the lightest one ever found orbiting another star and - in the words of its discoverer, Xavier Dumusque, a graduate student at the Geneva Observatory - "it will surely be the closest one ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Background Vocabulary: You may wish to introduce students to the following words or concepts before reading: Alpha Centauri, exoplanet, light year, habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions | For reading comprehension and discussion:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The article describes the discovery of a planet. How is that planet similar to Earth? How is it different?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Compare the Alpha Centauri star system with our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Why are astronomers excited about this discovery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity | Just how enormous is our solar system? Show students an image of our solar system[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/index.cfm]. Explain that typical solar system diagrams are often not to scale or they scale the distances between planets and their sizes independently. Tell students that they will make calculations to create a model of the solar system that is to scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a class, decide what object could represent the Sun and measure its diameter. For this exercise, a 12-inch diameter ball is one possible size for the Sun, but offer students the opportunity to work through the calculations for several different model Sun sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Divide the class into groups and assign each group a planet. Ask students to use the information table below, plus the diameter of the model Sun chosen by the class, to determine the size of their planet and orbit radius for the model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below is an example calculation to determine the size of the model Earth, when using a 12-inch diameter Sun:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Earth's diameter / Sun's diameter) * x inch model Sun diameter =</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12,742 km / 1,391,900 km) * 12-inches =</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer: The diameter of the model Earth will be 0.1099 inches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Draw a chart on the board and have students fill in their answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, determine the model distance to Alpha Centauri (actual distance is 4.03964E+13 km).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note to teachers: Check answers using a solar system scale model online calculator[http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/solar_system/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the model distances are calculated, ask students to discuss building the scale model of the solar system. What are the challenges of this model? Does the model need to be adjusted, perhaps by changing the size of the model Sun (and if so, recalculate the model sizes and distances)? What materials could represent the different planets? Where will the planets be placed in the classroom, the school or the surrounding property? Will any planets have to be left out of the model for logistical reasons? Where would Alpha Centauri be located?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, have students research their planets[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/index.cfm], including their composition, atmosphere, orbit length, presence (or absence) of moons and any additional information, and prepare to present what they've learned during the final building of the model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have students complete the model by choosing appropriately sized objects to represent the planets. Then, as a class, measure and place the model planets the correct distances from the model Sun, within the classroom, the school and beyond, as conditions allow. While walking to place the planet models, ask students to present information about their planets. To conclude, discuss what's missing from this model (like moons, asteroids, meteors, the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud). Finally, challenge students to compare their model with the typical solar system illustrations found online and in textbooks and discuss the difficulty of grasping the distances between planets, other star systems and galaxies beyond our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going Further | Students read "Discovery Rekindles Wish for a Journey to the Stars"[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/science/space/discovery-rekindles-wish-for-a-journey-to-the-stars.html] and then write plans for interstellar space travel, addressing the challenges of traveling vast distances in space[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/science/space/discovery-rekindles-wish-for-a-journey-to-the-stars.html/] and space travel plans already under development[http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/].</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mars and the Science of Skipping Stones</span>
</div><div class="author">By JOHN GROTZINGER   </div><div>1096 words</div><div>27 October 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The International Herald Tribune</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was a kid, my dad taught me the science of skipping stones. There on the rocky banks of a little stream behind our house in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, he coached me not only on the proper pitching motion, but on the significance of the right equipment. While the throw was important, it was the stone itself that held the secrets to a good skip. Recently, we have found stones just like the best skippers -- 180 million miles away from Huntingdon Valley. These stones are on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the chief scientist for NASA's Curiosity Mars rover, locating such a smooth and flat rock on the Red Planet means water once flowed there -- and nothing could be more important. It means that we sent our plutonium-powered, S.U.V.-sized, six-wheeled, science-instrumented vehicle to the right place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting early confirmation that we came to the right place is a huge deal -- and it has come early in the mission. We landed Curiosity on Aug. 5 on a place on Mars called Gale Crater. We've logged more than two months operating the most technologically advanced vehicle in all of recorded history, and we have about two years left in our prime mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is our prime mission? We built Curiosity to investigate whether conditions could have been favorable for microbial life and for preserving clues in the rocks about possible past life. On Earth, wherever you find water you find life. Not having liquid water present on the surface of Mars now means we need to look into its history for a time when water ranged across the surface. Which leads me back to Gale Crater, which is bone dry, and why it relates to our skipping stones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, we know skipping stones don't end up on a shore or beach by accident. It's Mother Nature who places them there after a long and bumpy journey that could take millions of years and cover hundreds of miles. Part of the reason we know this is because skipping stones don't start out looking and feeling like skipping stones. They begin their life like most other rocks, jagged shards of material somehow sheared away from the Earth's crust by the movement of tectonic plates or by erosion. The difference is, they are exposed to a moving fluid for an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its water-propelled journey here on Earth, our rock is pummeled by particles and thrown into obstructions only to be pushed farther along by the force of water. Each impact it endures, however minute, leaves its mark. Many years later, the rock has been transformed into the smooth-surfaced creation that begs to be flung at a low angle across the water. In the geology world this process is known as abrasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when we see rounded rocks on Mars we know that at that location a river ran through it, at some point in its history. From the size and the shapes of the mixture of stones found together come clues to the speed of the water flow and the distance that the stones have traveled to reach their present location. Working the data we have received so far, we believe the water source that propelled our skipping stone to its present location was anywhere from ankle to hip-deep and flowed at about 3 feet per second. The distance traveled and the source of the water is unknown, but in my mind's eye I can picture the different scenarios that could bring that little stone into existence. And to a planetary geologist, each and every one of them has its own inner and outer beauty. Perhaps one day, our insatiable Curiosity will help us learn which of these scenarios is correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, we've put our skipping stones in the rover's rearview mirror (several of our 17 cameras watched them disappear over the horizon) and moved forward in both time and space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just the other day, we crossed another significant threshold of the mission by processing our first sample of Mars in one of Curiosity's onboard chemistry labs. Essentially, we're eating dirt and loving it. With this step, we've begun doing the kind of exacting scientific research you would usually only be able to accomplish in a fully stocked laboratory at a university or research center. Now, we're doing it on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What these findings will tell us we're not sure. But we do know that Gale Crater, the skipping stones and the baby aspirin-sized sample of Martian dirt the rover just ingested all have a story to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norman Maclean wrote in his seminal work, ''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories'': ''Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our waters may be over a hundred million miles away and over a thousand million years back in time from the Big Blackfoot River Maclean was referring to, but that makes little difference. Those of us working on NASA's Curiosity mission are haunted by waters as well. Where those ancient waters lead us remains to be seen, but they provide us with our roadmap. Now it's just up to our instruments and our patience with a few detours if we feel the need to explore tributaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagine that the pursuit of this clear liquid and the stories and worlds it helps recreate will go on well beyond our rover's mission. That someday, an astronaut may very well walk in the treaded footsteps of Curiosity and find these stones or ones like them. When that day happens, 180 million miles away from home, in Gale Crater or elsewhere on the planet of Mars, for at least a moment, they might think back to their own simpler time when, on the shoreline of some body of water, they first learned the value of the perfect stone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, I imagine, they'll get back to work because on Mars there is a lot to see, a lot to do, and a lot to learn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first commercial spacecraft to carry cargo to the International Space Station splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Sunday, completing a three-week mission that was mostly successful though far from flawless. A small California technology company, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, launched its cargo-carrying capsule atop its Falcon 9 rocket on Oct. 7 and almost immediately encountered a problem when one of the rocket's nine engines shut down shortly after liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mishap did not prevent the cargo from reaching the station, but it did make it impossible to place a secondary payload, a prototype communications satellite, into the proper orbit. The satellite's owner, Orbcomm, said it had achieved some useful test results before the satellite fell out of orbit and burned up in the atmosphere, so it was not a total failure. The company says it plans to launch more satellites aboard <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rockets in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA was clearly pleased with the mission. Since the retirement of the space shuttle fleet last year, the agency has relied primarily on Russia to send cargo and astronauts up the space station and back. Now NASA is trying to turn over the routine tasks of carrying cargo -- and eventually, astronauts -- to the space station while it focuses its human spaceflight program on exploration of the inner solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> currently has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to carry out at least 11 more cargo resupply missions through 2016. Another company, the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., has built a new cargo spacecraft under NASA contract and is preparing for a test flight next year. The best news from this first commercial flight is that the Falcon 9 rocket was able to complete its cargo delivery mission despite the loss of an engine. Although it was not perfect, the outing shows that private companies can carry out relatively mundane tasks like space cargo transport.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflating, at least for now, hopes of microbial life forms inhabiting the soils of Mars, NASA's rover Curiosity has so far come up empty in its search for the gas methane. At a NASA news conference on Friday, scientists reported that the Mars rover's instruments had seen no signs of methane, which, had it been there, would have signaled that there might currently be methane-exhaling microorganisms on Mars that are similar to those found on Earth. In Martian air, methane molecules are broken down by sunlight and chemical reactions within a few hundred years. Thus, when three teams of scientists reported in 2004 that they had detected methane there, it raised the possibility that something on present-day Mars was creating methane, and the most exciting possibility was tiny life forms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ancient starlight, emitted by the first stars in the universe, has been detected using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope [http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marco Ajello, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues report the finding [http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2872/content/early/2012/10/31/science.1227160.abstract] in the current issue of the journal Science. Dr. Ajello conducted the research while working at Stanford University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These were probably the very first objects to form in our universe,” he said. “They formed just about 500 million years after the Big Bang.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists suggest that the Big Bang occurred about 13 billion years ago, resulting in the creation of our universe, which continues to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stars in the universe were massive and primarily made up of hydrogen. They probably burned through the hydrogen quickly and exploded into supernovas early on. Although those original stars are long gone, the light from them is still traveling to us, Dr. Ajello said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measuring the ancient starlight directly was impossible because the light from our own galaxy is overpowering. So instead, the researchers used gamma rays. For this, they relied on blazars, faraway galaxies that emit gamma rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They are like lighthouses farther and farther away from us,” Dr. Ajello said. “They are located at different distances from us, and from them we are able to measure the amount of starlight in different epochs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers collected data on light in the universe 4 billion years, 8 billion years and 11 billion years after the Big Bang. In the future, Dr. Ajello hopes to take measurements at points even closer to the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since the universe is always expanding, the best way to measure is to go as early as possible in the history of the universe,” he said. “Two billion or one billion years after the Big Bang will give us more accurate measurements.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE voters have spoken. So, what now? How will our still divided government deal with our mounting threats and challenges?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shared fear can help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Bedouin proverb says, ''Me against my brother, my brothers and me against my cousins, then my cousins and me against strangers.'' Human beings are pretty good at uniting to fight at whatever level is most important at a given moment. This is why every story about a team of warriors or superheroes features an internal rivalry, but all hatchets are buried just before the climactic final battle in which the team vanquishes the external enemy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national election focuses our attention on a single level of competition -- political party versus political party. Let's call that ''me and my brother against our cousin.'' But after that, it's time for our national team to come together to fight the many threats and enemies that confront us. Let's unite with our cousins to fight the stranger!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except that we didn't do it four years ago, when things looked even grimmer, and there's no sign that we're going to do it now. Since the 1990s we've been stuck at one level -- party versus party. Partisanship is not a bad thing. We need multiple teams to develop competing visions for voters to choose among. But when so many of our leaders can't even occasionally place national interest before party interest, we've crossed over into hyperpartisanship. And that's a very bad thing, because it amplifies other problems like the debt crisis, the absence of a rational immigration policy and our aging infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We the people bear some of the blame for what's happened in <span class="companylink">Congress</span>, for we, too, have become more angrily partisan. So what can we do to pull ourselves up to that higher level? How can we unite not just with our brothers and sisters, but with our cousins?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way is to focus on common threats, rather than on common ground, just as the Bedouin proverb suggests. It's only the threat of the stranger that brings the extended family together. A physical attack by outsiders -- like Pearl Harbor or 9/11 -- binds people together like nothing else. But what if there is no such attack? Can trade competition with China do it? What about a threat we created ourselves?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, that depends. A basic principle of moral psychology is that ''morality binds and blinds.'' In many pre-agricultural societies, groups achieved trust and unity by circling around sacred objects. In modern societies, much larger groups bind themselves together by treating certain books, flags, leaders or ideals as sacred and by symbolically circling around them. But if your team circles too fast, you lose the ability to see clearly or think for yourself. You go blind to evidence that contradicts your group's moral consensus, and you become enraged at teammates who suggest that the other side is not entirely bad (as New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, is now finding out).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike a foreign attack, a problem that threatens only one side's sacred values can therefore divide us, rather than unite us. It's as though a giant asteroid is headed for the Earth. One side sees it coming and screams, but the louder it screams, the more stubbornly the other side covers its ears and averts its eyes. Here are a few of the asteroids hurtling toward us, which half of us can already see with our naked eyes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising temperatures. The left has been raising the alarm about global warming since the 1990s. It's a threat to the environment and to poor people around the world -- sacred values for liberals -- but the right largely denies the scientific consensus, in part because many of the remedies would require limits on industry and intervention into markets (which would violate sacred values for some conservatives). Hurricane Sandy gave us a small taste of what's likely to happen more frequently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising entitlements. The right has railed against entitlement spending since the 1960s, and its frustration boiled over in the Tea Party movement. The welfare state is a threat to traditional conservative values of personal responsibility (people have less incentive to plan for their own future) and fiscal solvency. Despite the logical errors in Mitt Romney's ''47 percent'' comments, we do face bankruptcy when the baby boomers retire and a shrinking percentage of workers must pay the ever growing expenses of a ballooning class of retirees. Yet the Democrats want to ''protect'' older Americans, students and almost everyone else from the need to sacrifice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising inequality. The left has been protesting rising inequality since Ronald Reagan cut taxes on the rich and benefits for the poor, and a great deal of recent scholarship documents the socially, morally and economically damaging effects of separating the haves ever further from the have-nots. Nearly all the gains in productivity in the last 30 years have gone to the wealthiest, but the right justifies the trend and denies its toxicity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising births to unmarried women. In 1960, 5 percent of American children were born to unmarried women. In 2010, that number was more than 40 percent. Conservatives treat the traditional family as the irreplaceable building block of society and are therefore horrified that unmarried motherhood will soon be the national norm. The left has been ambivalent about the value of marriage (at least, before the push for gay marriage), sometimes viewing it as a patriarchal institution and reluctant to admit that a stable marriage is very good for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, America faces many serious threats, but each side sees some and denies others. Morality binds and blinds. The philosopher John Stuart Mill described this problem in 1840, noting that in almost all major ideological controversies, ''both sides were in the right in what they affirmed, though wrong in what they denied, and that if either could have been made to take the other's views in addition to its own, little more would have been needed to make its doctrine correct.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see Mill's diagnosis in action, note that marriage is disappearing primarily among Americans without a four-year college degree. Marriage confers so many benefits on children that it helps them rise into the upper tier of wealth; children who don't benefit from a stable marriage are more likely to fall. So if you are a liberal who is worried about the inequality asteroid, you might consider teaming up with a conservative group trying to promote marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then you'd run smack into the problem that women rarely want to marry a man with no job and poor prospects. So if you are a conservative who cares about the unmarried-mother asteroid, you might want to team up with liberal groups working to improve educational equality and to find ways to keep poor young men in school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we focus only on the one asteroid that most frightens us, we feel anger at the partisans on the other side. We curse their blindness without recognizing our own. But if we can look up into the sky and see a whole fleet of asteroids heading for us, we lose our tunnel vision and experience a healthy form of panic. We're in big trouble, and anyone who does that hyperpartisan stuff now should be ashamed -- or kicked out of office. The day after Election Day is the day for all of us, and our siblings and cousins, to come together and start building an asteroid deflection system.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JEPP, WHO DEFIED THE STARS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Katherine Marsh</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">385 pp. Hyperion. $16.99. (Young adult; ages 12 and up)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-conscious about your body? Unsure where — or if — you’ll ever fit in? Wondering when people will start treating you like an adult? Katherine Marsh’s “Jepp, Who ­Defied the Stars” delves into these perennial adolescent challenges while transporting her readers to a tiny island in Denmark in the late 16th century — and without the help of either time machine or wizard. Instead Marsh turns to one of history’s ­real-life magicians, the brilliant, eccentric astronomer Tycho Brahe, to welcome her readers to his castle-cum-­observatory, Uraniborg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Danish noble, Brahe lacks the renown of his apprentice, Johannes Kepler, but he made similarly significant contributions to astronomy, especially for a pioneer whose work was unaided by the yet-to-be-invented telescope. Kepler’s discoveries about planetary motion rest on the work of the half-scientist, half-Mad Hatter Brahe, who kept a dipsomaniac moose as a pet, and a dwarf named Jepp as court jester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the novel, the fictionalized Jepp travels from his home in Astraveld, a kind of crossroads “claimed by both the Spanish Netherlands and the Protestant North,” to the Infanta Isabella’s palace in Brussels, and then from Brussels on to the “intricate universe” of Uraniborg. There Jepp will be delivered from the status of a dog at Brahe’s feet, dependent on scraps from his master’s dinner, to that of an esteemed scientist in his own right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrating a young adult novel from a dwarf’s perspective is nothing short of inspired. Jepp’s physical form may be a ticket out of poverty to the castles of royalty and aristocrats, but it also amplifies the miseries of adolescence. Readers will feel an immediate sympathy for the eternally child-size Jepp, allowed the luxuries of court life for the price of his dignity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demonstrated by the recent dystopian swell, the themes of Y.A. fiction — bullying, sexual confusion, substance abuse, delinquency, identity, first love and broken hearts — have never been lighthearted. But Marsh pushes these aside to focus on the central and unanswerable question of free will. Does it exist? Or, to couch the question in an era in which astrology was a “sister art” to astronomy, Can man defy the stars and direct his own destiny?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predestination is a heavy topic, but in this case it is leavened by Marsh’s meticulous research into the strange lot of court dwarves, and the wonderful and outlandish world of one of history’s more idiosyncratic geniuses, whose behavior provides virtually unlimited amusement. Having lost his nose in a duel, Brahe (in fact as well as fiction) wears a prosthetic one, copper for ­everyday and silver on formal occasions. From his lowly vantage, it falls to Jepp to retrieve the nose when it inevitably slips off the astrologer’s face, whether from exertion or intoxication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jepp comes of age he also comes to believe what all good novelists know: Fate is character, and character cannot be forged by the placement of stars in the firmament. The questions that torment Marsh’s diminutive hero are not much different from those we try to answer in the present day. Are we our DNA or the sum of our experiences? Is each person’s identity the result of a mysterious interplay between what nature gives him and nurture either awakens or smothers? “It is our misfortunes and our mistakes that are our true parents,” Jepp decides. Like all humans, he can be passively buffeted by circumstance or he can apply his will to working with what life has given him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jepp does, as the title of Marsh’s novel announces, defy what another less gifted and determined young man might accept as fate, just as Marsh transcends genre to create an engaging narrative complex enough to keep not-so-young adults turning its pages.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - Over two days of special reports, in print and online, the International Herald Tribune is examining how the global energy landscape is shifting in fundamental ways that few would have predicted, and how new opportunities and risks are arising - geopolitical, economic and environmental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The special reports coincide with a conference in London [http://www.ihtconferences.com/oil-money-2012/agenda.aspx]that the IHT is convening with Energy Intelligence, an energy consultancy, bringing together the top executives in the oil and gas industry, as well as leaders who deal with energy issues in government, academia and the media. The IHT's energy editor, Stanley Reed, and I will be tweeting from the first day of the conference on Tuesday @iht_rdv[https://twitter.com/IHT_RDV] and #OM2012[https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OM2012] and Stanley will be blogging here on RDV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The special print section on Tuesday comes as a new report from the <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> claims that in five years the United States will be the world's largest oil producer[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/energy-environment/report-sees-us-as-top-oil-producer-in-5-years.html] and by 2030 will become a net exporter of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increased oil production, combined with new American policies to improve energy efficiency, means that the United States will become "all but self-sufficient" in meeting its energy needs in about two decades - a "dramatic reversal of the trend" in most developed countries, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The foundations of the global energy systems are shifting," said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the Paris-based organization, which produces the annual World Energy Outlook, in an interview before the release. The agency, which advises industrialized nations on energy issues, had previously predicted that Saudi Arabia would be the leading producer until 2035.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as David Goldwyn, a former <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span> special envoy for international energy and assistant secretary of energy, writes in the lead article in the special report, "The reduced U.S. dependence on crude imports does not mean an end to history[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/energy-environment/making-an-energy-boom-work-for-us.html]. The issues of price volatility, diversity of supply and helping U.S. friends and allies to be free from monopolistic pricing or coercive supply arrangements will remain as vital 20 years from now as they are today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the American oil and gas boom will lead to more jobs and more infrastructure and refining capacity in the United States, but will not end dependency on foreign oil, or American interests being linked to affairs in the turbulent nations where that oil comes from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldwyn says the controversial shale gas boom (a.k.a. fracking[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/natural-gas/index.html]) can lead to environmental and economic benefits globally, if done in an economically sound way, but will require changes in American diplomacy and policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Referring to the largest shale deposits in the United States, he writes, "If the technology and project management deployed in the Marcellus, Barnett and Eagle Ford shales can be even partially replicated in Eastern Europe, China and India, the world could see faster greenhouse gas reduction - through substituting gas for coal - at lower cost than any mechanism envisioned by our climate negotiators."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the special report lays out in stark relief that the more things change on the global energy landscape, the more they stay the same - especially when it comes to coal[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/energy-environment/china-leads-the-way-as-demand-for-coal-surges-worldwide.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dirty, fickle and dangerous, coal may seem an odd contender in a world where promising renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power are attracting attention. Anathema to environmentalists because it creates so much pollution, coal still has the undeniable advantages of being widely available and easy to ship and burn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest attraction, however, is low cost. By many estimates, including that of Li Junfeng, longtime director general of the <span class="companylink">National Development and Reform Commission</span> of China, burning coal still costs about one-third as much as using renewable energy like wind or solar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coal use is expected to increase 50 percent by 2035, said Milton Catelin, executive director of the London-based World Coal Association, who says that coal represented 30 percent of world energy, "the highest share it has had since 1969."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts within a year or two, coal will surpass oil as the planet's primary fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And coal is not the only fossil fuel experiencing a revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shell is betting more than $10 billion by some estimates on just one facility that will reach and process liquified natural gas where it has never been processed on such a scale before: at sea. Shell is building the world's biggest ship, Prelude, as a floating L.N.G. platform off Australia[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/energy-environment/betting-on-gas-shell-floats-plan-on-high-seas.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, in Qatar, Shell "is ramping up production of a facility called Pearl. Not a tiny jewel, Pearl is a sprawling $20 billion network of pipes and tanks designed to perform the alchemy of turning Qatar's matchless natural gas resources into even more valuable diesel and jet fuel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Iain Pyle of Bernstein Research in London figures that Shell could make $1 billion a year in net profit. Prelude will produce a lot of gas - more than enough to supply the needs of Hong Kong, for instance, Shell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming Prelude works, it should provide Shell with a persuasive talking point when it approaches governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marjan van Loon, a Shell vice president for liquefied natural gas, says Shell wants to build a new floating liquefied natural gas project each year "for the foreseeable decades."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmentally concerned readers may be asking, "Prelude to what? Earth: desert planet?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this has a certain Back to the Future element to it. Just a few years ago, many people were talking about a future based on renewable energy as if it were a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the International Energy Agency report[http://iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf] that predicts the United States' rise to leading oil exporter also includes a warning that unchecked energy consumption will have dire consequences for the planet's climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The report confirms that, given the current policies, we will blow past every safe target for emissions," said Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the energy needs of the industrialized world and the rapidly developing world - as well as the cost associated with building renewable-energy infrastructure amid a global economic crisis and new supplies and technology aimed at fossil fuels lowering the costs of exploiting these forms of energy - have pushed renewables into the background and brought the opportunities of old fuels to the fore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll be discussing these issues -- the opportunities and the risks -- in the coming days. We hope you'll join the conversation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rover Curiosity is poised to drive again after being parked at a sand dune for the past month. The mission team said Thursday that the six-wheel rover would head to its next destination in the next several days. Curiosity, while stationary, has been scooping up soil and studying the atmosphere. Its next major task is to find a rock to drill into, and that requires moving to a new spot. The rover landed in August. It is three months into a two-year mission to determine whether the environment could be favorable for microbial life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Scientists say the newly found meteorite Tissint broke off from Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] 700,000 years ago. What has it been doing all this time? And how do they know how long?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. “The short answer is, just orbiting the Sun till the Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] got in the way,” said Gareth V. Williams, associate director of the <span class="companylink">Minor Planet Center</span> of the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>&nbsp;and an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is extremely unlikely that a meteorite blasted off Mars will fly off in&nbsp;an orbit that intersects the Earth on its first orbit,” Dr. Williams said. “It takes time for&nbsp;the initial orbit to be perturbed into an orbit that crosses the orbit of&nbsp;the Earth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the Earth and the meteorite had to reach the same&nbsp;point at the same time, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the timeline, Michail&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Petaev, senior scientist at the Center for Astrophysics, said that the slow, spiraling orbit of such a small object was very complex, as it was pulled by the gravity of “how many bodies we will never know.” But as Tissint was knocked loose, its freshly exposed surface began to be hit by cosmic rays, very high-energy particles from long-ago stellar explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The particles produced radioactive isotopes that decay at a known rate, Dr. Petaev said. These indicate the time since Tissint was knocked off Mars, or at least since its most recent major collision.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s evening in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stars we have are dying, and we’re not making new ones the way we used to. A group of British and American astronomers recently reported[http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3436] that the birthrate of stars in the universe has declined precipitously and continuously over the last 11 billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The universe today is only producing stars one-thirtieth as fast as it was at its peak in the lusty primordial days when protogalaxies, all gas and spume, were bouncing around like pups in a closet, colliding and merging, popping with blazing bright new stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news release[http://www.roe.ac.uk/roe/support/pr/pressreleases/20121107-cosmic_gdp/index.html] issued by the Royal Astronomical Society[http://www.ras.org.uk/], the astronomer David Sobral[http://www.roe.ac.uk/~drss/SOBRAL/Welcome.html] of Leiden University in the Netherlands said, “You might say that the universe has been suffering from a long, serious crisis: cosmic G.D.P. output is now only 3 percent of what it used to be at the peak in star production.” Dr. Sobral and his colleagues published their paper in the Monthly Notices of the <span class="companylink">Royal Astronomical Society</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They calculated that the current consolidation rate of “starstuff” into stars amounts to about a half a trillion tons per year per cubic light-year. The Sun[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/sun/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is about 2,000 trillion trillion tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a fundamental sense, this cosmic fatigue is not really new. Other surveys, including one led by the aptly named Alan Heavens[http://www.roe.ac.uk/~afh/] of the University of Edinburgh a few years ago, have come to similar conclusions. But one detail of this new study hit me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sobral and his colleagues said that if this decline in breeding goes on, it means the universe has already made 95 percent of the star mass that it will ever make. As eternity goes on — and on and on — the cosmos, like Palm Springs, will be dominated by older and older stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no cause for immediate alarm. Stars live for millions or billions of years, depending on their masses; the biggest burn out quickly, while the smaller ones can limp on as red dwarfs for a trillion years or more. The Sun, a middle-size and middle-aged star, has another 5 billion years or so to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our own Milky Way galaxy, moreover, is still busily hatching stars out of dense gas clouds in places like the Eagle Nebula[http://hubblesite.org/gallery/tours/tour-m16/], home of the famous Pillars of Creation[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/herschel/news/herschel20120118.html]. If you ever agonized about missing out on Paris in the 1920s or Italy in the Renaissance, at least you can take comfort that we live in the Golden Age of the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To paraphrase Bob Dylan, it’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news brought me back to the darkening days of November in the Catskills, where I used to live. When the woods suddenly become lighter and more transparent because branches are bare, the sun slants off silvery tree trunks. The ground is luminous, carpeted with red and gold leaves that are about to be buried in snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that 95 percent of the stars that will ever shine have already shone reminded me that I had once read that 6 percent of all the humans that have ever lived are alive today. The latter statistic[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-living-outnumber-dead] is a consequence of the exponential growth of the human race (and, if it keeps growing, could eventually create problems for the idea of reincarnation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might not think it has anything to do with the stars. But philosophers and cosmologists have wondered if there is an answer to the question of why we live where and when we do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cartoon history that they would like to tell goes like this: Coming out of the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago, the universe consisted of hydrogen and helium and a little lithium. Our bodies are made of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and iron that had to be synthesized in thermonuclear reactions in successive generations of stars that went bang and seeded space and future stars with heavier elements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That took time. The Milky Way was born near the height of the star baby boom, about 10 billion years ago. The Sun and solar system, with its heady mix of life-ready elements, came into being 4.5 billion years ago. It took evolution another 3.8 billion years to make us, the putative princelings of the cosmos. Could it all have happened faster to someone else some place else? Nobody knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody knows for sure, either, why cosmic star production has slowed down, the astronomers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, they have found evidence that some of the more violent denizens of the modern cosmos, like giant black holes and supernova explosions, can create powerful winds that blow the gas out of galaxies, preventing it from condensing into stars. One black hole in the galaxy NGC 1275[http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100604.html] was found to be “singing,” or belching pressure waves,[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/science/music-of-the-heavens-turns-out-to-sound-a-lot-like-a-b-flat.html] to the tune of a B flat 57 octaves below middle C, thus squelching star formation over much of the entire Perseus cluster — hundreds of galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some theorists, notably Freeman Dyson[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html] of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, have suggested ways that life could go on past the twilight of the stars, by extracting energy from black holes, for example. But that was before astronomers discovered that dark energy[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/01/science/the-end-of-everything.html] — what appears to be a sort of cosmic antigravity — is speeding up the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this continues, the future is really dark. Eventually the universe will be expanding so fast that most other galaxies will disappear from view forever. Eventually even atoms could be ripped apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time for bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the universe seems to me like one of those black-humored toys: a box with a button. When you push the button, a hand comes out 14 billion years later and turns the button off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 21, 2012, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the birthrate of stars in the universe misstated the sound made by pressure waves coming out of a black hole in the galaxy NGC 1275. The sound is that of a B flat 57 octaves below middle C, not 27 octaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 22, 2012, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the birthrate of stars in the universe misstated the rate of star production today.

It is not a million tons per year per cubic light-year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By NICOLA CLARK   </div><div>961 words</div><div>20 November 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The International Herald Tribune</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- Forty years after humans last walked on the Moon, Europe's space industry is hoping to play a key role in the resumption of manned lunar exploration planned for later this decade. But whether cash-strapped governments are prepared to pay for out-of-this-world projects remains unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science ministers from the 20 member states of the European Space Agency gather Tuesday in Naples for a two-day meeting where they will be asked to approve a budget of up to €12 billion, or $15.3 billion, for the next three years that would include financing for dozens of programs, including a new lunar crew transport vehicle, at least two Mars exploration missions and a successor to Europe's highly successful Ariane 5 rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the U.S. space agency, NASA, had a budget of $18 billion for the 2012 fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not living on a different planet,'' Jean-Jacques Dordain, the E.S.A.'s director general, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters here. ''I know the difficulties of people. I read the newspapers. The economic situation will have an impact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the global economic crisis struck four years ago, the E.S.A. had been able to count on steady increases to its annual budget, which today stands at just over €4 billion. But industry executives predict that the fiscal and deficit pact forged this year to save the euro will most likely require several member states to reduce their financing of space programs. Mr. Dordain said he hoped the ministers in Naples would approve a budget of at least €10 billion through 2015 -- an average of €3.3 billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The E.S.A.'s origins date from the late 1960s as the European countries with significant space expertise -- particularly Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- began to fear being left behind as the United States and Soviet Union channeled enormous financial and technological resources into their Cold War space race. The agency receives three-fourths of its budget directly from member states and the rest from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and a handful of cooperating states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, more than 30,000 people are directly employed by the space industry and a further 300,000 people work in space-related sectors like satellite operations and an array of navigation, communications and Earth observation services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of Mr. Dordain's mission this week will be to reassure governments that the often high upfront costs of the E.S.A.'s projects, which focus heavily on developing and launching satellites for earth observation and telecommunications, deliver tangible gains for European businesses. The <span class="companylink">European Union</span> estimates, for example, that the €5 billion Galileo satellite navigation system -- a competitor to the Global Positioning System of the United States -- will generate €90 billion in economic benefits over the next 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European companies have a 40 percent share of the global market in commercial satellite launchings, and economists say the revenue they generate is roughly 20 times the cost of the launchings themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space investment, Mr. Dordain said, ''is not the man on the moon -- it is down to earth.'' While the E.S.A. has always made its main priority the pursuit of knowledge about the Earth and the solar system, the current crisis has added another: leveraging space investments to enhance the competitiveness of European companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a message, he said, that some European governments are coming to grasp. This month, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced plans to increase London's contribution to the E.S.A.'s budget by 25 percent over the next two years. The larger contribution is expected to translate into more research contracts for British companies, the fruits of which could be commercialized into new products and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most audacious space-exploration missions have yielded technologies that have later found earthbound applications in areas like mobile communications, optics, robotics, energy generation and propulsion systems. That remains the main argument for continued European participation in projects like the International Space Station and forthcoming missions to the Moon, Mars and Mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most ambitious project on Mr. Dordain's wish list is a €450 million proposal to build, together with NASA, a space vehicle that would transport up to four astronauts on missions as long as six months. Its first mission, envisioned for around 2020, would bring the first humans to the Moon since the U.S. Apollo space program ended in 1972. The spacecraft could be modified in later years for manned missions to Mars or one of the asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other proposals on the table this week include €100 million to finance the first phase of development for a robotic lander that would explore the Moon's south pole, which some scientists believe may harbor ancient deposits of ice. An initial feasibility study for the lander was awarded in 2010 to Astrium, a unit of <span class="companylink">European Aeronautic Defense &amp; Space</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have more ideas than member states have money,'' Mr. Dordain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rocket scientist who has trained as an astronaut, Mr. Dordain, 66, was in primary school when the Soviet Union lofted Sputnik in 1957. He earned his engineering degree on July 20, 1969, the day Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he continues to press the case for space investment to European leaders, he concedes that it is impossible to put a price tag on the thrill of exploration that inspired his own career -- and that the E.S.A. aims to harness by encouraging young Europeans to become scientists and engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You cannot put an economic value on providing dreams,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - While European government chiefs were grandstanding in Brussels this week in what turned out to be a vain attempt to hammer out a common budget[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/world/europe/european-union-budget-talks-collapse.html?ref=europe], their science ministers were quietly celebrating a deal to secure Europe's prospects in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At ministerial negotiations in Naples[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2739/news/europe-sets-modest-goals-for-space-1.11878] of the 20-member European Space Agency (E.S.A), the usually parsimonious British actually agreed to contribute extra funds to ensure Europe's place in deep space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Germany and France, in a spirit of compromise that was sorely lacking in Brussels, ironed out their differences on upgrading Europe's workhorse Ariane rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As European space chiefs hailed the outcome of the November 21-22 meeting, Jean-Jacques Dordain, the E.S.A.'s director-general, said the level of funding agreed was a significant achievement[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20424858] given current economic difficulties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Praising the agreement to spend €10.1 billion, or $13 billion, on space exploration over the next three to five years, Mr. Dordain said: "Member states recognize that space is not an expense, it's an investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful deal[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMMRH91M9H_index_0.html], which was slightly less than Europe's space officials wanted but at least matched current spending, was a recognition that the economies of European states could ultimately lose out if scientific research is slashed in an era of austerity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Willetts, the British science minister, announcing an extra £300 million ($480 million) contribution[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/09/britain-science-spending-idUSL5E8M98XH20121109] to the E.S.A. earlier this month, said: "It will drive growth, create extra skilled jobs and help the U.K. to realize its ambition to have a £30 billion space industry by 2030."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the Naples deal, Britain agreed[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1211/22mpcv/#.ULCI0oZTBEI] for the first time to put money into a manned spaceflight program by agreeing to fund a European project to provide the propulsion unit for NASA's new manned capsule, Orion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of a Franco-German compromise[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/european-space-agency-agrees-to-further-develop-ariane-rockets-a-868552.html], the E.S.A. will continue to pursue Germany's preferred option for an upgraded version of the Ariane, the Ariane 5ME, which can carry heavier payloads and put them into higher orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Naples meeting also agreed to fund France's favored solution to build a new Ariane 6 that it says would be cheaper to launch and more competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not talking about victories," said Johann-Dietrich Wörner, chairman of the German space agency. "We are talking about European solutions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funding agreed this week pegs spending at current euro levels, so space development will lose out in real terms and some projects will have to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy, France, Spain and Britain had already decided not to participate[http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1211/20moonlander/#.ULCngYZTBEI] in a German-sponsored lunar lander project before the Naples meeting, meaning the E.S.A. will have to shelve plans for an unmanned landing on the south pole of the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Naples meeting may have been good news for space fans and European aerospace, but scientists remain concerned about the overall impact of budgetary restraint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Guardian newspaper reported this week[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/nov/23/europe-warned-science-budget-cuts] that some of the world's leading research organizations had written to warn José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, that cuts to the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> science budget would threaten the Continent's economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European heads of state were supposed to make a decision on science funding this week. But, as a result of the Brussels budget debacle, that is just one more decision that will have to wait.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE oceans have risen and fallen throughout Earth's history, following the planet's natural temperature cycles. Twenty thousand years ago, what is now New York City was at the edge of a giant ice sheet, and the sea was roughly 400 feet lower. But as the last ice age thawed, the sea rose to where it is today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we are in a new warming phase, and the oceans are rising again after thousands of years of stability. As scientists who study sea level change and storm surge, we fear that Hurricane Sandy gave only a modest preview of the dangers to come, as we continue to power our global economy by burning fuels that pollute the air with heat-trapping gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer, a disconcerting new scientific study by the climate scientist Michiel Schaeffer and colleagues -- published in the journal Nature Climate Change -- suggested that no matter how quickly we cut this pollution, we are unlikely to keep the seas from climbing less than five feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than six million Americans live on land less than five feet above the local high tide. (Searchable maps and analyses are available at SurgingSeas.org for every low-lying coastal community in the contiguous United States.) Worse, rising seas raise the launching pad for storm surge, the thick wall of water that the wind can drive ahead of a storm. In a world with oceans that are five feet higher, our calculations show that New York City would average one flood as high as Hurricane Sandy's about every 15 years, even without accounting for the stronger storms and bigger surges that are likely to result from warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Floods reaching five feet above the current high tide line will become increasingly common along the nation's coastlines well before the seas climb by five feet. Over the last century, the nearly eight-inch rise of the world's seas has already doubled the chance of ''once in a century'' floods for many seaside communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We hope that with enough time, most of our great coastal cities and regions will be able to prepare for a five-foot increase. Some will not. Barriers that might work in Manhattan would be futile in South Florida, where water would pass underneath them by pushing through porous bedrock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dr. Schaeffer's study, immediate and extreme pollution cuts -- measures well beyond any discussion now under way -- could limit sea level rise to five feet over 300 years. If we stay on our current path, the oceans could rise five feet by the first half of next century, then continue rising even faster. If instead we make moderate shifts in energy and industry -- using the kinds of targets that nations have contemplated in international talks but have failed to pursue -- sea level could still climb past 12 feet just after 2300. It is hard to imagine what measures might allow many of our great coastal cities to survive a 12-foot increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WE might find comfort in the fact that this is just one set of projections, and projections are notoriously tough to get right. But a second study that also came out this past summer erases any such comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by the geochemist Andrea Dutton and published in the journal Science, the second paper uses deep history, not model projections, for clues to the future. About 125,000 years ago, before the last ice age, there was a warm period that lasted 10,000 to 15,000 years. It was perhaps a little warmer than today, but cooler than the temperatures that climate scientists expect later in this century without sharp pollution cuts. Dr. Dutton's research strongly reinforces a prior study led by one of us, which found that the warm-period sea levels rose roughly 20 to 30 feet higher than those of today. We just don't have a clear picture of how fast that could happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any sea level forecast must be interpreted carefully: things could be better, or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schaeffer study uses the relationship between global temperature and sea level over the past 1,000 years -- when it was cool, and the great ice sheets were generally stable -- to extrapolate over the next 300 years -- when it will be hot, and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may behave differently. Other scientific teams have tried the notoriously difficult task of forecasting ice sheet decay in physical detail, and this has tended to produce slower estimates of sea level rise than the Schaeffer team's method. But any projection is compromised by the fact that we are sending heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere far faster than anything the planet has seen for at least 55 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dutton study comes with caveats, too. Earth's orbit was different during the last warm period, bringing more sunshine to the Arctic and complicating the analogy with today. But today we are on a path to a planet that will be much hotter than it was in the period Dr. Dutton studied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two basic ways to protect ourselves from sea level rise: reduce it by cutting pollution, or prepare for it by defense and retreat. To do the job, we must do both. We have lost our chance for complete prevention; and preparation alone, without slowing emissions, would -- sooner or later -- turn our coastal cities into so many Atlantises.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">smelt •\ˈsmelt\• verb and noun verb: extract (metals) by heating</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">noun: small cold-water silvery fish that migrates between salt and fresh water</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The word smelt has appeared in 29 New York Times articles in the past year, including on April 24 in "In Pursuit of Riches, and Travelers' Supplies, in the Asteroid Belt"[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/science/space/in-pursuit-of-riches-and-travelers-supplies-in-the-asteroid-belt.html] by Kenneth Chang:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the asteroids are icy - up to 20 percent water - and the water could be drawn out by melting the ice. The water could be taken to supply stopovers for future astronauts or broken down into breathable oxygen or propellant for spacecraft on interplanetary missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other asteroids are rocky and metallic. A throng of robotic mining spacecraft could grind up pieces of the asteroid and smelt it to capture precious metals within.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Platinum - which is used for jewelry, electronics components and automobile catalytic converters - fetches about $1,500 an ounce these days, so a single spacecraft would not have to bring back a lot of it for the enterprise to make money. More common metals like iron could perhaps be used as raw materials in space factories, churning out spacecraft and other structures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not much is known about Makemake, a dwarf planet that circles the Sun beyond Pluto. But scientists got a closer glimpse of it last year, when it passed briefly in front of a star (an event called an occultation), and they report their findings in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, researchers believed that because the surface temperature of Makemake (pronounced MAH-keh MAH-keh) is heterogeneous, it might have an atmosphere. ''If you have some patches with a higher temperature, the ice melts and creates vapor,'' said an author of the new study, Noemi Pinilla-Alonso, a planetary scientist at the University of Tennessee. ''And with vapor the planet can develop an atmosphere around it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new measurements -- based on observations from multiple telescopes in different parts of South America -- indicate that Makemake, like another dwarf planet, Eris, does not have a significant atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers also determined that Makemake reflects about 77 percent of the Sun's light, comparable to the reflection made by dirty snow, and that it is flattened at both poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Makemake occupies a portion of the solar system with very few stars, so a stellar occultation is rare, Dr. Pinilla-Alonso said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that we could do this and record it with so many telescopes of different sizes is amazing,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars rover Curiosity has found something -- something noteworthy, in a pinch of Martian sand. But what is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists working on the mission who know are not saying. Outside of that team, lots of people are guessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intrigue started last week when John P. Grotzinger, the Mars mission's project scientist, told <span class="companylink">National Public Radio</span>: ''This data is going to be one for the history books. It's looking really good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he declined to say anything more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fossils? Living microbial Martians? Maybe the carbon-based molecules known as organics, which are the building blocks of life? That so much excitement could be set off by a passing hint reflects the enduring fascination of both scientists and nonscientists with Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could be all kinds of things,'' said Peter H. Smith, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who was the principal investigator for NASA's earlier Phoenix Mars mission but is not involved with Curiosity. ''If it's historic, I think it's organics. That would be historic in my book.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger and other Curiosity scientists will announce their latest findings on Monday in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do not expect pictures of Martians, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Webster, a spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which operates Curiosity, said the findings would be ''interesting'' rather than ''earthshaking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webster noted that ''a really big announcement,'' if one should occur, would most likely be made at NASA headquarters in Washington and not at an academic conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever is revealed will be linked to the work of Curiosity's sophisticated chemistry laboratory instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars -- SAM, for short. The rover's robotic arm dropped the first bit of sand and dust into the instrument on Nov. 9, and the scientists have been analyzing and contemplating ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main goals of SAM is to identify organic molecules, but it would be a big surprise for organics to show up in a first look at a sand sample selected more as a test exercise than with the expectation of a breakthrough discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity will be headed toward layers of clays, which could be rich in organics and are believed to have formed during a warm and wet era early in the planet's history. But Curiosity has months to drive before arriving at those locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Curiosity scientists have learned through experience that it pays to double-check their results before trumpeting them. An initial test of the Martian atmosphere by the same instrument showed the presence of methane, which would have been a major discovery, possibly indicating the presence of methane-generating microbes living on Mars today. But when the scientists ran the experiment again, the signs of methane disappeared, leading them to conclude that the methane found in the first test had come from air that the spacecraft had carried to Mars from its launching spot in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webster, who was present during the interview with <span class="companylink">NPR</span>, said Dr. Grotzinger had been talking more generally about the quality of data coming back from Curiosity and was not suggesting that the data contained a breakthrough surprise. ''I don't think he had in mind, 'Here's some particular chemical that's been found,' '' Mr. Webster said. ''That's not my impression of the conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, Curiosity chimed in: ''What did I discover on Mars? That rumors spread fast online. My team considers this whole mission 'one for the history books.' '' (The public information staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory writes the posts for the rover.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would not be the first time that rumors eclipsed the actual findings from Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, the Mars Odyssey orbiter found evidence of frozen reservoirs of water beneath the surface of Mars, leading to breathless rumors in the British press that the Bush administration was about to announce a commitment to send astronauts there within 20 years. The White House remained quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Smith, the Phoenix Mars scientist, had a similar experience in 2008 when Aviation Week reported, ''The White House has been alerted by NASA about plans to make an announcement soon on major new Phoenix lander discoveries concerning the 'potential for life' on Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The blogosphere lit up,'' Dr. Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a hastily arranged news conference, Dr. Smith revealed the actual news: chemicals known as perchlorates had been found in the soil. ''The public was not interested in that,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity's pinch of sand indeed contained organics, it would again revive the possibilities of life on Mars. For now, Curiosity scientists are still analyzing the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do want to temper expectations,'' said Mr. Webster, the spokesman. ''But then again, I don't know exactly what they're going to say they've found.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHOE SANG-HUN   </div><div>605 words</div><div>28 November 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/northkorea/index.html?8qa] has stepped up what could be preparations to launch a new rocket from its northwestern launching station in defiance of a United Nations ban, the satellite operator DigitalGlobe[http://www.digitalglobe.com/] said Tuesday, citing recent satellite imagery of the facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased activities at Sohae Satellite Launching Station in North Korea came months after the Unha-3 rocket, launched from the same site in April, disintegrated shortly after takeoff[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/world/asia/north-korea-launches-rocket-defying-world-warnings.html] and failed to put what North Korea claimed was a scientific satellite into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States and its allies condemned the launching as a violation of United Nations Security Council[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org] resolutions that banned North Korea from testing technology that could be used to develop long-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April launching led to the collapse of a February deal under which the United States promised to ship humanitarian aid in return for the North’s agreement to suspend nuclear and missile tests and uranium enrichment, and to allow United Nations monitors back into its main nuclear complex. North Korea has since vowed to continue to launch rockets carrying satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a post on its Web site, <span class="companylink">DigitalGlobe</span> cited satellite imagery taken last Friday to report “a marked increase in activity” at the North Korean launching site on the country’s west coast near China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This activity is consistent with launch preparations” before the failed April launching, it said. “Given the observed level of activity noted of a new tent, trucks, people and numerous portable fuel/oxidizer tanks — should North Korea desire — it could possibly conduct its fifth satellite launch event during the next three weeks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea, which carried out nuclear tests in 2006[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/world/asia/09korea.html] and 2009[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/world/asia/25nuke.html], considers itself a nuclear power. But there is doubt over its ability to deliver a nuclear payload atop its ballistic missiles. Since 1998, it has launched several long-range rockets, which the United States considered a cover for testing long-range missile technology. They all exploded in midair or failed in their stated purpose of putting satellites into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The activities at the North Korean launching site come as South Korea is preparing for a presidential election on Dec. 19. Japan is also scheduled to hold legislative elections election on Dec. 16[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/asia/japans-leader-agrees-to-hold-december-elections.html], and President Obama will be inaugurated for his second term in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, when there were changes of governments in the region, North Korea has often tried to draw attention to its nuclear and missile threats in a tactic that analysts believed was aimed at forcing the new governments to engage North Korea and possibly offer concessions. In the past, North Korea was also accused of using military provocations to influence elections in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported last week that American intelligence analysts had detected moves that were seen as preparations for a long-range rocket launching by North Korea. It said that cargo that appeared to be missile parts was moved in early November from a weapons factory in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to an assembly plant at the missile launching base, commonly known as Tongchang-ri, the town where it is located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, 38 North[http://38north.org/], a Web site affiliated with the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, cited satellite imagery that it said indicated that North Korea has been testing rocket engines there[http://38north.org/2012/11/sohae111212/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the United States and South Korea said they were closely watching the site, and they urged the North to refrain from testing long-range missiles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity, the NASA Mars rover, has not found the building blocks of life in that planet's dirt, the agency said Thursday. ''Rumors and speculation that there are major new findings from the mission at this early stage are incorrect,'' NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. Tamping down expectations about a news conference scheduled for Monday, NASA said, ''The instruments on the rover have not detected any definitive evidence of Martian organics.'' Speculation was fueled last week when the mission's project scientist told a reporter that data from Curiosity would be ''one for the history books.'' NASA later clarified that the scientist was speaking generally.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury is as cold as ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, possesses a lot of ice -- 100 billion to one trillion tons -- scientists working with NASA's Messenger spacecraft reported on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator for Messenger, said there was enough ice there to encase Washington, D.C., in a frozen block two and a half miles deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a counterintuitive discovery for a place that also ranks among the hottest in the solar system. At noon at the equator on Mercury, the temperature can hit 800 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But near Mercury's poles, deep within craters where the Sun never shines, temperatures dip to as cold as minus 370.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In these planetary bodies, there are hidden places, as it were, that can have interesting things going on,'' said David J. Lawrence, a senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory working on the Messenger mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings appear in a set of three papers published Thursday on the Web site of the journal Science. The ice could be an intriguing science target for a future robotic lander or even a resource for astronauts in the far future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists had strong hints of the ice a couple of decades ago when telescopes bounced radio waves off Mercury and the reflections were surprisingly bright. But some researchers suggested the craters could be lined with silicate compounds or sulfur, which might also be highly reflective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Messenger spacecraft, which swung into orbit around Mercury in March 2011 and has completed its primary mission, took a closer look by counting particles known as neutrons that are flying off the planet. High-energy cosmic rays break apart atoms, and the debris includes neutrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when a speeding neutron hits a hydrogen atom, which is almost the same weight, it comes to almost a complete stop, just as the cue ball in billiards transfers its momentum when it hits another ball. Water molecules contain two hydrogen atoms, and thus when Messenger passed over ice-rich areas, the number of neutrons dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same technique was used to detect frozen water below the surface on Mars and within similar craters on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neutron number would not have dropped if the bright surfaces had been made of sulfur or silicates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Water ice is the only candidate we've got that fits all those observations,'' said Dr. Solomon, who is also director of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ice is almost pure water, which indicates that it arrived within the last few tens of millions of years, possibly from a comet that smacked into Mercury. Dr. Solomon said several young craters on the surface of Mercury could be candidates for such an impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the icy regions were bright. In slightly warmer regions, where temperatures exceed minus 280, the ice was covered by a dark layer about half a foot thick. The scientists believe in these places the water ice vaporized, leaving behind other materials that had been trapped, including carbon-based molecules known as organics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be similar to how water and the building blocks of life reached Earth billions of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water could also be an intriguing resource for people. Between the scorched equator and the frozen poles, temperatures on Mercury can be temperate, especially a few feet below the surface, where the soil insulates against the temperature swings between day and night -- an ideal location to build a colony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People joke about it, but it's not so crazy, really,'' said David A. Paige, a professor of geology at U.C.L.A. who calculated the crater temperatures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Kumar[http://www.alexanderkumar.com/], a physician and researcher at Concordia Station, writes from Antarctica, where he conducts scientific experiments for the European Space Agency's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Lao-Tzu who said[http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/laotzu134481.html], "For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past century, we have had several world wars, seen man take his first juvenile steps on the Moon and bore witness to the discovery and trail of devastation left by H.I.V./AIDS the world over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many argue and question why humans should venture out to other planets, and perhaps in the process create new problems, when we have so many problems on our own planet. Among other things, there is a potential for forward and backward contamination of Mars and Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have spent the majority of my time exploring the world we now share, trying to identify its shape and boundaries in hopes of better understanding the way it works and its problems -- and how I can best make a constructive and directed contribution. At 29, I am still learning, intrigued and curious to help find solutions to the world's problems. Furthermore I consider myself extremely fortunate to have had such unique opportunities to experience and see many beautiful areas and meet interesting people of the world, from the Amazon to the Arctic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antarctica has been my latest journey of discovery. I ventured down here to investigate the possibility of one day sending humans to Mars. Months ago, as the curtains of darkness were drawn, the world took on a different perspective -- distant, as if looking back at it from another planet. I pondered if we can go to Mars, when we will go to Mars[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19652324] and perhaps more importantly, if we should go to Mars[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19666057].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I have found through this difficult, challenging and unique experience, as I emerge from the snow-hole, has been as romantically depressing as it is inspiring -- a Shakespearean tragedy mixed in with beauty and experience, with an umbrella of humor poking out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a land so far removed from mankind that there has never been an aboriginal or indigenous population. We are only visiting specks, blown by the winds of time, living against a blank white canvas -- an area of the world God had either forgotten to paint or perhaps left intentionally blank to remind us of our insignificance. As this is the seventh continent, if this God took rest on the seventh day, perhaps it was just a question of running out of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While living here, I have been repeatedly asked by people from all over the world why the human race would invest its precious and finite resources (money) into space exploration? People have presented valid arguments both ways: those against, about depriving the bottom billion of our planet by diverting much-needed funding; and those in favor, for furthering mankind's now-desperate need for discoveries and new life-saving technology through exploration in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reader caught my attention, having e-mailed me about malaria as the basis to his argument -- a disease I had seen ravage equatorial communities from Africa to the Amazon. Their point was perfectly clear: according to the <span class="companylink">World Health Organization</span>, despite increased prevention and control measures that have led to a reduction in malaria mortality rates since 2000 by more than 25 percent globally, half the world's population remains at risk of malaria and an estimated 500,000 to more than 1 million people die from it each and every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is much more to it than that. W.H.O. reminds us that each year another 2 million die because of H.I.V./AIDS, another 1.5 million because of diarrhea-related illnesses and another million from tuberculosis -- all largely preventable and treatable diseases. Five leading causes of death in children under 5 are pneumonia, preterm birth complications, diarrhea, birth asphyxia and malaria. Maybe numbers speak louder than words -- or even the names of those less fortunate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such health inequality reminds me of the reasons I went into medicine and developed an interest in science and research. And fortunately, I now have first-hand experience after living on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the world's problems closely while pursuing a degree in International (Public) Health in 2006, I felt an air of excitement and focused energy toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals[http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/], adopted at the turn of this century as a vision for a better future. Currently 193 United Nations member states are working together to achieve these goals by 2015, in a promise to "free people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As our human population is expected to surpass eight billion by 2025, the world and its many inhabitants will face further challenges. And already it is clear that our planet has started to stretch, strain and buckle and unzip at its seams, with a gathering body of scientific evidence being unlocked from within the ice cores drilled beneath the chair I sat on while writing from Antarctica, alongside images of the marked retreat of the glaciers, now deserted by ice shelves the size of countries. In the next century we can expect food shortages to worsen, clean and ample water to become a commodity for the privileged, and our oceans to become acidified and over fished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mission Earth, the count down is on... 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Only time will tell what technological advances will be made in space that can be adapted to save humanity and cure the world's problems. The world lives in hope that this search will lead to a new renewable and clean energy supply that can meet our excessive demand -- and in turn prevent the realization of Thomas Malthus' predicted cataclysmal, apocalyptic end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A manned mission to Mars, leading to exploration and eventually habitation, could provide unforeseen benefits for mankind, from new technology to invention and innovation as evidenced by the benefits from the Apollo 11 and later lunar missions. A multi-trillion dollar investment could also certainly trigger economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malaria remains a political issue -- quite different from a Mars mission -- but requiring the same long term planning, dedication to resolution and financial and human investment. Simple donation is not the way to reach Mars or the way to cure malaria, where all the mosquito nets in the universe will not prevent or eradicate it. An old phrase told to me by my father, who was born in India says, "It would be better to teach a person how to go fishing rather than offering him some fish."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, developed countries, by integrating promising new discoveries from space-flight research, may be in a better position to help invest and fight the world's problems. And so could it not be true that problems like malaria, although in no way linked to Mars missions, could one day stand to benefit from such exploration -- and the seeds of inventions which accompany these endeavors grow and blossom beyond the wildest imaginations for the benefit of mankind?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is another question to ponder: Perhaps we will one day have no other option than to leave this planet. Should we start looking farther afield now, for a bigger home, in a better and safer area, with lower crime rates, in our race for space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, in the words of Lao-Tzu, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." And after all, just one small step for man may well be that "giant leap for mankind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think back to the words of the great British poet Sir Alfred Tennyson, which are engraved into a large, lonely wooden cross overlooking a path, in memory of explorers who sought the South Pole 100 years ago, which represented the uttermost end of the known world: "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To me, the greatest tragedy for mankind may lie in choosing not to strive or seek today's scientific bounty of discovery, whether in space, on Mars or in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Updated, 4:55 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO -- In a sand drift on Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover discovered ... sand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union[http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/] here, scientists working on the mission talked about the analysis of the first soil sample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John P. Grotzinger,[http://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/grotz/profile] the project scientist, inadvertently set off expectations of a major discovery when he told[http://www.npr.org/2012/11/20/165513016/big-news-from-mars-rover-scientists-mum-for-now] National Public Radio a couple of weeks ago that the data was "one for the history books."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Dr. Grotzinger said he was referring to the richness and quality of the data coming from Curiosity's sophisticated instruments on the soil sample, not that it contained a major discovery. Dr. Grotzinger and other Curiosity scientists said their analysis did not provide definitive evidence for the building blocks of life as some had speculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think certainly what I've learned from this is that you have to be careful about what you say and even more careful about how you say it," Dr. Grotzinger said. "We're doing science at the speed of science. We live in a world that's sort of at the pace of Instagrams."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, it was an unremarkable pinch of dirt, more to test the apparatus[http://www.space.com/16902-mars-rover-curiosity-life-building-blocks.html] than to make discoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The @MarsCuriosity has found a complex chemistry within the Martian soil! http://t.co/ReRnVWBL[http://t.co/ReRnVWBL]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- NASA (@NASA)[http://www.twitter.com/NASA]3 Dec 12[https://twitter.com/NASA/status/275651900567846912]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Edgett, principal investigator for a camera that takes close-up images, described the soil as fine sand. "It's very dry-looking stuff, just what you'd expect," he said. "The grain size is sort of like these artificial sweeteners in term of size, finer than sugar but coarser than something like flour. The surface of the drift was covered with coarser sand - more like the size of salt grains on those big hot pretzels you can get."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mineralogical composition was similar to that found by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers during their years of exploration elsewhere on Mars, suggesting that this sample can serve as baseline for what covers much of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars, or SAM for short, heated the dirt to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) and looked at the gases that escaped as the dirt burned. The most common gases were water vapor and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SAM instrument also detected chlorinated methane - a small, simple compound that falls in the category of organics, which are the building blocks of life. However, the scientists said it was much too early to say that the soil itself contained organics. The carbon could be vestiges of molecules that the spacecraft took to Mars from Earth, and the organics could have been generated by chemical reactions as the dirt was heated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the carbon could point to anything biological on Mars, "that's well down the road for us to get to," Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the complexities analyzing the voluminous data, "There's not going to be one single moment where we all stand up and on the basis of a single measurement have a hallelujah moment," Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chlorine points to the presence of chlorine compounds known as perchlorates that had been discovered in Mars's polar regions by the NASA's Phoenix Mars lander in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More esoteric measurements like the levels of heavy hydrogen in the rocks could give clues to the vanishing of Mars's atmosphere over billions of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists have now successfully deployed and tested almost all of Curiosity's instruments. The last piece to be deployed will be its drill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometime early next year we're going to pack it up and start driving toward Mount Sharp, which is the reason we picked this site," Dr. Grotzinger said. The base of the mountain contains layers of sedimentary rocks including clays that are more likely to contain organics. "We're ready for our trip, and that's when our science mission of exploration really gets in gear."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched 35 years ago to explore Jupiter and other planets, has not yet left the confines of the solar system for interstellar space -- but it is getting close, scientists said Monday. The spacecraft, which is more than 11 billion miles from Earth, has entered a ''magnetic highway,'' a new region of crisscrossing charged particles, some from the Sun and some from interstellar space. But researchers, speaking at a news briefing in Pasadena, Calif., said there was no indication of a change in the magnetic field that would indicate that Voyager had entered interstellar space itself. Edward Stone, a Voyager project scientist, said this new region may be the last layer before interstellar space, but it could take the spacecraft another two or three years to cross it. Voyager 1 is traveling about 11 miles a second; a companion craft, Voyager 2, is not quite as far from the Sun and is traveling slower, less than 10 miles a second.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will launch its next robotic rover to Mars in the summer of 2020, agency officials announced on Tuesday. The $1.5 billion rover would largely reuse the same design as the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in August. This is the last piece in a revamped program that NASA put together after withdrawing from collaborations with the European Space Agency to launch two Mars missions in 2016 and 2018 because of budget constraints. NASA has since announced plans to launch a lander in 2016 that will study Mars' interior by listening to seismic waves rumbling through the ground. On Tuesday, NASA also announced that it would again participate in the Europeans' 2016 and 2018 missions, but on a more limited scale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EMMITSBURG, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these times of upset and uncertainty, comfort comes in knowing that dental floss can cut a dense cheesecake more cleanly than any knife. That cloves of garlic will send ants scurrying. That a cow requires at least 15 pounds of hay per day. That the state bird of South Dakota is the ring-necked pheasant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 217th consecutive year, useful facts and tips like these have been assembled in J. Gruber's Hagerstown Town and Country Almanack, a deceptively slim volume that is available to farmers, merchants and all good citizens -- especially those residing in the Middle Atlantic States -- at the nominal cost of $4.99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contained within its 82 pages is the accumulated wisdom of many generations of farmers who lived and worked according to the arc of the sun and the pull of the moon. This means that in addition to reporting that our nation's fifth vice president was Elbridge Gerry and that the gift of a daffodil represents unrequited love, Gruber's Almanack also provides ''conjecture of the weather and other astronomical information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, if you want to know what weather to expect in New England next Thanksgiving Day, the almanac offers an answer with a better-than-even shot at accuracy: ''Snow, heavy south.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the educated guess of Bill O'Toole, 70, a retired college math professor who, for more than four decades, has served as the almanac's seventh prognosticator -- or conjecturer, or calculator -- a line of work that began in 1797 with a star-savvy blacksmith. Mr. O'Toole is tall and bearded, with large eyes that convey wonder in all things, and a business card that declares in black and white his gray-area profession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from desk space carved out of the book clutter of a brick row house here in Emmitsburg, about a mile south of the Pennsylvania line, Mr. O'Toole endeavors to divine the weather as much as 18 months in advance. He does so with a conjurer's brew of age-old wisdom and 21st-century technology that includes a range of tools, from a software program of astronomical data produced by the <span class="companylink">United States Naval Observatory</span> to the meticulous tracking -- through some 30 computer programs he has written -- of all things lunar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon matters, Mr. O'Toole says, as people who work the land discovered long ago. ''They noticed a trend,'' he says. ''When the moon changed phase close to midnight, the weather over the next lunar week, between six and nine days, would be fair, agreeable, calm. But it was just the opposite if it occurred close to noon: snowy, rainy, stormy, disagreeable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After completing his calculations, Mr. O'Toole charts his predictions on postcard-size weather maps of the continental United States, drawing a map for every week. Here, then, a test: Did the prognosticator foretell Sandy, the fall's calamitous superstorm?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He points to a blue-ink swirl that he drew on one of those small maps. In June 2011. ''Tropical storm from Atlantic,'' the Almanack predicted -- somewhat prematurely, it turned out. ''I was off by a week and a few days,'' he says. ''Not too bad, considering this was done 16 months earlier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Toole ignores the occasional charge of quackery. He says that a person could predict the weather 25 percent of the time by simply throwing darts at a board, but that he shoots for better than 50 percent. And, in the annual ''Conjecturer's Column'' that he writes for the almanac, he is nothing if not candid about his performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Daily forecasts for the mid-Atlantic region were correct 55.1 percent of the time, slightly below last year's 59.3 percent, which was the best in recent years,'' Mr. O'Toole wrote in the current almanac. ''The worst month for daily forecasts was October at 38.7 percent; the best was May, clocking in at 72.6 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Toole grew up in nearby Waynesboro, Pa. His father, William, was a toolmaker and sales representative, his mother, Dora, a homemaker and parish secretary who had grown up on a dairy farm. After she died at 91 last year, Mr. O'Toole found a diary in which his mother had faithfully recorded the weather every day for nearly 70 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High 76 degrees; rain; bright moonlit night...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A deeply ingrained tradition among farmers,'' he explained. A small way of trying to make sense of the natural world by those so grounded in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Toole was a boy so drawn to the moon and the stars that in high school he helped to establish an amateur astronomy club. After flirting with the idea of a career in astronomy, he graduated from Mount St. Mary's University here, and promptly joined its math department as a teacher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then one day in 1969, he says, he received a call from ''out of the blue'' (a hoary expression that refers to the sky). It was the business manager of Gruber's Almanack, and he wanted to know: Are you familiar with our publication?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally published in German, then German and English, then only in English when German became a dead-to-me language during World War I, the Gruber Almanack was as much a part of the local universe as Jupiter and Saturn. You'd punch a hole in the top left corner, hang it on a string, and consult it for -- well, as the almanac puts it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rising, setting, and Eclipses of the Sun and Moon; the phases, places, and southing of the Moon; the aspects of the planets; the rising, setting, and southing of the most conspicuous planets and fixed stars; the equation of time; with a variety of useful and entertaining matter, anecdotes, &amp;c., &amp;c.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business manager went on to explain that the almanac's sixth prognosticator had passed away, and it was in need of its seventh. Was Mr. O'Toole interested?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He inherited his predecessor's charts and notes and, before long, was using the lunar cycle and other variables to recommend the best days to plant, to weed, to harvest -- even to go fishing (May 30 next year is good, for example, but May 31 is better).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The almanac has been passed on through the generations within the same family. These days it is owned and produced by three men driven more by loyalty than by money: Mr. O'Toole, a retired professor, is the prognosticator; Jerry Spessard, 63, a retired insurance agent and part-time inventor, is the longtime business manager; and Charles W. Fisher Jr., 63, a retired sales executive, is the editor and great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Johann Gruber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, circulation has waxed and waned -- it now is about 85,000 -- but the readership remains fully engaged. Mr. Spessard often receives calls about sweet recollections of a grandmother's reliance on the almanac, as well as angry complaints about a typographical error that might disrupt the spin of the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the earth continues to spin, and J. Gruber's Hagerstown Town and Country Almanack continues to advise and to console. Dental floss can also be used as an emergency shoelace. The state flower of Maryland is the black-eyed Susan. And if you plan to be in the mid-Atlantic next Memorial Day, the prognosticator suggests that you might want to pack an umbrella.</p>
<p>Bill O'Toole, near his home in Emmitsburg, Md. A retired math professor, he has served for more than 40 years as the prognosticator of a 217-year-old almanac.; Mr. O'Toole makes predictive weather maps to help compile  data for his predictions, made up to 18 months in advance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO — While many obsessed over speculation that NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s newest Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rover, Curiosity, had dug up signs of life — it had not[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/mars-rover-discovery-revealed/] — it is the agency’s older, smaller jalopy, Opportunity, that has been exploring a more intriguing plot of Martian real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is our first glimpse ever at conditions on ancient Mars that clearly show us a chemistry that would have been suitable for life,” Steven W. Squyres[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/nac/members/squyres-bio.html], the principal investigator for Opportunity, said at a news conference last week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union[http://sites.agu.org/] here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity could be sitting on rocks chock-full of organic molecules — but the rover and the scientists back on Earth would never know. Unlike Curiosity, Opportunity is not carrying instruments that can detect those kinds of molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the scientists are not complaining. Everything from Opportunity over the past eight years has been a bonus for a mission that was to have ended long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, for what was supposed to be a three-month mission. Yet the rover continues operating in good condition. (Its twin, Spirit, died in 2010[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/science/space/25rover.html], stuck in a sand trap and unable to point its solar arrays in the correct direction to survive winter, outliving its planned lifetime by almost six years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Opportunity arrived at a 14-mile-wide crater named Endeavour, where NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted clays from above. Clays generally form in the presence of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clay signal pointed to a hill, which the scientists named after Jacob Matijevic, an engineer on the rover team who died this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Opportunity approached, “We started seeing things that looked really, really different,” Dr. Squyres said. The most common rock there was light-colored, fine-grained, very soft, and nothing like any that Opportunity had come across before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is right in the sweet spot of where the clay signature is present,” Dr. Squyres said. “It has got to be the clay-bearing stuff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the rover looked at the elements in the rock, it was the same mix of elements in a typical Martian rock. “What’s unusual is that it’s not unusual,” Dr. Squyres said. “This puzzled us at first. I was expecting something dramatic and instead what you see here kind of looks like average Mars.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another instrument could have identified minerals in the rock, but the radioactive cobalt it relies on has long decayed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity were at the Endeavour crater, its instruments could directly look for the carbon-based molecules known as organics that are the building blocks of life. But Curiosity, which landed in August, is more than 5,000 miles away exploring a different crater where clays have also been spotted from orbit — and it is still months away from reaching there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its nearly nine years on Mars, Opportunity has driven more than 22 miles, crossing a Martian plain and stopping by several smaller craters. During its travels, it came across minerals that pointed to flowing water in Mars’ past, but these minerals formed in highly acidic conditions. “Battery acid kind of numbers,” Dr. Squyres said. “And that’s a challenging place for life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clays only form in more benign conditions. “The thing that’s different here is that these clay minerals point towards a neutral chemistry — water you can drink,” Dr. Squyres said. “And that’s a different story, a different world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These rocks appear to date to the early warm and wet era of Mars, perhaps when the planet was more hospitable to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Opportunity took a look at another outcrop on Matijevic Hill made of darker, harder minerals. Close up, it saw tiny spheres embedded in the rocks, similar in appearance to iron-rich spheres nicknamed “blueberries” that the rover had observed earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except these did not contain much iron. “These are something totally different,” Dr. Squyres said. “I’ve been calling them newberries, because there’s something new.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though Opportunity cannot find organics, Dr. Squyres said there were many questions that it would be able to answer that would tell scientists what this part of early Mars was like. What are the newberries made of? How did they form? Did wind or water shape the rocks of Matijevic Hill?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity will spend several months at Matijevic Hill to try to unravel as many of these puzzles as it can, using its remaining instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we have stumbled upon here at Matijevic Hill, drawn here by that clay signature, is what’s turning out to be one of the most delightful geologic puzzles that we have ever found with this rover on Mars,” Dr. Squyres said. “It’s fascinating. It’s a work in progress.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her excellent 2011 collection, ''Life on Mars,'' the poet Tracy K. Smith writes of ''seeing the high beams of a million galaxies flick on at twilight.'' That's the kind of wonder I felt as Michael Benson's ''Planetfall'' carried me away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson is a filmmaker, writer and photographer who specializes in letting the reader reach escape velocity from the terrestrial comfort of an easy chair. His previous books -- both from Abrams -- include ''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes'' (2003) and ''Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle'' (2009).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His goal in ''Planetfall,'' he writes, is to present ''a retrospective look at the visual legacy of 21st-century space exploration.'' Mr. Benson reminds us that it has been just 50 years since the first spacecraft waltzed with another planet, when an American Mariner probe dipped past Venus in December 1962. He then takes us on an interplanetary pleasure cruise that stretches from the Sun to Saturn. All retrospectives, art and otherwise, should shock us awake the way this one does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense, Mr. Benson has scrapbooked an up-to-date album of our solar system using mostly primary-image data from NASA and European Space Agency missions from 2000 to 2012. And so, among dozens of striking images, we're privileged to see Earthrise on the Moon and the restless sand seas of Mars; sunspots in bloom and the cryptic moons of Jupiter; and the rings of Saturn looking like the cosmic grooves of a very long-playing album.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson's first definition of the word planetfall is ''the act or instance of sighting a planet after a space voyage.'' And one of the delights here is that the reader makes planetfall too, joining the community of camera-bearing, spacefaring robots and their human handlers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dynamics of observing are complex. In these photos we're not just gazing at lunar barrens and the dunes and lakes of Titan, a moon of Saturn, but also, in a sense, looking at ourselves, turning the solar system into a mirror of human achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subtext of these images is our guts and intelligence as a species able to secure such photographs, in willing ourselves into outer space. We weren't invited to the vast celestial prom, but we went anyway. From ancient times, the cosmos have colonized our inner space, but now we can abandon land rovers on Mars, blithely building our very own Martian junkyards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting at that tension, Mr. Benson quotes the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg to good effect: ''We have to remember that what we see is not nature herself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a book full of startling photographs -- I gasped at the images of the Sun, the heat rising off the page making me feel as if something inside me were melting -- the one that stunned me the most was taken in November 2006 by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter of frosted southern dunes on Mars in winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a three-page gatefold spread those dunes are as lush as an Edward Weston bodyscape and make me want to shout Cézanne, Picasso, Tanguy all at once. But this abstract and alien Mars-scape is real, not a bug-eyed monster in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Planetfall'' is a book of science through and through, but it also deepens our sense of the miracle and the mystery of the universe, of our eye-blink lives. We're all bundled in bewilderment on this little blue bungalow between Mars and Venus, but Mr. Benson has given us a cozy front porch, a fine place from which to watch Ms. Smith's high beams of a million galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A show based on ''Planetfall'' will be on view Jan. 24 to March 9 at the Hasted Kraeutler Gallery, 537 West 24th Street, in Manhattan.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHOE SANG-HUN   </div><div>530 words</div><div>14 December 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea -- The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, personally supervised the successful launching of a three-stage rocket this week, and ordered his government to launch more rockets despite criticism from <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> Security Council, the North's official news media reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kim sent a personally signed approval for North Korean scientists to launch the rocket on Wednesday, and later visited a control center outside Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to oversee the procedure, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's dispatch was monitored by the South Korean news agency <span class="companylink">Yonhap</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North's Unha-3 rocket blasted off from a launching site in northwestern North Korea on Wednesday and put a satellite into orbit. The success provided a propaganda boon for Mr. Kim in his efforts to build his image as a young yet competent leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching ''cemented our position as a space technology powerhouse by indisputably demonstrating that our nation has climbed the pinnacle of world-class advanced technology,'' Mr. Kim was quoted as saying, adding that the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite was ''built with our technology and wisdom alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North's ''peaceful space program'' resulted from its policy of ''developing scientific technology and the economy,'' Mr. Kim said. ''We must continue to launch satellites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">South Korean Defense Ministry</span> said Thursday that the satellite was orbiting at a speed of 4.7 miles per second, though it was not known whether it was functioning normally. Its mission is unclear, though North Korean space officials have said the satellite will be used to study crops and weather patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Security Council called the launching a violation of <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> resolutions that ban the country from ''any launch using ballistic missile technology,'' and said it would consider an ''appropriate response.'' Washington and its allies say the real purpose of the North Korean rocket program has less to do with putting satellites into orbit than with mastering the technology needed to deliver a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By stressing Mr. Kim's personal involvement in the rocket program, the North Korean media was apparently trying to bolster Mr. Kim's leadership. North Korea, hardly able to feed its people without outside aid, considers its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs the pride of its ''military first'' policy, and has been crediting Mr. Kim as a key supporter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While supervising the 2009 launching of a long-range rocket, Mr. Kim ''determined to enter a war if the enemies dared to intercept'' the rocket, official media reported at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Thursday, South Korean officials said they were closely monitoring the North's main nuclear test site in northeastern North Korea for signs of a third test. The country conducted an underground nuclear test in 2006 and again in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said the timing of another test was a political rather than a technical decision. In recent months, international experts analyzing satellite imagery of the site have reported tunneling activities there. But they reported no indications of an imminent underground test.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDNASA's latest Moon mission will end on Monday -- not with a whimper, but a splat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two splats, actually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ebb and Flow, two space probes the size of washing machines that have been orbiting the Moon and measuring its gravity field, will perform an orchestrated death plunge on Monday, crashing into the body's dark side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exercise will not be for the advance of science, but rather something of a garbage-disposal operation, to make sure that the probes -- which are running out of fuel -- do not come to rest in a historically significant place, like on Neil Armstrong's footprints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon has been affronted this way many times before, especially during the space race of the 1960s, but NASA is now trying to dispose of its litter more carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the first impact will come 40 seconds past 5:38 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Dec. 17 when Ebb slams into a mountain near the Moon's north pole at 3,760 miles per hour. The second, from Ebb's twin, Flow, will come 20 seconds later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, since the action will happen on the dark side of the Moon, there will be nothing for earthlings to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not expecting a flash that is visible from Earth,'' Maria T. Zuber, the mission's primary investigator, said Thursday during a telephone news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is all by design as NASA wraps up its Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission, or Grail, for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To map the gravity, the two spacecraft are in an orbit passing over the Moon's north and south poles. They pass over all parts of the lunar surface as the Moon rotates below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the probes' fuel ran out and their orbits decayed, they could crash anywhere on the Moon, including a slim chance -- eight in one million -- that one of them could obliterate those famous footprints or another historic site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the spacecraft guided into a mountain, the chances are zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in their demise, however, Ebb and Flow may be able to aid the cause of science. Another of NASA's spacecraft, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, will pass over the crash sites, and scientists hope that they will be able to tell something about the mountain -- which is a remnant of a crater rim -- from the gouges created by Ebb and Flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what the crash might look like to someone standing there, David Lehman, the project manager for Grail, said, ''It'll be like a washing machine landing on top of you, and it'll be a very bad day for you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in September 2011, the two spacecraft slipped into lunar orbit at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the primary mission, the two spacecraft orbited at an altitude of 34 miles. Wobbles in the distance between them told of variations in the Moon's gravitational field. For example, the gravity would be stronger when the spacecraft passed over a mountain field or a clump of dense minerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Ebb and Flow, scientists now have more precise measurements of the Moon's gravity than of the Earth or any other planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the primary mission was completed, the two spacecraft were nudged to a lower altitude of 14 miles -- for more precise measurements -- and then, on Dec. 6, even lower to 6.6 miles. But maintaining that low altitude depleted the maneuvering fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the Grail mission already has shown that the Moon's crust is thinner than had been thought, and that it was pulverized by impacts during the early history of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon's density, deduced from the gravity, places constraints on what it could be made of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Dr. Zuber said, the Moon appears to contain the same abundance of aluminum as the Earth, supporting the theory that the Moon was formed out of a cataclysmic collision of a Mars-size body and the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data so far does not support a hypothesis that the Earth once had two Moons that later collided and combined into one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravity data could also help future travelers, human and robotic, navigate to a precise location on the Moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This actually decreases the costs of future exploration of the Moon,'' Dr. Zuber said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 15, 2012, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about NASA's plan to crash two space probes into the moon misstated part of the formal name of a NASA mission.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ebb and Flow are no more. The two spacecraft of NASA's Grail mission crashed on the Moon at about 5:28 p.m. Eastern time, about 30 seconds apart, one of the few times that cheers and claps have been heard in the control room to celebrate the loss of a spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced it had named the impact sites after Sally Ride, the first American woman in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crashes into a lunar mountain brought the yearlong mission to map the Moon's gravity field to an end. The twin spacecraft were running low on maneuvering fuel, and NASA wanted to make sure that they did not accidentally destroy a historical site like one of the Apollo landings -- ­ unlikely, but possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA broadcast live commentary of the impacts on its Web site, but provided no live video showing the probes hitting the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my article last week about the impending demise of Ebb and Flow, I noted, ''Unfortunately, since the action will happen on the dark side of the Moon, there will be nothing for earthlings to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a gazillion people, including Robert Kirshner, a Harvard astronomy professor, wrote in to ask, ''Didn't you mean to write 'far side' and not 'dark side'?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more annoyed wrote: ''Dark Side of the Moon??? Come on now. You know that is not correct! You completely blew a potential teaching moment, to educate the public that the **FAR** side of the Moon is **NOT** dark! Instead you perpetuated yet another scientific misconception. No wonder we are facing a crisis in science literacy in the U.S. The New York Times can and should do better!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except I really meant, ''dark side'' ­ -- the side of the Moon facing away from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was confusing to many was a remembered tidbit about the Moon, that there is always one face towards Earth, and the other always out of view, and they presumed that the crashes will be on the far side and therefore blocked from view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that were the case, ''far side'' would be correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the news conference last week, Maria T. Zuber, the principal investigator, said the probes would be crashing into a ''non-sunlit'' part of the surface. I translated that into a more common word: dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, it was a nice allusion to Pink Floyd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because there is a permanent near side and a permanent far side, many interpreted ''dark side'' as ''permanently dark side.'' As the readers pointed out, as the Moon rotates, the Sun rises over the entire surface during the course of a monthlong lunar day. That's true. The crash sites, which are actually on the near side of the Moon, are not always dark, but what is relevant is that the crash sites were dark at 5:28 p.m on Monday. The crashes were not visible because the area was dark, not because they were out of the line of sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a couple of weeks, it will come back into sunlight, and it's at that point that NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will attempt to photograph the gouges left by the two Grail spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is easy to see if you sketch out three circles, for the Sun, Earth and Moon. Then it's instantly clear that the dark side -- the side facing away from the Sun --­ is different from the far side, ­ the side facing away from the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or just remember: Pink Floyd has nothing to do with Gary Larson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, astronomers should come up with a term to describe the side of the Moon facing away from the sun. (Make your suggestions in the comments.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A smaller number of readers wondered why the spacecraft will crash when the maneuvering fuel runs out. The Moon has no atmosphere and therefore there is no friction to slow them down. But the Moon's gravity is uneven and the orbit is not perfectly circular. Without periodic course adjustments, it will become more chaotic and elliptical, and the ellipse will intersect with the surface of the Moon -- i.e., crash.</p>

</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM J. BROAD and CHOE SANG-HUN; William J. Broad reported from New York, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea.   </div><div>857 words</div><div>18 December 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Korean satellite launched into space last week appears to be tumbling in orbit and is most likely dead, astronomers are reporting. The evident failure will not cause the spacecraft to fall quickly back to earth but seems to represent a major blow to the North's portrayal of the launching as a complete triumph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's spinning or tumbling, and we haven't picked up any transmissions,'' said Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks rocket launchings and space activity. ''Those two things are most consistent with the satellite being entirely inactive at this point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea's state-run news media said nothing about the satellite's dysfunction, focusing instead on the event the launching was supposed to honor: the somber first anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-il, the longtime leader. As part of the coverage, state television broadcast video of his daughter-in-law -- her first public appearance in more than a month -- that appeared to confirm that a new member of North Korea's notoriously reclusive Kim dynasty is on its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images showed Ri Sol-ju, the wife of Kim Jong-il's son and successor, Kim Jong-un, dressed in a dark flowing dress and walking slowly beside her husband inside the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum in Pyongyang, the capital, where Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il-sung, lie in state. Although she was wearing a high-waisted, loose-fit, traditional ''hanbok'' dress, and there was no official mention of pregnancy, South Korean media detected what they considered a visibly swollen belly. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted a government source as saying that birth was ''imminent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State media has been describing the satellite launching as a triumphal achievement of the young leader, completed despite worldwide criticism and United Nations sanctions on the North's ballistic missile program. On the day of the launching, the mission director, Kim Hye-jin, told reporters that the satellite was broadcasting in orbit ''Song of Gen. Kim Il-sung'' and ''Song of Gen. Kim Jong-il.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, about the size of a washing machine, reportedly carries an on-board camera to observe the earth. That mission requires the spacecraft to remain quite steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McDowell said tumbling would imply that on-board systems meant to control and stabilize the craft had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that radio astronomers had picked up no signals from the satellite and that optical astronomers had observed it brightening and dimming as it slowly rotated through space end over end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clear that the rocket part of this mission worked very well for the North Koreans,'' Dr. McDowell said in an interview. ''They ended up in the right orbit. But the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the satellite failed either during the ascent or shortly afterwards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea fired the small satellite into orbit last Wednesday atop a long-range rocket, a first for the impoverished nation. The official Korean Central News Agency hailed it as demonstrating ''indomitable spirit and massive national capabilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, rumors circulated in Washington that the satellite was malfunctioning. Astronomers who turned a variety of telescopes on the sky have now gathered evidence that supports that finding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Roberts, a retired professional astronomer who lives in Cape Town, South Africa, reported Sunday on an Internet site that he was able to observe the satellite flashing through repeated cycles that would brighten and dim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, he added, ''appears to be doing a regular tumble.'' On Monday, he added that new observations showed the satellite reaching its maximum brightness roughly once every 16 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail, Mr. Roberts cautioned that he still needed to make more observations to confirm the evident tumbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glaring absence of any signals or other signs of life from the spacecraft suggests it is dormant or dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radio silence stands in contrast to North Korea's early wave of excited proclamations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Christy, a British radio astronomer who has tracked satellites for decades and runs an observers' Internet site, said in an e-mail from England that for days after the launching he listened for the satellite but could hear nothing and found no plausible signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I still wouldn't rule out it turning up,'' Mr. Christy said. But he noted that North Korean officials have already missed an opportunity to make ''any real propaganda out of it transmitting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted Molczan, a sky watcher in Toronto who is also tracking the satellite, said tumbling would have little if any impact on the orbit's decay and the satellite's re-entry through the atmosphere, where the blistering heat of friction will eventually cause it to burn up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be up there for at least a few years,'' Mr. Molczan said. ''The real question is whether the satellite is functioning. Right now, it looks like it's rotating aimlessly.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tigers and pandas live in Asia, kangaroos and koalas in Australia and polar bears and snowy owls in the Arctic. The world can be divided into regions based upon the unique types of animals that live there. Or so the thinking went when Alfred Russel Wallace published the scientific world's first global biodiversity map in 1876.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a century has come and gone since Wallace released this groundbreaking work, yet his map largely still serves as a cornerstone for understanding modern distributions of biodiversity. An updated version was due, a group of researchers decided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wallace's map still makes a lot of sense," said Jean-Philippe Lessard [http://www.jeanphilippelessard.com/Jean-Philippe_Lessard/Home.html], an ecologist at McGill University in Montreal who was formerly at the University of Copenhagen. "We're not inventing anything here, we're just implementing Wallace's vision at an age where we have tons of DNA and more information on where species are on the planet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Craig Leisher noted here [mailto:http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/a-real-life-indiana-jones/] last month, Wallace is something of a folk hero among biologists. He simultaneously thought up the theory of evolution by natural selection alongside Charles Darwin yet also made time for clambering around collecting specimens in the most exotic spots in the world. His wanderings and studies eventually led to that first map of animal distributions across the continents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wallace recognized that the world is divided into so-called biogeographic regions, which today we know reflect the breakup of the continental plates roughly 200 million years ago. As the former mega-continent of Pangaea split apart, the evolutionary branches of those species cleaved off from one another. Millenniums of isolation following this divergence led to Australia's wildly unique marsupials, for example, and Madagascar's beloved lemurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wallace recognized these differences and produced a map identifying six major global biodiversity regions. Other maps have been produced since, but for this new effort, the researchers decided to take into account not only the current distribution of vertebrates, but also how they relate genetically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Genetic sequencing allowed us to do things that weren't possible before," Dr. Lessard said. "Looking at these evolutionary links allows us to know which parts of the world are more closely related to other parts of the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a team of 14 international colleagues, Dr. Lessard helped compile and analyze the phylogenetic relationships of 21,037 species of amphibians, birds and mammals. Whereas Wallace highlighted six major animal realms, the team identified 11, and within those realms made 20 regional distinctions. The results were published online today [http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2872/content/early/2012/12/19/science.1228282] by the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few surprises turned up in their analyses. For example, new realms in Central America, East Asia and Oceana emerged. The northernmost stretches of the Canadian tundra make more sense grouped with the Palearctic realm, which encompasses Siberia, Europe and North Asia, than with North America's Nearctic realm. "Apparently, plant people kind of informally recognized that grouping in the past," Dr. Lessard said. "But for animals, I've never seen a map of biogeographic regions showing that connection."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dividing lines will soon be uploaded and freely accessible on Google Earth [http://macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace], and the researchers hope to add information detailing which big animal families are found in each realm and region for curious citizens or researchers to explore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new map is by no means definitive, however. As more animal groups are added - reptiles, for example, or freshwater fishes - the lines between regions and realms may shift. Although the required distribution and genetic data needed to incorporate those additions are still lacking, Dr. Lessard and his colleagues used scalable methodology to build their map, so adding more animal classes should be fairly straightforward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maps may also shift as the planet warms as a result of climate change. Having this baseline may help scientists understand how species distributions change in the coming decades. "The earth will surely change, but we don't know how it will change," Dr. Lessard said. "We know what biodiversity on the planet looks like now, but 50 years from now we could come back and redo the whole thing so we can quantify those changes in the future."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELLEVUE, Wash. -- The job description and title, ''Chief Asteroid Miner,'' are not what you are likely to come across on a job-search Web site. Besides, the position is taken. Chris Lewicki, the president of Planetary Resources, a company based in this city just east of Seattle, has it on his business cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly an audacious thing that we're after,'' said Mr. Lewicki, 38.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of small start-up companies have stars in their eyes, captivated by entrepreneurial dreams -- some half-baked, some brilliant, often a bit of both -- of global success and riches. Here, at least the part about the stars is literal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an otherwise unremarkable low-rise office park, with the Bread of Life Christian Church and a gym as neighbors, Mr. Lewicki and about 30 employees are aiming beyond Earth for the next great gold rush. (They are actually after the platinum group of metals, which dwarf gold in value and rarity.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are planning, within a decade or so, an unmanned robotic mining mission to the asteroid belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is not new. Space exploration enthusiasts have talked about harvesting the ancient, mineral-laden chunks of rock that hurtle through interplanetary space since at least the 1920s. A decade ago, in the frothy go-go era before the recession, an asteroid mining company was started and sold shares to the public before crashing to earth and going out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is new is the money and backing from people with global reputations who have said they think Planetary Resources has the right stuff. The company, quietly founded in 2010 and rarely seeking any attention until recently, has the filmmaker James Cameron as an adviser. Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt, top executives at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, are among the investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, as millions of moviegoers know, resource extraction efforts ended in tears for the miners in Mr. Cameron's space epic ''Avatar.'' Those miners sought something called unobtanium, whatever that was, on a faraway moon. Mr. Cameron did not respond to e-mailed questions or repeated requests for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But company leaders at Planetary Resources said in an interview that their business model would be based on the journey itself. Creating a company that could one day launch ships into the unknown darkness of space, and, rather like the shipping magnates of sailing and whaling days past, wait years for a booty-laden return means selling space technology along the way -- much of which will have to be invented -- to help finance the dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is developing its own orbital telescope, for example, geared to survey remote asteroids to figure out what they are made of, with a planned launching within two years. But it also plans to produce the devices commercially, with a price in the single-digit millions, for corporations, governments or individuals. The idea, company officials said, is to finance finding and mining asteroids by selling, in a sense, the shovels and picks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The engineering in many cases has been solved,'' said Mr. Lewicki, who spent 10 years at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory before joining Planetary Resources. ''What will settle the winners from the laggards will be who can find the best economic model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economics of space, said Eric Anderson, a founder of the company, also look increasingly different as the costs and complications of resource extraction here on Earth have soared. Getting deep-sea oil off the coast of Brazil, for example, is expected to cost billions before the first barrel is pumped, he said, which makes the ''single-digit billions,'' which Mr. Anderson estimates his company will ultimately need to launch a prospecting ship and return within the next decade, a much less daunting number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are on the scale of the kind of resource dollars that get spent on Earth to bring something on line,'' he said. ''The private equity markets are used to that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here are very excited about water, too. Recently published discoveries that water is more prevalent in the nearby universe than previously believed have become part of the plan here, because water can be distilled to hydrogen, allowing -- at least in theory -- an asteroid ship to travel light, making its own fuel on site for the return trip. Water has been found even on Mercury, locked in ice on the poles of the hottest planet in the solar system, nearest the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a really interesting mixture of the highly technical and highly primitive,'' said Mark V. Sykes, the chief executive and director of the Planetary Science Institute, a 40-year-old private nonprofit research organization based in Tucson. Dr. Sykes described how a spacecraft might dock on an asteroid with sophisticated technology and then use simple concentrated sunlight to make fuel for the long slow voyage home, perhaps by solar sail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while some scientists like Dr. Sykes, who has advised Planetary Resources on asteroid science, said they thought the company could indeed one day go where no mining company has gone before, skeptics said they thought the timeline for making a trip out and back, with something to sell at the end, could be far longer and more expensive than company officials thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They look like rocks, like you could reach out and break off a piece, but they are almost certainly rubble piles,'' said Erik Asphaug, a professor of planetary science at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span> who studies asteroids. With unstable, unconsolidated interiors and no gravity to speak of in most nearby asteroids, many of which are about the size of a city block, a ship would not be able to land at all in a traditional sense, but instead would have to dock as though with a space station and then lock itself onto the asteroid to keep from bouncing back into space. The details are devilish and could take decades, in his opinion, if not a century, to solve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the question of saving us from the Big One.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively little money is being spent now on developing tools that could avert or destroy a large asteroid discovered to be on a collision course with Earth, Professor Asphaug said. But if one day a threat were to emerge, he added, the company or companies that know most about asteroids could suddenly be quite popular with the world's governments -- not for riches, but rescue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 22, a fast-moving fireball flew through the sky over Nevada and California and exploded. Some people witnessed the event, others snapped photos, and a security camera near Lake Tahoe caught it on video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, using pictures, videos and rock fragments, 70 scientists from around the world have pieced together the back story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From analyses of dozens of fragments that fell to Earth, they report that the fireball was a small asteroid — about 10 feet in diameter — belonging to a rare and primitive class of bodies called carbonaceous chondrites, from the inner region of the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid was going unusually fast when it entered the atmosphere — about 18 miles per second, according to the scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s twice as a fast as many other meteor falls,” said Peter Jenniskens[http://www.seti.org/users/peter-jenniskens], an astronomer at the SETI Institute[http://www.seti.org/] in Mountain View, Calif., and an author of the report, which appears in the journal Science[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2872/content/338/6114/1521.summary?sid=affa3217-0a12-4813-9b02-d44cab88d751]. “It’s the fastest meteor impact we’ve been able to record.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doppler weather radar picked up falling meteorites, giving clues to where to look for fragments, Dr. Jenniskens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the fragments were found by volunteers. Dr. Jenniskens and a colleague held town meetings to teach people how to identify and handle meteorites.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROUND ABOUT THE EARTH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circumnavigation From Magellan to Orbit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Joyce E. Chaplin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 535 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joyce E. Chaplin faces a challenge in ''Round About the Earth.'' She's written a 535-page history of circumnavigation, from the voyages of Ferdinand Magellan (1519-22) to the Dutch teenager Laura Dekker (2011-12), which is to say the history of a highly conceptual and antiquated exploit. We all sense that encircling the planet is -- or was -- quite a feat. But a feat of what, exactly? Today it's possible to book a round-the-world air ticket simply by tapping a smartphone. After Magellan's expedition did it the first time, one wonders if there's any sense in recording all those who came after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chaplin would argue that there is. And she does so with a storyteller's brevity and dry wit in this captivating account of world-rounding expeditions. Chaplin is a Harvard historian and the author of ''The First Scientific American: Benjamin Franklin and the Pursuit of Genius.'' She sees circumnavigation as an endeavor that began as conquest and evolved into an act of planetary love. World-circlers have given humanity a ''whole-body ­experience of the whole Earth,'' she writes, ''what it felt like, from agonizing to exhilarating.'' They brought us news of the world entire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's funny that Magellan stands as the supreme circumnavigator, given that he actually didn't circumnavigate. And that he was, as Chaplin points out, ''more or less a ruthless thug.'' His expedition began as a ploy to reach the Spice Islands -- now part of Indonesia's Malaku Islands -- via a radically backward route: sailing west, not east. The journey promised to make Magellan and his crew either very rich or very dead. The Spice Islands contained the world's only source of cloves, mace and nutmeg, and in the early 1500s sailors who survived the journey could sell them in Europe at an enormous profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magellan departed Spain with a flotilla of five ships carrying about 280 men and a huge store of supplies. To say he was neither well-liked nor trusted would be an understatement verging on fraud. Before he even reached the tip of South America, the masters of three ships conspired, unsuccessfully, to kill him. A fourth ditched the party and sailed home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's a lesson to be learned from Magellan's life, it's that bold doesn't pair well with stupid. While stopping in the Philippines, Magellan responded to a chieftain's insult with a rash show of force. He died in the ensuing battle, run through with bamboo spears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leadership fell to a Basque navigator named Juan Sebastián de Elcano. Though he received little credit -- no GPS units named for him, thank you very much -- Elcano was the one who actually completed the trip. Three years after departing, the expedition limped home with one ship, 18 survivors and a cargo of cloves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Death was a near certainty for the men who signed up for those early world-rounders. That didn't stop European regents from sending them, though. ''The most unfortunate legacy of the first circuit of the world,'' Chaplin writes, ''was a vision of world domination.'' From its very beginning, circumnavigation was an imperial act carried out by nations wanting or maintaining global empires. Chaplin observes that early circumnavigators ''had no respect for the territories of non-Europeans,'' and thought of foreign lands as resupply points or potential colonies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that vein, few circumnavigators surpassed the rudeness of the Englishman Francis Drake, who set out half a century after Elcano's return. Drake ­realized he could travel light and pick up provisions along the way. And by pick up I mean steal. ''The most precious resource, geographic knowledge, came in human form,'' Chaplin writes, ''and Drake stole that too.'' That is, Drake kidnapped pilots of plundered ships and put their coastline knowledge to work for him in the ­wheelhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one thing Drake couldn't steal was health. Those early voyages were death-ridden because of scurvy, the killing vitamin C deficiency brought about by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest challenge of circumnavigation over the centuries, in fact, hasn't been conveying the body around the globe as much as keeping it alive during the trip. The British navigator James Cook is often considered the Jonas Salk of scurvy, but it was actually an earlier English circumnavigator, John Byron, who pioneered the inclusion of fresh provisions into the shipboard diet. Cook came along a few years later and institutionalized Byron's innovations. By insisting upon a clean ship, dry clothes, ventilation and veggies and fruit, Cook safeguarded the lives of all but 6 of the 232 men on his 1772-75 circumnavigation. ''As one member of Cook's second voyage marveled,'' Chaplin writes, ''the mortality rate within the expedition was in fact statistically lower than could be found among men on land.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As ships improved, global travel became more an everyday fact than a daring feat. Wealthy tourists began taking the trip on their own dime. By the late 19th century circumnavigation had fallen into the tattered realm of the publicity stunt, carried out by odd characters backed by circulation-hungry newspapers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airplanes just made things worse. ''There would always be suspicion that flying around the world was cheating, that surface travel was more challenging,'' Chaplin notes. I'll bet you can't even name one of the four <span class="companylink">United States Army</span> Air Service pilots who first circumnavigated the Earth by air. Anybody? (Fredrick L. Martin, Lowell H. Smith, Leigh Wade, and Erik ''The Flying Viking'' Nelson. In 1924. It took them 175 days.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until the dawn of space travel that circumnavigation regained its luster. Here again, half the challenge was keeping the body alive during the trip. Special capsules and spacesuits had to be invented to protect astronauts from the killing vacuum of outer space. The low-gravity atrophy of muscle and bone became a kind of minor scurvy of space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the voyages of Elcano and Drake led monarchs to dream of world conquest, the 1961 orbit of the Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin showed that humanity had made at least a little progress. Instead of hatching plans to colonize the moon, world leaders came together some months after Gagarin's triumph to agree to a United Nations resolution declaring outer space and all celestial bodies to be ''free for exploration and use by all States.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the planet can be orbited in 90 minutes, speed records have been rendered meaningless. What matters in globe-trotting today isn't attainment but the manner in which the feat is done -- what mountaineers call ''good style.'' The most popular circumnavigators are actors. The ex-Python Michael Palin went 'round with curiosity and good humor in his BBC series ''Around the World in 80 Days.'' Palin's 1989 show was followed in 2004 by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's classic motorcycle journey, ''Long Way Round.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circumnavigation marks humanity's progress upon the Earth -- not just technological advancement, but the maturing of our relationship with the land, the sea and one another. Once we encircled it to own it; now we do so to comprehend it. Round-the-world travelers, Chaplin writes, ''generated copious evidence of humanity's longing for the Earth.'' Perhaps none expressed it more succinctly than Yuri Gagarin, who recalled looking down upon the entire planet for the very first time. ''It is,'' he said, ''indescribably beautiful.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest and most sophisticated rover landed safely on Mars and the world's most famous Moon visitor died, but the space event that most captured the public's imagination in 2012 involved a journey to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 14, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> counted 52 million streams of the Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner's supersonic, record-breaking jump from a balloon 24 miles above the New Mexico desert. <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> called it ''one of the most-viewed live events ever,'' and it landed at No. 10 on the video-sharing site's year-end trending list -- the first time a science-related subject made the list, a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> spokeswoman said. (<span class="companylink">Google</span> listed the leap as No. 7 in its Zeitgeist 2012 of trending events.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it was far from the only science story to go viral. To put it in 140 characters or less, social media and science found each other in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felix Baumgartner's supersonic freefall from 128k' - Mission Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In surprising numbers, people posted, viewed and searched for science-related topics last year -- sharing news from space and undersea, commenting on new discoveries and uploading photos and video in a full-out embrace of the ability to communicate with thousands of others about global subjects in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> message on Aug. 5 from @MarsCuriosity, NASA's official rover handle -- ''Gale Crater I Am in You!!!'' -- was retweeted more than 72,000 times.

And the director James Cameron's claim to have sent the ''deepest tweet'' -- from the Mariana Trench, about seven miles below the surface of the Pacific -- was rated one of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s ''moments of serendipity and just plain awesomeness'' (though it was actually sent by a friend above water). Four science-related events made that list, with the Mars landing at No. 1.In an age of despair over math and science acuity, it appears that what was once considered uninteresting or unfathomable has become cool and exciting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People now feel that ''if they're not paying attention, they're missing out on something,'' said Kevin Allocca, the trends manager for <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover in particular has picked up followers and likes at amazing speed and volume, though it is the fourth landing of an American space exploration vehicle on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went from 120,000 on Aug. 4 to over 800,000 followers on landing night,'' Veronica McGregor, the media relations and social media manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said of its <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account. ''And then we hit a million really quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months after the landing, the mission was averaging about 30,000 <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> mentions a month. The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page for NASA's Mars rover Curiosity is heading toward a half-million likes, and the hashtag #Curiosity was the fifth most used on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Plus in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is, in some ways, self-fulfilling. Social media platforms are growing in popularity. There is also more online content, which is becoming more accessible, entertaining and engaging, Mr. Allocca said. Science subjects are also universal, more likely to attract global audiences.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Communications Satellites Made Legal for Export</span>
</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM J. BROAD </div><div>776 words</div><div>4 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the delight of American satellite makers, communications satellites -- which orbit Earth to relay phone calls, link ships to shore and broadcast television programs -- will become legal for civilian export under legislation that President Obama signed into law on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the United States founded the industry, manufacturers were forced to pull back from international markets after a 1999 law categorized the satellites as weapons and restricted their export. At the time, Congress was fearful that selling satellites abroad could allow technology secrets to fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defense bill that President Obama signed will undo that step and let American companies sell communications satellites as civilian technology rather than as deadly arms. Among the beneficiaries will be companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, Hughes and <span class="companylink">Space Systems/Loral</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a tremendous assist for an industry that is inherently international,'' said Patricia A. Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, a business group in Washington. ''It will ensure our place at the forefront of space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a practical matter, communications satellites made their debut in 1964 and quickly became stars of the space age. The first craft, orbiting at 22,300 miles, relayed signals to the United States from Japan that let American television viewers watch live coverage of the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry stumbled 13 years ago after Republicans in Congress pressed for a law that restricted communications satellite exports. The lawmakers praised it as a security precaution that would prevent China and other perceived foes from stealing technology secrets. Detractors saw it as a cynical ploy meant to discredit the Clinton administration and its policy of Chinese engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That law put communications satellites on Washington's list of export-controlled munitions: tools of war like tanks, bombs, missiles and equipment for making nuclear arms. Foreign companies took the opportunity to increase their satellite sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law gives Mr. Obama the authority to return communications satellites to their previous status as civilian technology. It retains provisions that restrict the export of satellites to nations like China and North Korea, and to sponsors of state terrorism like Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who introduced a bill to change the policy on satellite exports and whose state is a space industry hub, said the measure offered satellite manufacturers a crucial lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Companies across the country have been operating at a disadvantage due to these policies,'' he said in a statement. ''These reforms will give our businesses a chance to compete globally while still protecting our national security interests.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strict export controls arose from a political fight over satellite launchings by China, which in the 1980s began offering cheap rides into orbit on low-cost rockets. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, both Republicans, approved transfers of American spacecraft to Chinese rockets, as did President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in early 1998, a series of upsets brought the expanding trade to a halt. Two American satellite makers involved in the Chinese launchings, Hughes and Loral, were accused of giving China advice about making not only commercial rockets, but also military missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans, who controlled Congress at the time, argued that satellite exports could lead to a hemorrhage of secret materials and information, and said that China might already have stolen encryption secrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the strict export rules took effect in 1999, the legal complications involved in selling communications satellites and components abroad contributed to a sharp decline in the American share of the market, from a dominating position to about 50 percent today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama said the rules had ''unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry'' and vowed to push for change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, who for a decade helped lead the movement for change, said its culmination as law would help restore the nation's competitiveness in the global satellite market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Treating commercial satellites and components as if they were lethal weapons, regardless of whether they're going to friend or foe, has gravely harmed U.S. space manufacturers,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berman added that the benefits extended beyond the manufacturers. The national security establishment relies on the companies and their technological skills to fulfill the government's satellite needs and to develop spacecraft involved in a wide range of military missions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRANDS often give away trips like a weekend in New York, but now Axe, the men's grooming brand, has a giveaway that it can say, without hyperbole, is out of this world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To promote a new line of products called Apollo, the <span class="companylink">Unilever</span> brand will send 22 consumers into space. The former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, hired as a spokesman, announced the contest at a private media event at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brand refers to the effort as the Axe Apollo Space Academy, or AASA, meant to rhyme with NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Axe is contracting with the Space Expedition Corporation, which plans to begin conducting commercial flights on Lynx, a suborbital space plane, in 2014. The Lynx, which is being developed by <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>, will take off and land horizontally, like an airplane, and use rocket power to blast into space. It seats only the pilot and one passenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Space Expedition Corporation, which reports having already sold more than 200 tickets for future spaceflights, usually charges $100,000 for each flight that Axe is giving away. Flights are planned to last about an hour, reach an altitude of 64 miles, and provide a weightlessness experience of about five to six minutes before the Lynx descends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flights will be from Curaçao, an island off the Venezuelan coast. In a promotion for the sitcom ''The Big Bang Theory'' last July, CBS awarded a single ticket for a spaceflight on a Lynx space plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept for the Axe promotion, and a campaign including television commercials, is by the London office of <span class="companylink">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</span>. In a commercial, a buff firefighter rescues a beautiful woman from a burning building. After they reach safety, they stand near the burning building, and the woman stares longingly into his eyes. Then, in the distance, she sees an astronaut in a spacesuit walking toward her, and she ditches the firefighter to run toward the astronaut. The text on the screen: ''Nothing beats an astronaut. Ever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A voice-over directs viewers to AxeApollo.com to enter the contest. ''Axe Apollo Space Academy,'' continues the voice-over. ''Leave a man. Come back a hero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial was introduced online on Wednesday, and will begin appearing widely on television on Feb. 4, in rotation with another Apollo commercial that will be introduced during the Super Bowl on Feb. 3. This will be Axe's first time advertising during the Super Bowl, where 30-second spots this year are estimated to cost an average of $3.7 million to $3.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Axe spaceflight promotion, rather than marketers coming up with a prize suitable for a specific product, it was the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Kolbusz, a creative director at <span class="companylink">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</span>, said that about a year ago his agency was considering ideas to promote the entire Axe brand, not just one fragrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was just a notion that Axe as a brand has always been about giving men confidence, and we also settled on this idea of women loving a hero and the universality of an astronaut as a hero,'' Mr. Kolbusz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that space tourism is beginning to capture attention, with companies including Virgin Galactic (started by Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span>), the agency began exploring the possibility of giving away rides on flights to Axe users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Axe also was developing an unnamed fragrance. To align it with a nascent space promotion, the company decided to name the fragrance Apollo, after the American program dedicated to landing astronauts on the moon in the 1960s and '70s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was just a lovely symbiosis between the two things,'' said Mr. Kolbusz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew McCarthy, senior director of brand development for Axe in North America, said that marketing for Axe consistently takes ''truths about guys and girls and attraction and finds interesting and relevant ways to bring those to life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partnering with Mr. Aldrin and sending Axe users to space will resonate as ''a timeless theme about heroes and men,'' Mr. Kolbusz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brand reports that the campaign will be the most expensive for Axe, which was introduced in France 1983 and in the United States in 2002, but declined to provide specific figures. Axe spent $53.7 million on advertising in the United States in 2011, down from $92.7 million in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Axe Apollo, which began appearing in stores this month, is being introduced as a scented line across a variety of grooming products, including body spray, deodorant, shower gel and shampoo. Most have a suggested retail price of $4.30, and shampoo retails for $5.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To enter the contest, which will be promoted in 60 countries in about 45 languages, contestants will complete what the brand is calling an astronaut profile detailing why they should be chosen. Based on popular votes, the brand will send 100 to 105 finalists from throughout the world to a space camp in Orlando, Fla., for three days of training and testing. The brand and expedition company will choose 21 winners from that group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 22nd ticket will be awarded directly to a United States resident in a sweepstakes from Jan. 9 through Feb. 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an online-only video, Mr. Aldrin discusses his own space mission 44 years ago and promotes the Axe flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now you can become part of this privileged group and experience everything that I have,'' Mr. Aldrin says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the parent of teenage boys who have to be dragged out of bed on school days, I had been looking forward to earlier sunrises once the winter solstice was past. But early January mornings seemed darker than ever while at the same time, the sky was clearly lighter around 5 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out that what I suspected was actually true -- by Jan. 2, there were 12 more minutes of sunlight in the afternoons, but 3 fewer minutes in the morning. It also turned out that the reasons for it were complicated, as I discovered in a series of phone and e-mail conversations with Jay M. Pasachoff, a professor of astronomy at Williams College, and a former student of his, Joseph Gangestad, who received his Ph.D. in orbital mechanics from Purdue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They pointed me to the Equation of Time, a grandly named formula relating to the fact that not all days are 24 hours, if you track noon by the position of the Sun instead of on a clock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've all seen a readout of the Equation of Time, Dr. Pasachoff said. It's that uneven figure 8 that can be found on globes in a deserted part of the Pacific, a shape known as an analemma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Earth's axis were perpendicular to its orbit instead of tilted, and if its orbit were a circle instead of an ellipse, the Sun would appear in the same spot in the sky each day and clocks and sundials would always match. Instead, they can be as much as 16 minutes apart, and that's where things get complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Earth moves toward winter solstice, you have ''different things going on at the same time,'' Dr. Pasachoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth's tilt means that every day during the fall, the angle at which we view the Sun changes. It appears farther south and travels a shorter arc across the sky, affecting sunrise and sunset equally, and making the day shorter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in the solar time follow a different cycle. In the early 1600s, Kepler discovered that planets move faster at the part of their orbit that is closest to the sun, the perihelion. For Earth, perihelion comes a little after the winter solstice, so from November on, Earth is accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increased speed means we reach the Sun's maximum a little earlier each day, which pushes solar noon backward against clock time. That shift is amplified because the Sun is traveling a little south each day, while clocks only count its east to west traverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add it all together and you get sunrise and sunset times that are not symmetrical. In the weeks before the winter solstice, sunrise is being pushed later by both the changing angle of the Sun and the slowing of solar time. But sunset is being pushed in both directions -- earlier by the Sun's angle and later by the change in solar time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is more darkness in the morning and less in the afternoon. That's why the earliest sunset of 2012, at 4:29 p.m., in New York fell as soon as Nov. 30, according to the <span class="companylink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>'s solar calculator, while mornings continued to stay dark later. After the solstice, Earth continued its acceleration until reaching perihelion on Jan. 2. So the sunrise continued to slide, reaching its latest point, 7:20 a.m., on Dec. 28. There it stood until Jan. 11, when we finally got another minute of morning light. By Feb. 7, sunrise will be all the way back to 7 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to wrap the mind around this problem, which is really a figment of our timekeeping system,'' Dr. Gangestad said. That is, we would never notice it if we all just used sundials.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>980 words</div><div>17 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- An inflatable space pod to be attached to the International Space Station in a couple of years will be like no other piece of the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of metal, its walls will be made of floppy cloth, making it easier to launch (and then inflate).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said Wednesday that it had signed a $17.8 million contract with <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> to build the module, which could reach the space station as soon as 2015. That is a bargain-basement price compared with most equipment the United States and other countries send into space, and the Bigelow agreement could serve as a model for how NASA puts together missions at lower costs by using a Kmart strategy: buying off-the-shelf pieces instead of developing its own designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This program starts a relationship that we think, and we hope, is going to be meaningful between NASA and ourselves,'' Robert T. Bigelow, the chief executive of Bigelow Aerospace, said at a news conference here at the company's headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-Earth orbit, he said, is the ''first target,'' but larger modules could be used for stations in deep space or for habitats on the Moon. ''We have ambitions to get to the Moon someday, to have a base there,'' Mr. Bigelow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fold-up, blow-up approach solves the conundrum of how to build something voluminous that can be packed into the narrow payload confines of a rocket. The soft sides of the module, called the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam, will allow it to be scrunched like a T-shirt in a suitcase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the space station, it will be attached to an air lock and then inflated like a balloon and expanded by a factor of 10 to its full size -- about 13 feet long and 10 feet in diameter, with about 560 cubic feet of space inside. At least initially, it will remain empty as NASA gathers data about its characteristics, including temperature and protection against micrometeorites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balloonlike structure is carefully designed not to pop. The fabric walls will consist of several layers including Vectran, a bullet-resistant material. Even if punctured by a high-speed meteorite, the fabric does not tear. A hole in a metal structure in space, by comparison, can cause explosive decompression as air rushes out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Beam module reaches the space station, astronauts might go to it to seek solitude: engineers expect it will be the quietest spot there. The fabric walls absorb sound vibrations instead of transmitting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beam revives a concept that NASA developed more than a decade ago for an inflatable four-story crew quarters on the space station. Congress halted the work as the station's construction costs grew sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow, who made a fortune in construction and hotels, licensed the technology from NASA and set up his factory here in North Las Vegas, investing more than $250 million of his own money. The company has already launched two unmanned prototypes into orbit, showing that they can remain inflated for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Beam is successful, NASA will probably incorporate the technology into any manned mission to an asteroid or elsewhere in the solar system, or to build a base on the Moon or Mars. Inflatables could also overturn notions of what a spacecraft ought to look like: Instead of the sleek, shiny machines imagined in science fiction, the practical ones of the future may be blobby, soft-sided contraptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow holds space ambitions of his own. His company is building two much larger inflatable modules, each with 11,600 cubic feet of space, to launch as the world's first private space station, docked together as station Alpha. The plan is to lease space on Alpha to countries that want to set up low-cost space programs and companies that want to conduct zero-gravity research. Tourists might be invited, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, Mr. Bigelow announced prices for travelers to his space station: $26.25 million for a 60-day stay, including the ride to orbit atop a Falcon 9 rocket built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. If the traveler wished to book the rocket ride in a more expensive capsule under development by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, the cost would be about $10 million more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow said the pieces of his private space station would be ready for business as soon as other companies were able to provide the rocket transportation for the people going up and down. The Beam module is a variation of earlier designs, allowing Bigelow to set a fixed price for NASA. With most of its development programs, NASA pays the contractor for time and effort -- and overruns. With the fixed-price contract, if Bigelow runs into obstacles, the company, not NASA, will absorb the additional costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For pennies on the dollar, NASA will be able to test a technology that could have implications for future exploration,'' said Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator. ''It represents a new way of doing business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Bigelow succeeds not only at building inflatable structures, but also at juggling the logistics of operating and supplying a space station, its private stations could soon overshadow the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Bigelow station, which could be in orbit by late 2016, would be large enough to house a dozen people, twice as many as the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company intends to build additional ones to meet demand, and it has already begun designing an enormous module with 74,000 cubic feet of space.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JUSTIN GILLIS   </div><div>1393 words</div><div>22 January 2013</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my article[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/science/earth/seeking-clues-about-sea-level-from-fossil-beaches.html?hp] in Tuesday's Science Times about the risks of long-term sea level rise, and in an accompanying podcast[http://podcasts.nytimes.com/podcasts/2013/01/22/science/22-science-podcast/20130122-sciencetimes-podcast.mp3], I reported on the link between past instances of global warming, caused by natural fluctuations in the climate, and higher shorelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on a study of these past variations, some scientists believe that even if we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, we would be due for a substantial rise in sea levels over the long term as ice sheets slowly respond to the warmer temperatures brought on by the greenhouse gases that humans have already dumped into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paleoclimate record, as it is known, suggests that even a slight amount of global warming can produce a rise of 25 to 30 feet. And if scientists are anywhere close to right in their projections, the warming over the coming century due to human activity is going to be more than slight. That means a long-term rise in sea level of as much as 80 feet cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I noted in the article, that would take quite a long time to occur, at least hundreds and more likely, thousands of years. On the time scale that people tend to worry about, the next century, the rise would be much less. A common estimate is three feet, although there are persistent fears[http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2012/20121226_GreenlandIceSheetUpdate.pdf] that the situation could turn out to be worse than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I did not point out is that, now matter how fast it happens, the increase of sea level will not be an even rise everywhere on the planet. Rising sea level, it turns out, is "lumpy" - the sea goes up more in some places than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may seem strange, since we tend to think of the ocean as a giant bathtub filled with water. If you turn on the faucet and add water to a tub, of course, it rises evenly. Why doesn't the ocean work that way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say sea level rise in a given location is actually influenced by a multitude of factors. To take one of the most obvious, land can be sinking even as the ocean is rising. This is happening today across much of the East Coast of the United States, with especially high rates of sinking in the Chesapeake Bay[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/24/AR2010102402996.html] region and in southern Louisiana[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060601-new-orleans.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The converse can also be true, of course - land in some places is rising fast enough to outpace the rise of the sea. That is happening today in parts of Alaska[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/science/earth/18juneau.html] and Scandinavia[http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/sweden-the-land-of-the-rising-coastline-8373787.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If land is sinking, that worsens the local effects of a global increase in sea level. And it turns out that sinking land[http://www.deltas2010.com/SinkingDeltas-NatureGeo9-20-09.pdf] is going to be one of our biggest problems, worldwide, as climate change proceeds. That is because many of the world's great cities are, like New Orleans, built on river deltas - which is to say, on mud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humans have interrupted the flow of sediment to those deltas in most places, and the land surface is sinking as the older sediment underlying the cities compacts and settles. Withdrawal of groundwater or petroleum can worsen the situation, although water withdrawals have been limited in many places specifically to slow the sinking[http://www.hgsubsidence.org/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we get a global increase of sea level of several feet by the end of this century, as many scientists expect, the effects are going to be felt most strongly in the big cities with brisk rates of land subsidence. Aside from New Orleans, examples include Tokyo, Houston, Shanghai, Bangkok and Venice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complexities do not stop there. As water is added to the ocean basins, the basins themselves adjust to the extra weight, behaving less like a bathtub and more like a kid's pool made of flexible plastic. The ocean floor can actually sink. The deformation is slow, but it changes the distribution of ocean water over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that can alter sea levels is a shift in wind patterns. The prevailing winds can cause water to pile up in some locations, as happens today off the eastern coast of Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these factors complicate any forecast about sea level rise, and most or all of them can be important for a given locale. But to me, the strangest and most interesting variable has to do with gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are immense, and it turns out they exert enough gravitational pull to draw a substantial amount of ocean water toward them. So if you imagine the whole Greenland ice sheet melting, for instance, something quite bizarre will happen nearby: sea level will fall across an area stretching more than a thousand miles from the ice sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If Greenland should catastrophically melt tomorrow, sea level will fall in Scotland, it will fall in Newfoundland - and it will fall in Greenland, by a lot," said Jerry X. Mitrovica[http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k58621&amp;pageid=icb.page300510], a Harvard scientist who helped to pioneer the study of such effects. Something similar would happen in the vicinity of Antarctica if the West Antarctic ice sheet, believed to be highly vulnerable to a modest global warming, were to melt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about the implications of this finding: If sea level is going to fall near the melting ice sheets, that means it has to rise more than the average in other places, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is bad news for some countries. It means an average global rise in sea level of 30 feet, say, could translate to a 40- or 50-foot rise in some parts of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists think the exact distribution of sea level rise will depend on which of the two ice sheets melts - or, more likely, what proportion of each melts. If you live on the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, for example, a given amount of melting in faraway Antarctica will produce a substantially larger increase of sea level than the same amount of melting from nearby Greenland. It's counterintuitive, but true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of all this, as the ice sheets melt, the redistribution of mass around the planet will be large enough, according to Dr. Mitrovica and several of his colleagues, that it will actually alter the rotation of the earth. That, in turn, will cause another modest redistribution of ocean water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many moving arrows, the effort to predict exactly what will happen with sea level rise is a work in progress. But we already know that both Greenland and West Antarctica are starting to melt and dump extra ice into the ocean in response to climate change. Globally, sea level is now rising at a rate of about a foot a century and the rate appears to be accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the immense growth of human settlements near the ocean over the last century, the risks of this situation are pretty clear. Scientists fear a perpetual humanitarian crisis will begin before the 21st century is out, as people are forced to flee the rising sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At my request, the researcher Benjamin H. Strauss at the organization Climate Central[http://www.climatecentral.org/], made a rough calculation of the number of people living within 10 meters, or 33 feet, of sea level: 710 million, or about 12 percent of the world's population. And about 1.3 billion people, or 21 percent of the population, live within 82 feet of sea level. In other words, the kinds of long-term increases in sea level that scientists are talking about could wind up displacing a substantial fraction of the human population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the advice from scientists to reduce the level of risk by limiting greenhouse emissions has basically fallen on deaf ears, and global temperatures are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my article, I quoted Dr. Mitrovica as pointing out that the temperatures expected later this century have, when they occurred in the past, caused the catastrophic collapse of the ice sheets in both Greenland and West Antarctica. In an interview, he added, "I don't think you should have any confidence that we're going to somehow escape that if we continue with these temperatures."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHETHER in Davos or almost anywhere else that leaders are discussing the world's problems, they are missing by far the biggest issue: the rapidly deteriorating global environment and its ability to support civilization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is pretty much an endgame. Unless pressing issues of the biology of the planet and of climate change generated by greenhouse gas emissions are addressed with immediacy and at appropriate scale, the matters that occupy Davos discussions will be seen in retrospect as largely irrelevant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, in Bonn, out of sight and out of mind, international negotiators will design the biodiversity and ecosystem equivalent to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A full eight years have passed since President Jacques Chirac of France acted as host at a meeting in Paris to create this ''Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress has been painfully slow. Only now is the ''platform'' and its work program -- to assess status, trends and possible solutions -- being designed. In the meantime, rates of extinction and endangerment of species have soared. Ecosystem destruction is massive and accelerating. Institutional responsiveness seems lethargic to a reptilian degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is abundantly clear that the target of a 2-degree Celsius limit to climate change was mostly derived from what seemed convenient and doable without any reference to what it really means environmentally. Two degrees is actually too much for ecosystems. Tropical coral reefs are extremely vulnerable to even brief periods of warming. The elevated atmospheric CO2 also has raised the acidity of the oceans, which affects the ability of coral and mollusks such as oysters to build shells and skeletons. A 2-degree world will be one without coral reefs (on which millions of human beings depend for their well-being).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current global warming of 0.8-0.9 degrees, the fingerprints of climate change can be seen virtually everywhere in nature. The coniferous forests of western North America are currently experiencing massive tree mortality because climate change has tipped the balance in favor of native bark beetles. The Amazon seems to be edging close to dieback in the southern and southeastern portions of the great forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At essentially double that current temperature increase, there undoubtedly will be massive extinctions and widespread ecosystem collapse. The difficulty of trying to buffer and manage change will increase exponentially with only small increments of warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the last time the planet was 2 degrees warmer, the oceans were four to six (perhaps eight) meters higher. We may not know how fast that will happen (although it is already occurring more rapidly than initially estimated), but the end point in sea-level rise is not in question. A major portion of humanity lives in coastal areas and small island states that will go under water. The site of the Earth Summit and Rio+20 will disappear under water fairly early on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a 2-degree increase should be unimaginable. Yet to stop at 2 degrees, global emissions have to peak in 2016. The Carbon Tracker organization has examined fossil-fuel investments around the world (including 1,200 new coal plants) and determined that they would lead to a 6-degree world. A recent <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> report indicates the bank cannot fulfill its development mission in a 4-degree world. Given what we know about planetary biology, 2 degrees seems nightmarish as it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what to do? The first thing is to recognize both the climate and biodiversity agenda as deadly important, of utmost urgency and fundamental to the future of humanity. The second is to find ways to keep temperature increase below 1.5 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those is to use the biology of our planet to pull about half a degree of warming potential out of the atmosphere before that potential is realized. Lag times between attaining an atmospheric CO2 concentration and the consequent heat accumulation make this possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, because all living things are built of carbon, restoring ecosystems (e.g., reforestation and restoration of grasslands) can recapture carbon lost to the atmosphere through past deforestation and ecosystem degradation. Ecosystem restoration has multiple benefits, including better grazing and enhanced soil fertility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simultaneously, we need to identify ways to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere nonbiologically. There already are ways to burn carbon-based fuels and capture the CO2 before it leaves chimneys. Better yet would be to find ways to pull CO2 from the atmosphere that are economic, even with the lower atmospheric concentrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Geoengineering'' schemes to reduce planetary temperature rather than atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be avoided. They only address the symptom (temperature) to the neglect of the cause (elevated greenhouse gas levels). As a consequence they are mostly irrelevant, dangerous and do nothing to reduce ocean acidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental change is happening rapidly and exponentially. We are out of time. Only three generations back -- in the same decade as the original scientific publication of the greenhouse effect -- my great-grandfather chaired the commission that designed the New York subway system. How was he to anticipate the sea-level rise that contributed in part to the impact of Hurricane Sandy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How will things look just two or three generations ahead? Can we avoid the greatest intergenerational environmental injustice of all time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June the intergovernmental process of Rio+20 proved to be monumentally disappointing. Happily, the <span class="companylink">Convention on Biological Diversity</span> is invigorated by new leadership and, among other things, has called for a ''concerted effort on ecosystem restoration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, inadequate funding nips at its heels. While there is some welcome private sector interest, what is needed is a world in which governments face the environmental challenge squarely, and truly lead. The current mode of nibbling around the edges is pretty much pointless.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. When I read that ''the universe is 13.7 billion years old,'' I wonder: Don't scientists use some more universal measurement than years, something not tied to the orbit of one tiny planet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Modern measurement of time builds on the second, based on atomic oscillation, rather than on the variable time it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the <span class="companylink">National Institute of Standards and Technology</span> explains, a second has been defined since 1967 as the time it takes for a cesium atom to oscillate 9,192,631,770 times between two radiation states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alternative unit called the cosmic year has been suggested, based on the Sun's orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy about once every 225 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this ''year'' is not routinely used by cosmologists, said Andrew J. S. Hamilton, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The age of the universe is not something that is directly measured by astronomers,'' Dr. Hamilton said. ''What they measure is the rate of expansion of the universe, as measured by the so-called Hubble parameter'' -- named for the 20th-century astronomer Edwin Hubble, who was one of the earliest to calculate the expansion rate by noticing that the more distant galaxies are receding at faster speeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A value called the reciprocal of the Hubble parameter is approximately equal to the age of the universe, or 13.7 billion years, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not exactly equal,'' he added, ''because the universe has been decelerating and accelerating under the influence of gravity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over 9,000 feet up Mount Lemmon in the Coronado National Forest sits the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>'s SkyCenter[http://skycenter.arizona.edu/], which houses the largest telescope in the southwest open for public observing. The university boasts an elite academic astronomy program, and the telescope is a Tucson treasure; scholars travel from around the world to spend an evening studying the far-off galaxies visible from the observatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university recently teamed up with another of Tucson's big draws: the Miraval Resort &amp; Spa[http://www.miravalresorts.com/], known for its experiential programming. Beginning in February, Miraval will offer its own, more grounded version of "space tourism," with excursions to the SkyCenter for stargazing, and to the university campus where visitors will be able to see some of the world's largest telescope mirrors being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The educational adventure begins at the resort with a lecture by an astronomer from the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>. Next up is a tour of the mirror labs, located underneath the school's football field (the only area on campus large enough to accommodate their construction). If a visit to an underground site that gives the impression of - as the astronomy layman and Miraval president Michael Tompkins calls it - "a top-secret C.I.A. laboratory" isn't enough, Day 2 includes an evening at the SkyCenter guided by Adam Block, an astro-photographer and winner of the 2012 Hubble Award. Block says this offers visitors the chance "to see, really with their own eyes, what the universe looks like; the kind of things most only read about in books or see on TV." He also coaches guests on how to take photos of faraway galaxies, the Milky Way and solar systems. These are far from snapshots: one photo can take hours to create, depending on the distance of what is being photographed and the exposure time required to capture it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sleeping quarters at the center are rustic - they were designed for scientists at work, after all - but there is always the option to return to Miraval for overnight accommodations. And a visit to one of the country's leading resorts would not be complete without some soothing rejuvenation: the "Tranquil Nights Outdoor Spa Treatment" included in the $599 program might not be quite as strictly educational, but it offers its own escapist pleasures.</p>

</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM J. BROAD; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.   </div><div>916 words</div><div>29 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian state television said Monday that the nation had put a monkey into space ''as a prelude to sending humans.'' The successful flight involved a relatively small rocket that went straight up and down, according to the state-sponsored news report, and the monkey survived the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western experts said the brief experiment appeared to have few if any immediate military implications, as it might have if Iran had launched a much larger vehicle that could fly high and fast enough to put a major payload into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't demonstrate any militarily significant technology,'' said Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks rocket launchings and space activity. ''This is a tiny old rocket, and what's on top is useful only for doing astronaut stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, he and other experts said, the exercise seemed to represent a small but significant step in Iran's stated goal of developing rockets big and advanced enough to send human astronauts into space -- a goal Tehran has repeated publicly for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at a private research group, GlobalSecurity.org, in Alexandria, Va., said that the flight, if truly successful, showed that Iran was slowly mastering the technology of life support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's significant in that it shows progress toward manned spaceflight,'' he said in an interview. But Mr. Vick urged caution about the Iranian claims, noting that news media reports suggested that Iran in 2011 had tried and failed to put a monkey into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think they messed up,'' he said of the reported failure, conceding that other Western experts disagreed on whether Iran had in fact tried to launch a monkey earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James E. Oberg, a former NASA engineer and author of a dozen books on human spaceflight, said Iran's civil space advances also had propaganda value, since the peaceful flights could take global attention off the nation's military feats and ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To a large degree, it's a fig leaf,'' he said in an interview. ''Like the North Koreans, they get to present their program as peaceful when lots of it has to do with weapons development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, space powers have lofted ants, spiders, mice, rats, frogs, snails, fish, turtles, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, monkeys and chimpanzees as cover stories for military programs and as high-flying experiments meant to pave the way for sending humans into orbit. Iran in recent years has said it has launched a mouse, a turtle and a number of worms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a question of testing life-support reliability for people,'' Mr. Oberg said. ''Things in zero gravity don't always behave like they do in test chambers on earth. It's prudent to look for things you might have overlooked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the military side, Iran has tested and fielded a growing arsenal of powerful missiles that now threaten Israel and limited parts of Europe. In 2009 and 2011, it successfully put satellites into orbit. Aerospace experts say the orbital steps can help Iran develop long-range missiles that one day might target the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran is also pursuing a program to enrich uranium, which can fuel reactors or nuclear warheads atop missiles. For many years, Western powers have failed to persuade Iran to abandon the sprawling effort, which they see as aimed at making nuclear arms. Iran has denied that charge and insists its goals are entirely peaceful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Iran's Press TV, a state-run broadcaster, said the monkey had been launched in a space capsule code named Pishgam, or Pioneer. It quoted the director of the Iran Space Agency, Hamid Fazeli, as saying this month that ''because of biological similarities between humans and monkeys, the latter were selected for the space mission.'' He also predicted that Iran would send a human into space within the ''next five to eight years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western space experts could give no confirmation of the report, which Press TV called evidence of ''yet another'' Iranian achievement in launching animals into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state news agency, IRNA, said the monkey rode on a Kavoshgar rocket that reached an altitude of 75 miles and ''returned its shipment intact,'' Reuters reported. The monkey survived, Press TV said. The timing of the reported launching was unclear -- either on Monday or within the past few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report emerged as Western officials in Brussels said they had offered Iran new dates in February to resume the long-running and inconclusive nuclear talks, Reuters reported. Iranian officials reportedly turned down a request for a meeting in Istanbul at the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vick of GlobalSecurity.org said Iran's program for human spaceflight was apparently making progress not only in launching animals into space but in developing large new rockets and launching facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, he said, Iran unveiled information about a space capsule meant to hold human astronauts. ''It's based on Chinese technology,'' Mr. Vick said, adding that Iran had nearly completed a large new launching pad big enough for powerful rockets that could loft warheads, satellites or people into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's nearly done,'' Mr. Vick said of the launching facility. ''It's for the big new launcher they're building.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea succeeded in thrusting a satellite into orbit for the first time on Wednesday, joining an elite club of space technology leaders seven weeks after the successful launching of a satellite by its rival, North Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea has attached an intense national pride to the 140-ton, 108-foot-tall Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or KSLV-1, which was built with the help of Russian technology. Feeling behind China and Japan, both of which have successful space programs, South Korea has sought a technological prowess of its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That task gained more urgency after North Korea launched a long-range rocket on Dec. 12 that put a satellite into orbit, after earlier failures. Only a handful of countries have succeeded in independently launching satellites into orbit, with Iran also recently joining the club. After studying the debris of the North Korean rocket, which splashed into South Korean waters, officials here determined that North Korea, despite its backward economy, had built key parts of its rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all major South Korean television stations broadcasting live, the two-stage rocket blasted off from the newly built Naro Space Center in Goheung, 200 miles south of Seoul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After analyzing the data, we determined that our satellite entered its intended orbit,'' Lee Ju-ho, the minister of education, science and technology, said during a nationally televised news conference. ''Today, we took a leap toward becoming a power in space technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although part of the two-stage rocket was built by the Russians, South Korea sees the successful launching as having given it an important toehold in space technology, the latest high-tech market where the country has decided to become a player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful launching comes at a delicate time on the Korean Peninsula, as North Korea, stung by new international sanctions over its own rocket launching, has promised a nuclear test. The United Nations has banned North Korea, which has an active nuclear arms program, from ballistic missile tests; the West considers the launching a test of that technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea previously fired a KSLV-1 rocket twice from Goheung, first in 2009 and again in 2010, but each time, the rocket failed to put a satellite into orbit. This was the third effort, initially scheduled for October, but it had been twice delayed at the last minute because of technical glitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, South Korea's space ambitions have languished under the constraints of agreements with the United States, which feared that a robust rocket program might be transferred to the building of missiles and help accelerate a regional arms race.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1913 Premier Earl of Scotland Dies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- The Earl of Crawford, premier earl of Scotland and head of the House of Lindsay, died yesterday [Jan. 31] at his London residence, 2 Cavendish square, in his sixty-sixth year. Lord Crawford was a distinguished representative of a very ancient family. He was a recognized authority on astronomy and also a noted Orientalist. Lord Crawford devoted himself to astronomy immediately on leaving Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1872 he induced his father to erect the Observatory of Dunecht, in Aberdeenshire, one of the finest private observatories in the United Kingdom.</p>

Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine's dramatic order -- ''Arrest all thieves, racketeers and other criminals!'' -- was called everything from ''terroristic'' to ''ridiculous'' by the police court magistrates.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week provides another reminder of the reality of that threat, not that Earth's history doesn't already provide plenty of warnings. Bill Marsh, an illustrator at The Times, created the illuminating chart above (the image is a detail; click for the full graphic[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/10/sunday-review/asteroid-graphic.html]) to show just how close the asteroid known as 2012 DA14 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_DA14] will come on Friday. It will pass not only far inside the orbit of the Moon, but even closer than the 22,300-mile distance where geosynchronous satellites orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was fortunate to participate in a 2010 workshop assessing what kinds of protocols should be developed to coordinate international responses when astronomers finally identify an object that will hit Earth. A report from that meeting, "Responding to the Threat of Potentially-Hazardous Near Earth Objects," provides a primer on both the risk and possible responses. Here's the introduction:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record of history, as written in the many impact craters on Earth and the moon, demonstrate that it is just a matter of time before astronomers discover a near Earth object (NEO) headed toward a collision with Earth. As the 1908 Tunguska event, which leveled trees across an area of Siberia some 30 km in diameter demonstrated, even relatively small objects (30-50 m diameter) are capable of inflicting enormous damage. When such an event is imminent, how should we respond? Who should respond?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON Feb. 15, an asteroid designated 2012 DA14 will pass safely within about 17,200 miles of Earth's surface -- closer than the communication satellites that will be broadcasting the news of its arrival. The asteroid is about 150 feet in diameter and has a mass estimated at about 143,000 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should an object of that size hit Earth, it would cause a blast with the energy equivalent of about 2.4 million tons -- or 2.4 megatons -- of TNT explosives, more than 180 times the power of the atomic blast that leveled Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's almost as if nature is firing a shot across our bow to direct our attention to the vast number of nearby rocky asteroids and a few icy comets that make up what we call the near-Earth object population. We should take the warning seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no known asteroids or comets represent a worrisome impact threat now, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory shows more than two dozen asteroids have better than a one in a million chance of smacking into Earth within the next 100 years. That may sound reassuring, but we estimate that less than 10 percent of all near-Earth objects have been discovered. And while we are keeping a vigilant eye out for these objects in the Northern Hemisphere, we are considerably less watchful in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been only within the last 15 years that astronomers, mostly supported by NASA, have begun discovering the vast number of near-Earth objects. Our findings have led us to the realization that Earth runs its course around the sun in a cosmic shooting gallery -- with us as the target. Basketball-size rocky objects enter Earth's atmosphere daily and <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>-size objects every few months, but they burn up before they hit the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Objects larger than about 100 feet in diameter, the size of a large house, strike Earth with an average interval of a few hundred years. The last one of about this size to hit was on June 30, 1908, in a sparsely populated region of Siberia called Tunguska. The Tunguska blast released about four megatons of energy and leveled millions of trees across 825 square miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A much larger asteroid or comet, six miles in diameter, collided with Earth some 65 million years ago, killing most of the large vertebrates, including the dinosaurs. Fortunately, Earth collisions with objects so big happen only at average intervals of 100 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can be done if a rogue asteroid is judged to be on a trajectory that threatens Earth? Our best option would be to send a spacecraft to collide with the asteroid and modify its trajectory to ensure that the Earth is missed by a wide margin. We have the technology to do this -- and, in fact, did it in 2005, when we intentionally slammed a spacecraft into the comet Tempel-1. As the science fiction author Larry Niven once said, the dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2010, President Obama called upon NASA to send a human mission to an asteroid by 2025 as a steppingstone for the much more difficult human exploration of Mars. The technologies and life support systems needed for the Mars expedition could be tested first at a nearby asteroid with the round trip taking only a few months instead of a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUITE apart from their menacing reputations or as steppingstones to Mars, near-Earth objects are important in their own right. They are the leftover bits and pieces from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago, so they provide insights into the original chemical mix and environment of our nascent solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may also have played a key role in how life arose on Earth. Asteroids and comets most likely brought to the earth much of the water and carbon-based materials that allowed life to form more than 3.5 billion years ago. Subsequent impacts then punctuated evolution, allowing only the most adaptable species to evolve further. Remember the dinosaurs? We mammals may owe our very existence and our position atop the food chain to near-Earth objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are compelling reasons to use these objects as sources of raw materials for the future construction of space habitats and supply depots. They are rich in minerals, metals and platinum-group elements, and their clays and ices could provide water resources. (Within the last year, two United States companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, announced plans to mine asteroids for their resources.) The water could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, the most efficient form of rocket fuel. Near-Earth objects may serve as the watering holes and fueling stations for interplanetary exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll also need to continue to aggressively discover and track them, if we are to be assured of having a future as a species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three NASA-supported observatories with modest telescopes in the southwestern United States and in Hawaii are making more than 95 percent of near-Earth object discoveries. Because of budget limitations, an observatory at Siding Spring, Australia, the only one looking for these objects in the Southern Hemisphere, has reduced its operations to only occasional observations, leaving a blind spot for unknown objects approaching from the southern skies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ground-based observatories will always be important as we follow these intriguing objects. But a space-based, wide field-of-view telescope operating in the more sensitive infrared light wavebands is the best way to find the majority of hazardous asteroids within the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA and its domestic and international partners need to be allowed to redouble the search for near-Earth objects with more powerful search telescopes, both ground-based and space-based, so we are not caught off guard. We need to find them before they find us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To highlight science education and memorable haircuts, one of the guests in Michelle Obama's box during the State of the Union speech Tuesday night will be the "Mohawk Guy" - Bobak Ferdowsi, a member of the team operating NASA's Mars Curiosity rover who is best known for his spiky, red- and blue-streaked haircut and the stars shaved on the side of his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday, Mr. Ferdowsi was driving when he got a phone call from John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser. "He said the first lady would like to invite you to the State of the Union address," Mr. Ferdowsi said. "It's kind of a surprise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tuesday night's speech, Mr. Obama is likely to touch on familiar themes touting the importance of science education and innovation for the United States economy. In its descriptions of the invited guests, the White House noted that Mr. Ferdowsi volunteers as a mentor at robotics competitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it is the hair that gained the 33-year-old Mr. Ferdowsi his renown, not to mention marriage proposals and more than 50,000 followers on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a history of getting special haircuts to commemorate milestones on the Mars project. "The team knew I was going to do something special for landing night," he said. "And rather than let me decide on my own, my boss sent out an e-mail poll to the team, letting them vote on my hair."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision: "They wanted a red, white and blue kind of theme."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Obama phoned the NASA team in August to congratulate its members on the successful landing of the rover, he singled out Mr. Ferdowsi, joking, "I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself, but my team keeps on discouraging me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferdowsi has had the Mohawk since then, although he has modified the accouterments a couple of times. For the rover's first drive, he replaced the stars with dots and dashes that spelled out J.P.L., for Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Morse code. (The wheels of the rover have the same pattern, endlessly spelling out those letters as it rolls along Mars.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he has a new pattern. "For tonight, I have U.S.A. on one side and Mars on the other," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Updated, 5:40 p.m. As our colleagues Ellen Barry and Andrew Kramer report[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/world/europe/meteorite-fragments-are-said-to-rain-down-on-siberia.html], Russians recorded video[http://youtu.be/iCawTYPtehk] of a bright flash, apparently debris from a meteor, "streaking through the sky in western Siberia early on Friday, accompanied by a boom that damaged buildings across a vast area of territory." Hundreds of injuries were reported, mainly from breaking glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video clips, many recorded from cars[http://youtu.be/90Omh7_I8vI] on the dashboard cameras that are popular in Russia[http://kottke.org/12/12/russians-are-dashboard-cam-crazy], quickly spread from social networks to Russian news sites[http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/15/02/2013/845289.shtml?autoplay]. While it was not possible to confirm the authenticity of all of the clips posted online, several tracked closely with witness accounts and each other. (Russian speakers should be aware that some of the videos contain strong language.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-061], "The Russian fireball is the largest reported since 1908, when a fireball hit Tunguska, Siberia[http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/30jun_tunguska/]."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fireball entered the atmosphere at about 40,000 mph (18 kilometers per second). The impact time was 7:20:26 p.m. PST, or 10:20:26 p.m. EST on Feb. 14 (3:20:26 UTC on Feb. 15), and the energy released by the impact was in the hundreds of kilotons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the duration of the event, it was a very shallow entry. It was larger than the fireball over Indonesia on Oct. 8, 2009. Measurements are still coming in, and a more precise measure of the energy may be available later. The size of the object before hitting the atmosphere was about 49 feet (15 meters) and had a mass of about 7,000 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the day, NASA released more information about the meteor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our colleague Henry Fountain reminds us of the vastly greater impact of what's known as The Tunguska Event[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/science/meteor-not-siberias-first-brush-with-falling-space.html] on 1908.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several clips showed a flaming object streaking through the sky and a burst of blinding light followed by a smoke trail. One, shot by a driver named Alexander Mezentsev, showed a bright light over a city street in Chelyabinsk, a city of 1 million about 900 miles east of Moscow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One clip, recorded on a street in Chelyabinsk, appeared to capture the chaotic aftermath of the event[http://youtu.be/b7mLUIDGqmw], as glass shattered after the shock wave and people shouted and tried to make sense of what was happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A very loud explosion could be heard about 25 seconds into another video[http://youtu.be/Np_mpGYSBSA], apparently recorded on a phone in the same city by a blogger named Sergey Hametov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was panic. People had no idea what was happening," Mr. Hametov told The Associated Press[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/meteorite-falls-russian-urals]. "We saw a big burst of light, then went outside to see what it was and we heard a really loud, thundering sound."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blast, and breaking glass, was also captured about 70 seconds into another clip[http://youtu.be/SRSrdOfbnHI?t=1m10s], which showed very clear images of the smoke trail after the meteor passed by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another video, shot from the window of a building, seemed to capture the long trail of smoke after the object passed through the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several clips also showed what bloggers said was the damage caused by the sonic boom[http://youtu.be/Rj1BOP5WOdo].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports[http://www.rferl.org/contentlive/meteorite-russia/24902797.html?nocache=1], a blinding flash of light was captured by traffic cameras[http://youtu.be/NcZNhJVW5xI] on top of buildings in Nizhny Tagil[http://goo.gl/maps/GoWaH], around 220 miles north of Chelyabinsk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost immediately after the spectacular images appeared online, Russian bloggers started making comic alterations[http://newsru.com/pict/big/1540920.html], adding aliens and President Vladimir V. Putin to the pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the numerous videos that quickly emerged of the incident highlighted a distinctly Russian phenomenon: the viral dashboard-cam clip[http://youtu.be/itMdLTd1l4E]. As the blogger Marina Galperina explained last year[http://www.animalnewyork.com/2012/russian-dashcam/], they are commonplace in Russia partly because of the dangerous driving conditions that lead to so many accidents, and with an unreliable police force such cameras can provide valuable evidence after a crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conditions of Russian roads are perilous, with insane gridlock in cities and gigantic ditches, endless swamps and severe wintry emptiness on the back roads and highways. Then there are large, lawless areas you don't just ride into, the police with a penchant for extortion and deeply frustrated drivers who want to smash your face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychopaths are abundant on Russian roads. You best not cut anyone off or undertake some other type of maneuver that might inconvenience the 200-pound, six-foot-five brawling children you see on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> hopping out of their SUVs with their dukes up. They will go ballistic in a snap, drive in front of you, brake suddenly, block you off, jump out and run towards your vehicle. Next thing you start getting punches in your face because your didn't roll up your windows, or getting pulled out of the car and beaten because you didn't lock the doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These fights happen all the time and you can't really press charges. Point to your broken nose or smashed windows all you want. The Russian courts don't like verbal claims. They do, however, like to send people to jail for battery and property destruction if there's definite video proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One popular video posted on YouTube[http://youtu.be/elxuGbkvETQ] last year appeared to show just such a fight being prevented by a man facing down another driver clutching a baseball bat by pointing out that any attack on him would be recorded on his dashboard-cam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last month, video recorded by a Russian driver on a dashboard-cam showed a tank suddenly cutting across a highway[http://youtu.be/WmbMd_KxEM0?t=14s].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor that streaked across the Russian skies came from almost the opposite direction as 2012 DA14, the larger asteroid that missed Earth on Friday. That both showed up on the same day was just cosmic coincidence[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - The suspected meteor shower that blasted Siberia[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/world/europe/meteorite-fragments-are-said-to-rain-down-on-siberia.html] early Friday somewhat stole the thunder of another chunk of space rock that was due to stream past Earth later in the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the closest encounter ever recorded with a large space object, the 150-feet diameter asteroid 2012 DA14[http://www.universetoday.com/99950/watch-live-as-asteroid-2012-da14-whizzes-past-earth/] was on course to come within 17,200 miles of the Earth at 2:24 p.m. E.S.T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cosmological terms, that counts as a near miss, although scientists have issued reassuring statements[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/asteroidflyby.html] that there is no need to panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is believed to be a meteor shower struck Russia's Chelyabinsk region, reportedly injuring more than 400 people, was a reminder that danger can come literally out of the blue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It raised the question whether the world is prepared to avert the threat of a potentially much bigger disaster from a collision with a near-Earth object.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have warned that greater international cooperation is needed if humanity is to avoid the fate of the dinosaurs[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/147978-finally-confirmed-an-asteroid-wiped-out-the-dinosaurs], believed to have been wiped out after an asteroid struck what is now Mexico 66 million years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space-watchers are already keeping a close eye on 1999 RQ36[http://www.space.com/13024-nasa-osiris-rex-observing-asteroid-1999rq36.html], a 1,837-feet giant that has a one in a thousand chance of hitting Earth on its next close encounter in 2182.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of 1,300 space rocks on NASA's list of "potentially hazardous asteroids." The U.S. space agency plans to launch an unmanned mission in 2016 to bring back rock samples from the asteroid and measure the forces acting on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anything over a few hundred yards across that appears to be on a collision course with Earth is very worrisome," according to Edward Beshore, a University of Arizona scientist involved in the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research has focused on how to divert potentially Earth-bound space rocks with a variety of technologies that range from attaching them[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3100/diverting-dangerous-asteroids] to space-borne versions of a ball and chain to blasting them with a nuclear bomb[http://www.space.com/18508-asteroid-protection-nuclear-bombs.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first you have to find them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid 2012 DA14, which was near enough to be visible from Earth on Friday during its 4.9 miles-per-second fly-by, was first spotted only in February 2012 by a Spanish dentist.[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2278375/Asteroid-2012-DA14-damage-1-000-atomic-bombs-whizz-past-today.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to asteroid-hunting scientists at the B612 Foundation[http://b612foundation.org/author/edlu/], who include NASA veterans, Friday's close encounter amounts to a wake-up call from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of the million asteroids as large as or larger than 2012 DA14, we have only tracked less than 10,000," it said in a posting on its Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So the fact that we knew ahead of time that 2012 DA14 is about to buzz by Earth is really only a matter of luck," it wrote. "Ninety nine percent of the time we are oblivious, simply because we have not mapped and tracked 99 percent of Near Earth Asteroids."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, space experts from the Association of Space Explorers called for a coordinated international action plan[http://www.space-explorers.org/committees/NEO/neo.html], under the umbrella of <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span>, to counter the asteroid threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its proposals included mounting an international mission to practice diverting a small, harmless space rock, as well as launching a global scientific debate on how best to deflect an asteroid (and who would pay for it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the script of a science fiction movie, it evokes the prospect of disparate nations coming together to counter a common extraterrestrial threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Friday, the Siberian meteorite strike showed the need for an international initiative[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/15/hundreds-injured-meteorite-russian-city-chelyabinsk] to create a warning system for "objects of an alien origin."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You asked us great meteor questions, readers, ones that went beyond the mere fact of the seriously cool video coming from all over Russia[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/video-captures-flaming-object-believed-to-be-meteorite/]. But we wanted to give you a deeper look at the science behind bombardments from space, so we called in a respected source to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark R. Chapman is a senior scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in San Antonio and a pioneer in the field of asteroid threat assessment. He is co-author of the 1989 book, "Cosmic Catastrophes[http://books.google.com/books/about/Cosmic_catastrophes.html?id=CXzvAAAAMAAJ]," with David Morrison, a senior scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an unusual strike. It will take a while for analysis of the videos, and presumably of the seismic records of the explosion, before we can estimate the size of the projectile. I'm guessing it's a once-in-a-decade kind of event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why unusual?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unusual in the sense that it's rare. It's not the kind of event that happens very often. Also, they're talking about maybe 1,000 people injured and some in the hospital[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/world/europe/meteorite-fragments-are-said-to-rain-down-on-siberia.html?hp]. I'm not aware of a strike that has caused that much injury. That's because it hit in a somewhat populated part of Russia, instead of the ocean or the desert or the middle of Siberia where relatively few people would have got hurt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These things happen continually. This one was probably a few meters in diameter but they're flying by the Earth all the time. And they hit - ones this big - maybe once in a decade. Things that would really devastate a city if they hit would occur maybe once every few centuries. It happens on a scale (of meteors small and large). Anyone living out in the countryside or a rural area, if the skies are clear, can look up at night and see apple-seed-size meteors hitting every few minutes, or at least every few hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the meteor that his Russia 2012 DA14, the same one everyone was talking about, or a different one? #NYTScience</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Sasha Smith (@SashaSmish)[http://www.twitter.com/SashaSmish]15 Feb 13[https://twitter.com/SashaSmish/status/302449957024174081]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conceivably it could be part of a swarm, but it's not associated with DA14 [the big asteroid that is to fly close by the Earth on Friday]. They're on totally different trajectories. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but their orbits are totally different. They both intersect the Earth, more or less, but the asteroid is moving maybe south to north and the Russian meteorite west to east. They'd have to be coming in the same direction to be part of a swarm. It's a remarkable coincidence that what may be the most damaging meteor strike in modern history would happen on the same day as the closest passage of an asteroid as big as DA14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How big is DA14?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's about 100 feet across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should we be scared? What can we do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimated danger from a large impact has dropped in recent decades because of telescopic observations and sky surveys. We should continue to monitor the skies for undiscovered large asteroids and for very much smaller ones that could still be quite dangerous, depending on where they hit. We should continue to look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No space telescope now searches for such threats. Would such a device help?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of project wouldn't find what hit Russia (as the asteroid was too small) but it would find ones that are much more dangerous. And once they were detected, we could warn people. We could say, "It's going to hit such an area at a certain time on a certain day and you should stay away from the windows." You could provide warning of impacts that could be dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could we divert a planetary threat?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's found early enough - quite a few years in advance of its hitting - then NASA and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> and other space agencies have the technology to divert the asteroid so it would miss the Earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Russian speakers will be aware, more and less obscene versions of the question, “What was that?” punctuated[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/meteor-in-the-russian-sky.html] many of the spectacular videos[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/video-captures-flaming-object-believed-to-be-meteorite/] recorded in and around the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk on Friday, as what NASA calls[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-061] “the Russian fireball” screamed across the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To answer that question, The Lede turned to Kenneth Chang[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/c/kenneth_chang/index.html], a colleague on the Science desk, who assured us it was a meteor and put together the following guide to near-earth-object terminology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroid: a rock in orbit generally between Mars and Jupiter; fragments of a planet that never came together. Over the eons, because of collisions and gravitational jostling with neighbors, some asteroids have been ejected from the main belt and some are on trajectories that intersect with Earth’s orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet: a chunk of ice and rock originating from the outer solar system. Some of them occasionally get gravitationally nudged so that they zoom toward the inner solar system, with the possibility of hitting Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteor: the streak of light seen when a space rock — an asteroid or a comet — enters the atmosphere and starts burning up. It’s the scientific synonym for “falling star.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteorite: if a meteor doesn’t entirely burn up, a piece of space rock that lands on Earth is called a meteorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteoroid: a space rock that’s bigger than a dust grain but smaller than an asteroid. The dividing line between asteroid and meteoroid is fuzzy, but generally space rocks bigger than boulders are asteroids. So a breadbox-size rock would be a meteoroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolide: astronomers use the term to describe a bright fireball from an incoming meteor; geologists use it as a catch-all term for a comet or an asteroid that hits the Earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDLife is scariest when it imitates science fiction. The stunning video of the meteor that whistled and boomed across Russian skies on Friday unnerved even those with long experience imagining catastrophic events. Past and present practitioners of fantasy fiction in print and movies reacted to the views with awe -- and some new ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of the time we can forget the universe, frankly,'' said Stephen Baxter, president of the British Science Fiction Association and the author of books like ''Space'' and ''Last and First Contacts.'' ''But today, there was 'a crack in the sky and a hand reaching down,' to quote David Bowie. It reminds us of our true location, so to speak.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some on Friday were moved to recall the Tunguska Event of 1908, in which a vast tract in Siberia was flattened, apparently by an airburst from a low-passing asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a much smaller event, but a Tunguska-sized event would vaporize 900 square miles of land,'' said the journalist and fiction writer Tom Bissell, whose 2003 essay ''A Comet's Tale'' investigated end-of-the-world possibilities. ''Can you imagine that happening above a major metropolitan area? It would either fill the churches or empty the churches.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a decade before Tunguska, H. G. Wells published ''The Star,'' in which people helplessly watch as a star nears Earth, causing vast disruptions to the planet but never directly striking it. We are slightly less helpless now, Mr. Baxter said, as we track asteroids more closely and continue to research ways to divert potential party-crashers. But his optimism is the cautious kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we got overconfident in the 1990s,'' with movies like ''Armageddon'' and ''Deep Impact,'' ''when we thought we could fend off any threat,'' he said. ''H. G. Wells knew we couldn't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''A Comet's Tale,'' Mr. Bissell spoke to an astronomer who had ''stopped reading the sci-fi novels he loved as a teenager when the science he was involved in became more interesting to him than fantasy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for filmmakers, fantasy trumps reality, even when they turn their lens, as they have more recently, to the quotidian side of apocalypse from above. ''Seeking a Friend for the End of the World'' uses a pending asteroid collision to pair up Steve Carell and Keira Knightley on a road trip. In Lars von Trier's ''Melancholia,'' two sisters, played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg, try to sort out their lives before the celestial credits roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For others, meteors suggest more outlandish scenarios. Damon Lindelof, a producer and co-writer of the coming ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' and a co-creator of ''Lost,'' imagined being in a meeting with a studio chief on Friday morning and asked on the spot to come up with an idea for a movie tied to the meteor event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My pitch would start by focusing on the lie,'' he said. ''The scientific community, particularly NASA, insists that the meteor that just exploded over Russia has nothing to do with the asteroid hurtling toward Earth -- lies, all lies. Actually, that Russian explosion was an extraterrestrial mortar shell fired from multiple galaxies away as an attempt to divert the asteroid and save Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paused for a moment for dramatic effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, the twist is that these aliens want to enslave us, and Earth is useless to them if it's destroyed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can do better than that,'' said Dave Howe, president of the Syfy channel, after being told of Mr. Lindelof's idea. ''Imagine if that asteroid has dragon eggs inside it,'' he said. ''Add in some low-budget special effects and it would be a classic Syfy Saturday night movie,'' referring to his network's franchise that pushes the B-movie genre to its limit, mashing up disasters and mutated animals into films like ''Arachnoquake,'' about fire-breathing spiders that come to life after a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But who would save the day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly President Putin,'' Mr. Howe said, meaning the Russian leader Vladimir V. ''Only he would come to the rescue on horseback because the asteroid has knocked all the power out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along similar lines, Micho Rutare, the director and co-writer of the 2010 movie ''Meteor Apocalypse,'' imagined a satire in which an asteroid has an electromagnetic effect that knocks out cellphones. ''Imagine the horror and terror,'' he said. ''People would have to actually have conversations in person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jokes aside, Mr. Bissell said he was glad we had not had an even more dangerous event. ''Asteroids are bad, but comets are the worst,'' he said, ''because all of mass extinction on this planet has probably been tied to massive comet impacts. Asteroids go around in a very predictable orbit. Comets can come from so distant in the galaxy, you only figure out where they're going when they go past you.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the detailed video images viewed around the world on Friday showing the explosive meteor in Russia can be traced to what may seem like an unlikely source: the country's reputation for crazy motorists, stupefying traffic accidents and corrupt police officers. This has led many drivers in Russia to install dashboard cameras, which document every minute on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The streaking flash of the meteor as it burned up over a swath of central and eastern Russia came during part of the morning rush-hour commute in the city of Chelyabinsk and other populated areas. Disbelieving motorists who caught the footage on their dashboard cameras quickly uploaded it on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capturing cosmic events on video, however, is not the primary purpose of dashboard cameras in Russia, where they have become almost standard equipment for vehicles in recent years in order to prove innocence in traffic accidents. They have also spawned a sort-of mini industry in voyeuristic Internet entertainment on their own for chronicling the dangers of driving in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> ''Russian traffic violence'' or ''Russian traffic accidents'' to find a litany of motorist chutzpah, ranging from deadly hit-and-runs to crowbar assaults between angry drivers, sometimes in the middle of busy highways. The problem was highlighted by then-President Dmitri A. Medvedev a few years ago, in remarks before the permanent members of <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> Security Council in which he castigated the ''undisciplined, criminally careless behavior of our drivers'' for what seemed an epidemic of road mayhem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving in Russia can be especially challenging because of poorly maintained roads, vast lawless areas and the unsavory reputation of the traffic police, who have been ranked in Russian opinion polls as among the most corrupt officials in the country. Insurance is costly and judges prefer to see visual proof of a motorist's damage claims. Hence the prevalence of dashboard cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hazards were perhaps most succinctly explained last June by Marina Galperina, a Russian expatriate and an editor-blogger for the ANIMALNewYork Web site, who wrote about the ubiquity of Russian dashboard cameras in a blog post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Russia, everyone should have a camera on their dashboard,'' she wrote. ''It's better than keeping a lead pipe under your seat for protection (but you might still want that lead pipe.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fights and other forms of road rage, she wrote, happen all the time, and victims cannot easily press charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Point to your broken nose or smashed windows all you want,'' she wrote. ''The Russian courts don't like verbal claims. They do, however, like to send people to jail for battery and property destruction if there's definite video proof.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- Gym class came to a halt inside the Chelyabinsk Railway Institute, and students gathered around the window, gazing at the fat white contrail that arced its way across the morning sky. A missile? A comet? A few quiet moments passed. And then, with incredible force, the windows blew in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scenes from Chelyabinsk, rocked by an intense shock wave when a meteor hit the Earth's atmosphere Friday morning, offer a glimpse of an apocalyptic scenario that many have walked through mentally, and Hollywood has popularized, but scientists say has never before injured so many people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students at the institute crammed through a staircase thickly blanketed with glass out to the street, where hundreds stood in awe, looking at the sky. The flash came in blinding white, so bright that the vivid shadows of buildings slid swiftly and sickeningly across the ground. It burst yellow, then orange. And then there was the sound of frightened, confused people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 1,200 people, 200 of them children, were injured, mostly by glass that exploded into schools and workplaces, according to <span class="companylink">Russia's Interior Ministry</span>. Others suffered skull trauma and broken bones. No deaths were reported. A city administrator in Chelyabinsk said that more than a million square feet of glass shattered, leaving many buildings exposed to icy cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as scientists tried to piece together the chain of events that led to Friday's disaster -- on the very day a small asteroid passed close to Earth -- residents of Chelyabinsk were left to grapple with memories that seemed to belong in science fiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I opened the window from surprise -- there was such heat coming in, as if it were summer in the yard, and then I watched as the flash flew by and turned into a dot somewhere over the forest,'' wrote Darya Frenn, a blogger. ''And in several seconds there was an explosion of such force that the window flew in along with its frame, the monitor fell, and everything that was on the desk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''God forbid you should ever have to experience anything like this,'' she wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 9 a.m., the sun had just risen on the Ural Mountains, which form a ridge between European Russia and the vast stretch of Siberia to the east. The area around Chelyabinsk is a constellation of defense industry manufacturing cities, including some devoted to developing and producing nuclear weapons. The factory towns are separated by great expanses of uninhabited forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As residents of Chelyabinsk began their day on Friday, a 10-ton meteor around 10 feet in diameter was hurtling toward the Earth at a speed of about 10 to 12 miles per second, experts from the Russian Academy of Sciences reported in a statement released Friday. Scientists believe the meteor exploded upon hitting the lower atmosphere and disintegrated at an altitude of about 20 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface -- not an especially unusual event, the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This meteor was unusual because its material was so hard -- it may have been made of iron, the statement said -- which allowed some small fragments, or meteorites, perhaps 5 percent of the meteor's mass, to reach the Earth's surface. Nothing similar has been recorded in Russian territory since 2002, the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of the meteor's size varied considerably. Peter G. Brown, a physics professor and director of the Center for Planetary Science and Exploration at the University of Western Ontario, said it was closer to 50 feet in diameter and probably weighed around 7,000 tons. He said the energy released by the explosion was equivalent to 300 kilotons of TNT, making it the largest recorded since the 1908 Tunguska explosion in Siberia, which is believed to have been caused by an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteors typically cause sonic booms when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, and the one that occurred over Chelyabinsk was forceful enough to shatter dishes and televisions in people's homes. Car alarms were triggered for miles around, and the roof of a zinc factory partially collapsed. Video clips, uploaded by the hundreds starting early Friday morning, showed ordinary mornings interrupted by a blinding flash and the sound of shattering glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Polyakova, 25, head of reception at the Park-City Hotel in Chelyabinsk, said it was the light that caught her eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw a flash in the window, turned toward it and saw a burning cloud, which was surrounded by smoke and was going downward -- it reminded me of what you see after an explosion,'' she said. The blast that followed was forceful enough to shatter the heavy automatic glass doors on the hotel's first floor, as well as many windows on the floor above, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valentina Nikolayeva, a teacher in Chelyabinsk, described it as ''an unreal light'' that filled all the classrooms on one side of School No. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a light which never happens in life; it happens probably only in the end of the world,'' she said in a clip posted on a news portal, LifeNews.ru. She said she saw a vapor trail, like one that appears after an airplane, only dozens of times bigger. ''The light was coming from there. Then the light went out, and the trail began to change. The changes were taking place within it, like in the clouds, because of the wind. It began to shrink and then, a minute later, an explosion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A shock wave,'' she said. ''It was not clear what it was, but we were deafened at that moment. The window glass flew.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strange light had drawn many to the windows, the single most dangerous place to be. Tyoma Chebalkin, a student at Southern Urals State University, said that the shock wave traveled from the western side the city, and that anyone standing close to windows -- security guards at their posts, for instance -- was caught in a hail of broken glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke to Vozhd.info, an online news portal, four hours after the explosion, when cellphones, which had been knocked out, were still out of order. He said that traffic was at a standstill in the city center, and that everyone he could see was trying to place calls. He said he saw no signs of panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those strange hours, Ms. Frenn, the blogger, wrote down the thoughts that had raced through her mind -- radiation, a plane crash, the beginning of a war -- and noted that her extremities went numb while she was waiting to hear that the members of her family were unhurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When emergency officials announced that what had occurred was a meteor, what occurred to her was: It could happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am at home, whole and alive,'' she wrote. ''I have gathered together my documents and clothes. And a carrier for the cats. Just in case.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor that exploded over Russia on Friday set off the largest explosion of its kind in more than a century, at least according to Western scientists. And even more unusual for a meteor, it caused numerous injuries, mostly from flying glass, as the shock wave violently jolted the city of Chelyabinsk below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hit on the same day that astronomers were watching another larger rock miss Earth by just 17,200 miles, and experts scrambled to understand the two rare cosmic events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some initially speculated that Earth was passing through a swarm of asteroids, but the Russian meteor came from the other direction. ''There is no relation there,'' said Paul Chodas, a scientist with NASA's Near Earth Object Program. ''It seems like we're in a cosmic shooting gallery here. There were two very rare events happening on the same day. Pure coincidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on preliminary calculations, the solar system interloper that shook Chelyabinsk weighed about 7,000 tons and was about 50 feet in diameter when it entered the atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour at about 9:20 a.m. local time, said Peter G. Brown, a professor of physics at the University of Western Ontario. Dr. Brown based his calculations on low-frequency sound waves that traveled as far as Alaska. A worldwide network of such sensors listens for these vibrations, too low to be heard by humans, to verify the ban on nuclear tests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian experts estimated a much smaller size, of just 10 feet across and 10 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid streaked across the sky for about half a minute, unleashing thunderous sonic booms. (Asteroids are orbiting rocks usually between Mars and Jupiter; they are called meteors when they enter the Earth's atmosphere and begin burning up.) The meteor was likely made of stony materials and not solid metal, so as pressure from the atmosphere increased, it exploded at an altitude of 12 to 15 miles above the surface. It released the equivalent energy of 300,000 tons of TNT, Dr. Brown said, although he said that estimate could be revised higher, perhaps to 500,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima during World War II was the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the largest recorded event since the 1908 Tunguska event,'' Dr. Chodas said. On June 30, 1908, the explosion of a meteor, believed to be an asteroid, flattened millions of trees over 800 square miles in a remote, largely unhabited area of central Siberia about 1,200 miles away from Friday's event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a NASA news conference Friday afternoon, Bill Cooke, who leads the Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the orbital path of the meteor showed that it was an asteroid, not a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its farthest point from the Sun, it was 2.5 times as far away as the Earth, before its elliptical path took it closer, and the Earth got in its way on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large meteors could have splashed unnoticed in an ocean in decades past, but nowadays military satellites on the watch for missile launches would certainly notice an incoming meteor this bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid was impossible to detect, Dr. Cooke said, because it was approaching from the dayside. ''And as you know, telescopes can't see things during the daytime,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark R. Chapman, a senior scientist at the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Studies based in Boulder, Colo., said this was the first time a crashing meteor is known to have injured a large number of people. ''That's basically never happened before,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the emptiness of space, billions of rocks, from dust to those miles across, zip around the inner solar system, and collisions with the Earth's atmosphere are frequent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most are mere grains, burning up high in the atmosphere. Larger ones -- the size of peas -- can be spotted streaking across the night sky as ''shooting stars,'' but those also never reach the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small objects the size of a basketball hit the Earth almost every day, once a day on average, and car-size objects hit every month or two,'' Dr. Chodas said. ''Little stuff hits the Earth all the time. We just don't know about it. It's all burning up in the atmosphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists estimate that these tiny meteoritic bits add up to 80 tons of material falling on Earth from outer space each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant impacts have changed the course of life on Earth, notably 65 million years ago when an object several miles wide slammed off the coast of Mexico and killed off the dinosaurs. Collisions with objects the size of the Russian meteor or 2012DA14, the asteroid that did not hit Earth on Friday, occur perhaps once a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA surveys had cataloged 95 percent of near-Earth asteroids 0.6 miles wide or wider, but fewer of the smaller ones. A year ago, a telescope in Spain discovered 2012 DA14, a 150-foot-wide asteroid just after it made a somewhat close pass to Earth, missing by 1.6 million miles. With an orbital period of 366 days, it made a return visit on Friday, at a much closer distance of 17,200 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is closer than many telecommunications satellites. But despite needless anxiety that it would hit Earth, its passing was uneventful, and it will not come that close again until at least 2080.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If 2012 DA14 had collided with Earth, it would have released the energy of 2.5 million tons of TNT, NASA scientists estimate, or nearly 10 times as much energy as the meteor in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some estimates put the Tunguska event even bigger, perhaps 20 million tons of TNT. The makeup of an asteroid can vastly change the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Tunguska, the asteroid also exploded in the air. But in Arizona, an asteroid of similar energy, but made of nickel and iron, slammed into the ground about 50,000 years ago, leaving a crater 4,000 feet wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, astronomers do find the very small asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also had fortuitous luck in 2008 when they discovered an asteroid, smaller than the Russian one, and were able to track it as it entered the atmosphere over Sudan 20 hours later. But most of the time, near misses of objects that small are missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is detectable, but only if we are looking at the right place at precisely the right time,'' Dr. Chodas said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valentina Nikolayeva, a teacher in Chelyabinsk, described it as “an unreal light” that filled all the classrooms on one side of School No. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a light which never happens in life; it happens probably only in the end of the world,” she said in a clip posted on a news portal, LifeNews.ru[http://LifeNews.ru]. She said she saw a vapor trail, like one that appears after an airplane, only dozens of times bigger. “The light was coming from there. Then the light went out, and the trail began to change. The changes were taking place within it, like in the clouds, because of the wind. It began to shrink and then, a minute later, an explosion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A shock wave,” she said. “It was not clear what it was, but we were deafened at that moment. The window glass flew.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strange light had drawn many to the windows, the single most dangerous place to be. Tyoma Chebalkin, a student at Southern Urals State University, said that the shock wave traveled from the western side the city, and that anyone standing close to windows — security guards at their posts, for instance — was caught in a hail of broken glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke to Vozhd.info[http://Vozhd.info], an online news portal, four hours after the explosion, when cellphones, which had been knocked out, were still out of order. He said that traffic was at a standstill in the city center, and that everyone he could see was trying to place calls. He said he saw no signs of panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those strange hours, Ms. Frenn, the blogger, wrote down the thoughts that had raced through her mind — radiation, a plane crash, the beginning of a war — and noted that her extremities went numb while she was waiting to hear that the members of her family were unhurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When emergency officials announced that what had occurred was a meteor, what occurred to her was: It could happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am at home, whole and alive,” she wrote. “I have gathered together my documents and clothes. And a carrier for the cats. Just in case.”</p>
