<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Working gingerly in a cramped area outside the International Space Station, two spacewalking astronauts successfully switched half the outpost's coolant lines on Wednesday into a permanent cooling system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk was the first of three scheduled over nine days, an unusually short time for ventures outside the station by its crew. The trip outside the station officially ended at 6:09 p.m. Eastern time, lasting 7 hours 55 minutes. The astronauts exceeded a planned time of six and one-half hours as they labored to switch electrical and fluid lines from interim to permanent locations on the station's girderlike supporting truss.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers, Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria and Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, both of the Navy, took extra time moving four fluid lines carrying toxic ammonia coolant to avoid being contaminated with the material, as occurred in a 2001 spacewalk. On that mission, the astronaut Robert L. Curbeam Jr. had to brush flakes of frozen ammonia from his suit and spend extra time outside so sunlight could evaporate the rest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Removing thermal covers over the connections, the astronauts carefully relocated the fluid lines and tested the new attachments for a sure fit before replacing the insulating covers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Williams, a flight engineer, said she saw no evidence of an ammonia leak, but Captain Lopez-Alegria, the station commander, said he noticed a large flake floating away at one point that might have been ammonia or a paint chip. Mission planners do not want astronauts to take ammonia back into the station, where it would evaporate and contaminate the air.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts are to perform a nearly identical spacewalk on Sunday to complete the cooling system switch, and on Feb. 8 they will remove some thermal blankets from part of the truss and set up two external platforms for stowing cargo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fourth, but unrelated, spacewalk is scheduled for Feb. 22, when Captain Lopez-Alegria and Mikhail Tyurin, a flight engineer, will venture outside to free a stuck antenna on a Progress cargo craft docked to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is common for astronauts to have closely timed spacewalks when a space shuttle is visiting the station and the shuttle crew does the outside work. During the last shuttle mission, in December, for example, the Discovery's crew performed four ventures outside to rewire the station and retract a solar panel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But spacewalks for a three-member station crew are rare because of astronauts' additional duties of maintaining the outpost during long stays and having fewer people available to help with the outside work.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb. 4 -- Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams set a record Sunday for most total time spacewalking by a woman as she and a crewmate upgraded the International Space Station's cooling system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Williams, of the Navy, broke the previous female spacewalking record of more than 21 hours when she and Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy completed the second of what could be a precedent-setting three spacewalks in nine days. Her record is 22 hours and 27 minutes, which includes a spacewalk in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the spacewalk, which lasted more than seven hours, small amounts of toxic ammonia leaked from a fluid line. The liquid ammonia, which freezes into flakes when it hits the vacuum of space, did not appear to touch either astronaut. Mission Control told them to continue their task of hooking up ammonia fluid lines from a temporary cooling system to a permanent one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once they were back in the space station's airlock, Mission Control had the astronauts test for contamination. The test was negative.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tiny bit of ammonia also leaked during their first spacewalk on Wednesday. Ammonia can cause respiratory problems for the three-person crew if enough of it gets into the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They look like pinpoints,'' Captain Lopez-Alegria said of the flakes on Sunday. ''They don't look like what we saw the other day, but they are coming out with some velocity.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Lopez-Alegria and Commander Williams hooked up the permanent cooling system, covered an obsolete radiator that was retracted by remote control from the ground and stowed a fluid line that was connected to an ammonia reservoir.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They then moved on to other jobs ahead of schedule: removing a sun shade, photographing a solar array that will be retracted during the space shuttle Atlantis's mission next month and making electrical connections for a new system that will allow power from the station to be shared with a docked shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Lopez-Alegria was supposed to jettison the sun shade, but NASA engineers instead had him fold it and stow it in the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third spacewalk is set for Thursday, the first time three spacewalks will have been conducted in such a short period at the space station without a shuttle docked to it. Captain Lopez-Alegria plans to conduct a fourth spacewalk with Mikhail Tyurin, a Russian flight engineer, on Feb. 22.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Sunday's spacewalk, Captain Lopez-Alegria moved up to third on the list of the most time spacewalking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is expected to surpass Jerry Ross's American record of more than 58 hours in nine spacewalks by the end of the month. Anatoly Solovyov of Russia has more than 77.5 hours in 16 spacewalks.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, space experts have worried that a speeding bit of orbital debris might one day smash a large spacecraft into hundreds of pieces and start a chain reaction, a slow cascade of collisions that would expand for centuries, spreading chaos through the heavens. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade or so, as scientists came to agree that the number of objects in orbit had surpassed a critical mass -- or, in their terms, the critical spatial density, the point at which a chain reaction becomes inevitable -- they grew more anxious. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this year, after a half-century of growth, the federal list of detectable objects (four inches wide or larger) reached 10,000, including dead satellites, spent rocket stages, a camera, a hand tool and junkyards of whirling debris left over from chance explosions and destructive tests. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, experts say, China's test on Jan. 11 of an antisatellite rocket that shattered an old satellite into hundreds of large fragments means the chain reaction will most likely start sooner. If their predictions are right, the cascade could put billions of dollars' worth of advanced satellites at risk and eventually threaten to limit humanity's reach for the stars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal and private experts say that early estimates of 800 pieces of detectable debris from the shattering of the satellite will grow to nearly 1,000 as observations continue by tracking radars and space cameras. At either number, it is the worst such episode in space history. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, next year or next decade, some piece of whirling debris will start the cascade, experts say. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's inevitable,'' said Nicholas L. Johnson, chief scientist for orbital debris at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''A significant piece of debris will run into an old rocket body, and that will create more debris. It's a bad situation.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey E. Forden, an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is analyzing the Chinese satellite debris, said China perhaps failed to realize the magnitude of the test's indirect hazards. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Forden suggested that Chinese engineers might have understood the risks but failed to communicate them. In China, he said, ''the decision process is still so opaque that maybe they didn't know who to talk to. Maybe you have a disconnect between the engineers and the people who think about policy.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, experts note, has 39 satellites of its own -- many of them now facing a heightened risk of destruction. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politically, the situation is delicate. In recent years China has played a growing international role in fighting the proliferation of space junk. In 2002, for instance, it joined with other spacefaring nations to suggest voluntary guidelines for debris control. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Beijing is to play host to the annual meeting of the advocacy group, known as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee. Donald J. Kessler, a former head of the orbital debris program at NASA and a pioneer analyst of the space threat, said Chinese officials at the forum would probably feel ''some embarrassment.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kessler said Western analysts agreed that China's new satellite fragments would speed the chain reaction's onset. ''If the Chinese didn't do the test, it would still happen,'' he said. ''It just wouldn't happen as quickly.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week in Beijing, a foreign ministry spokeswoman failed to respond directly to a debris question. Asked if the satellite's remains would threaten other spacecraft, she asserted that China's policy was to keep space free of weapons. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are ready to strengthen international cooperation in this regard,'' the spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, told reporters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cascade warnings began as early as 1978. Mr. Kessler and his NASA colleague, Burton G. Cour-Palais, wrote in The Journal of Geophysical Research that speeding junk that formed more junk would produce ''an exponential increase in the number of objects with time, creating a belt of debris around the Earth.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the cold war, Moscow and Washington generally ignored the danger and, from 1968 to 1986, conducted more than 20 tests of antisatellite arms that created clouds of jagged scraps. Often, they did so at low altitudes from which the resulting debris soon plunged earthward. Still, the number of objects grew as more nations launched rockets and satellites into orbit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, as the count passed 8,000, the National Academy of Sciences warned in a thick report that some crowded orbits appeared to have already reached the ''critical density'' needed to sustain a chain reaction. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, apprehension rose as the fuel tank of an abandoned American rocket engine exploded, breaking the craft into 713 detectable fragments -- until now, the record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid such developments, space experts identified the first collisions that threatened to start a chain reaction, putting analysts increasingly on edge. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 17, 2005, for instance, a piece of speeding debris from an exploded Chinese rocket collided with a derelict American rocket body that had been shot into space 31 years earlier. Warily, investigators searched though orbital neighborhoods but found to their relief that the crackup had produced only four pieces of detectable debris. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, Mr. Johnson, the chief scientist for NASA's orbital debris program, and his colleague J. -C. Liou, published an article in the journal Science that detailed the growing threat. They said orbits were now so cluttered that the chain reaction was sure to start even if spacefaring nations refrained from launching any more spacecraft. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The environment is unstable,'' they wrote, ''and collisions will become the most dominant debris-generating mechanism.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in this atmosphere of rising tension that China last month fired a rocket into space that shattered an old weather satellite -- its first successful test of an antisatellite weapon. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., calculated that the old satellite had broken into 1,000 fragments four inches wide or larger, and millions of smaller ones. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal sky-watchers who catalogue objects in the Earth orbit work slowly and deliberately. As of yesterday, they publicly listed 647 detectable pieces of the satellite but were said to be tracking hundreds more. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakup was dangerous because the satellite's orbit was relatively high, some 530 miles up. That means the debris will remain in space for tens, thousands or even millions of years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kessler, the former NASA official, now a private consultant in Asheville, N.C., said China might have chosen a relatively high target to avoid directly threatening the International Space Station and its astronaut crew, which orbit at a height of about 220 miles. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe the choice was to endanger the station in the short term or to cause a long-term problem,'' he said. ''Maybe that forced them to raise the orbit.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the paths of the speeding Chinese debris, following the laws of physics and of celestial mechanics, expanded in many directions, including upward and downward. As of last week, outliers from the central cloud stretched from roughly 100 miles to more than 2,000 miles above the Earth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solution to the cascade threat exists but is costly. In his Science paper and in recent interviews, Mr. Johnson of NASA argued that the only sure answer was environmental remediation, including the removal of existing large objects from orbit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robots might install rocket engines to send dead spacecraft careering back into the atmosphere, or ground-based lasers might be used to zap debris. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news, Mr. Johnson said in his paper, is that ''for the near term, no single remediation technique appears to be both technically feasible and economically viable.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing is done, a kind of orbital crisis might ensue that is known as the Kessler Syndrome, after Mr. Kessler. A staple of science fiction, it holds that the space around Earth becomes so riddled with junk that launchings are almost impossible. Vehicles that entered space would quickly be destroyed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Kessler called the worst-case scenario an exaggeration. ''It's been overdone,'' he said of the syndrome. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he warned of an economic barrier to space exploration that could arise. To fight debris, he said, designers will have to give spacecraft more and more shielding, struggling to protect the craft from destruction and making them heavier and more costly in the process. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, he said, perhaps centuries from now, the costs will outweigh the benefits. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gets more and more expensive,'' he said. ''Sooner or later it gets too expensive to do business in space.'' </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most of today's astronauts, Lisa Marie Nowak worked in relative obscurity -- even last July, when she took the spaceflight that she had spent 10 years at NASA hoping for.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is famous now, the smiling image of her in astronaut gear a sharp contrast with her police mugshot, a woman with wild hair wearing an expression of personal devastation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is charged with the attempted murder of a woman she believed to be her rival for the affections of a fellow astronaut. Police officials say she drove 900 miles to Florida from Texas, wearing a diaper so she would not have to stop for rest breaks. In Orlando, they say, she confronted her rival in a parking lot, attacking her with pepper spray.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak was in disguise at the time, wearing a wig, the police said. She had with her a compressed air pistol, a steel mallet, a knife, pepper spray, four feet of rubber tubing, latex gloves and garbage bags.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who know her say they are mystified. ''I was in shock,'' said Dennis Alloy, 43, of Tysons Corner, Va., a friend and high school classmate. ''When I knew her, I couldn't imagine an evil bone in her body.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many inside and outside the space agency are wondering how the problems of Captain Nowak, who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1985 and served in the Navy before joining National Aeronautics and Space Administration, were not detected before this. Many are also wondering whether the ''Right Stuff'' image of astronauts has been tarnished, or if that image somehow confused technical excellence with emotional stability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like any other people, they're human,'' said George Abbey, director of the Johnson Space Center when Commander Nowak was selected for the astronaut corps, who recalled her as ''an outstanding candidate.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, 43, was arrested at 4 a.m. Monday at Orlando International Airport, the police said, after attacking the other woman, Capt. Colleen Shipman of the Air Force.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the police report, by Detective William C. Becton, Captain Nowak said that she had not intended to harm Captain Shipman and that she believed that ''this was the only time she was going to be able to speak'' with her. The compressed air pistol she carried ''was going to be used to entice Ms. Shipman to talk with her,'' according to the report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detective Becton wrote, ''When I asked Mrs. Nowak if she thought the pepper spray was going to help her speak with Ms. Shipman, she replied, 'That was stupid.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the police report, Captain Nowak said she saw Captain Shipman, 30, as a rival for the affection of Cmdr. William A. Oefelein, a fellow astronaut. She told the police that she and Commander Oefelein, whose NASA nickname is Billy-O, had ''more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship.'' Commander Oefelein, 41, is divorced and has two children.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday was a day of confusion and quickly shifting events. Captain Nowak, a married mother of three, was brought before a judge for arraignment at 8:30 a.m. Two of her fellow astronauts -- the chief of NASA's astronaut office, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, and Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy -- were there to offer support.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judge had agreed to release Captain Nowak on $15,000 bond on charges of kidnapping and battery, but the police added a charge of attempted murder, and bail was increased to $25,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Shipman is seeking a protective order against Captain Nowak, according to documents posted on the Web site of The Orlando Sentinel, which broke the story Monday night.In Orlando at the end of the day, Captain Nowak posted bail and later in the evening was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet so her movements could be monitored after her return to Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's is going home,'' said her lawyer , Donald Lykkebak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak and her husband, Richard, a flight controller for the International Space Station, live with their children in a two-story brick-and-glass home in Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few neighbors there wanted to talk about the case, but one, who asked that his name not be used, said the couple had an argument in November with raised voices and the sound of breaking china.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one was home on Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement from the family last night on the Sentinel Web site said that the Nowaks had been married for 19 years but that Captain Nowak and her husband ''had separated a few weeks ago.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, Michael Coats, the director of the Johnson Space Center, said in a statement: ''We are deeply saddened by this tragic event. The charges against Lisa Nowak are serious ones that must be decided by the judicial system.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Coats said Captain Nowak was ''officially on 30-day leave and has been removed from flight status and all mission-related activities.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could a person involved in such a case rise within the space agency, which is famous for its psychological screening of astronaut candidates?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Kanas, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied astronaut psychology, said that the screening occurs only at the very beginning of the process and that once an astronaut has gotten through the front door, the formal psychological evaluations give way to evaluation of job performance. Psychological counseling is available but not mandatory, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can screen out very serious stuff, but we can't always predict the future,'' Professor Kanas said, and ''people change over time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak first came to the space program in April 1996 and finally flew aboard the space shuttle in July 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 13-day flight of the shuttle Discovery, which was launched on July 4 of last year, she operated the robot arm during spacewalks with her crewmate Stephanie D. Wilson, earning them the shared nickname Robo Chicks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an astronaut she performed roles including capcom, the astronaut who communicates with orbiting space station crews.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Kanas said that most astronauts went through the experience of finally reaching space and came out well but that ''for some it's very difficult to adjust'' to seeing the abrupt end of something they have worked so hard to achieve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people are extremely well-suited, by personality and training, to deal with the stresses of being in space,'' Professor Kanas said. But, he added, ''that doesn't mean that they're not vulnerable to emotional problems, or problems in their relationships.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's astronauts find themselves in a world much less glamorous than the original crews. While the Mercury Seven raced Corvettes, today's family-oriented fliers are likelier to tool around in minivans. They spend much more time in suburbia than in orbit, and there are no more ticker-tape parades for the returning heroes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some former officials of the space program said that romantic thoughts and even love triangles were not unknown to the program but that it was up to management to watch carefully and intervene.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abbey, the former Johnson Space Center director, said, ''You've got some hard-charging people, and you need to manage them.'' Problems like this ''don't happen overnight,'' and so ''you have to be sensitive to what your people are doing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now and then on his watch, he recalled, ''I stepped in, and people weren't happy about it,'' he recalled, but it was important to tell them that ''whatyou're doing is not a personal thing for you -- it's affecting a lot of people around you, and affecting your performance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Kraft, NASA's original flight director, said he was surprised. If someone was slipping toward such trouble, Mr. Kraft said, ''your fellow crew members would pick that up.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak's use of a diaper on the long drive to Florida is no mystery to astronauts. Mike Mullane, a retired astronaut, said many astronauts wear a device -- ''we call them urine collection devices'' -- during launching, landing and spacewalks, ''when you're in a pressure suit and cannot get to a toilet.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other mysteries in the case could be more persistent. Michael Stone, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, said he was struck by the thoroughness of Captain Nowak's preparation, which he said was generally ''a guy thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's extraordinarily rare for a woman to do this type of a crime,'' Professor Stone said. He said the more customary response was to try to kill the object of affection, as Jean Harris shot Herman Tarnower in 1980. ''This is really close to unique in the annals of female crime,'' he said.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charge of attempted murder lodged against Capt. Lisa Nowak is not just a tragedy for the astronaut and her family. It strikes at the cherished image of astronauts as superior individuals who can cope with stresses that might crumple the rest of us. However the criminal charges are ultimately resolved, there is already a clear lesson of this bizarre case: astronauts are human, subject to the same marital strains and mental aberrations that afflict more ordinary mortals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency may need to revise its procedures for screening the psychological health of astronauts -- particularly those who might embark on long space trips. The agency is taking precisely the right action in beginning reviews of its screening procedures, from the time of application into the retirement years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently astronauts undergo a rigorous psychological and psychiatric screening to gain admission to the corps. But there are no formal psychological evaluations during their years of service thereafter, unless a medical doctor senses the need for one or an astronaut is scheduled for an extended flight on the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no evidence so far that any psychological problems interfered with Captain Nowak's well-regarded performance on her first and only shuttle flight last July. But it is unnerving that only seven months later, she drove more than 900 miles to confront a woman she deemed a rival for the affections of another astronaut. As the police described it, she wore a diaper to avoid stopping for rest breaks, carried an array of weapons, wore a wig and shot pepper spray into her rival's face.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident makes one suspect that NASA needs to provide more support for astronauts than the usual employee counseling programs. Captain Nowak's drama played out in an airport parking lot. Imagine a comparable scene at a base on the Moon or on a spaceship to Mars.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is reviewing its psychological screening and checkup process in the wake of the arrest of Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, the astronaut accused of attempted murder, space agency officials said yesterday. It will also try to determine whether ''indications of concern'' in Captain Nowak's case were overlooked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said, however, that her behavior had raised no obvious concerns recently and that she had been at work last week preparing for her job at mission control for the next shuttle flight, in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, of the Navy, flew back from Orlando, Fla., to Houston yesterday morning. She covered her head with a jacket as she got off a commercial airliner, and was taken to the Johnson Space Center, where she was given medical tests, a space agency spokesman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sad homecoming capped a tumultuous few days in which Captain Nowak drove more than 900 miles from Texas to Florida to confront an Air Force captain, Colleen Shipman, who she believed to be a rival for the affections of another astronaut. The police say Captain Nowak sprayed Captain Shipman with pepper spray at Orlando International Airport early Monday morning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, who wore diapers on the drive so she would not have to stop to relieve herself, took along a disguise, a compressed air pistol, a steel mallet, a knife, latex gloves and garbage bags, the police said. She was charged on Tuesday with attempted murder and released on bail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have said that this appears to be the first time that an active duty astronaut has been charged with a felony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Captain Shipman filed a request for a protective order against Captain Nowak. In that document, she stated that Captain Nowak had been stalking her for about two months and referred to the astronaut who officials say was the focus of Captain Nowak's jealousy, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy, as her ''boyfriend.'' She also said that she had not met Captain Nowak until the attack.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials said Captain Nowak's parents had gone to Houston from Rockville, Md., to help her, and that her husband was taking care of their children. The couple separated recently, the family has said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference in Washington, NASA officials described the events after Captain Nowak's arrest. Captain Shipman informed Commander Oefelein, who was on leave in Florida, of the attack. He contacted Ellen Ochoa, the director of flight crew operations early Monday. The director of the Johnson Space Center, Michael Coats, then dispatched Col. Steven W. Lindsey to Florida to ''offer any appropriate assistance.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrest set the agency's review process in motion, said Shana Dale, NASA's deputy administrator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday morning, NASA's administrator, Michael Griffin, ordered Mr. Coats to conduct the review of the space agency's initial psychological screening and ''ongoing psychological assessments during an astronaut's career,'' Ms. Dale said. Yesterday, he ordered a broader inquiry run from Washington that would use outside experts as well, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-level review process is intended to find out if astronauts are getting the ''level of psychological and medical care and attention they need,'' Ms. Dale said. Despite the review, she added, ''we think we're doing things very, very well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the case should have no long-term impact on the space agency's reputation, calling it ''a unique situation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency officials insisted that asking for help with emotional problems did not hurt an astronaut's chance of flying, but Dr. Jon Clark, a former NASA physician whose wife, Laurel Salton Clark, died in the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, said in an interview, ''What people say and what's reality are two different things.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Astronauts know there is a stigma attached to this stuff,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The psychological services are delivered only on demand, he said, which is a problem for self-reliant astronauts. ''They won't come to you and say, 'I've got a problem,' '' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak has been relieved of her duties and will not be involved in the shuttle mission scheduled to begin as early as March 15. She was going to be ''capsule communicator,'' or Capcom, relaying information to the astronauts aboard the shuttle from mission control. Substituting another astronaut into the position for the coming mission is relatively straightforward, said Col. Robert D. Cabana, the deputy director of the Johnson Space Center, speaking at the news conference from Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, the Johnson Space Center locked down for what could be a long media siege. The news media swarmed in the neighborhoods where NASA workers live, and helicopters from television stations flew overhead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA astronaut family support office sent an e-mail message to the spouses of astronauts saying that ''several astronaut families have been surprised by media representatives at their homes, and wished they had not opened their doors.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Use your own discretion if contacted by the press,'' the message read. ''However, check the credentials of anyone who contacts you to avoid a situation that could be awkward or even dangerous.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the space agency had no rules governing fraternization and infidelity among astronauts corresponding to such rules in the military. Ms. Dale said that NASA simply expects astronauts to conduct themselves in ways that will reflect well on the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Navy said that it is too early to even start considering whether the Navy will conduct its own investigation or press its own charges against Captain Nowak. Any procedure would come after the case has worked its way through civilian courts, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Houston, Colonel Cabana said that people at the Johnson Space Center are trying to cope with their surprise and sadness at the bizarre chain of events, but are also working to retain their focus on the continuing support of the International Space Station and the coming shuttle mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked his impression of Captain Nowak, Colonel Cabana said she ''was a vibrant, hard-working'' -- and then stopped himself briefly and started again, saying, ''is a vibrant, hardworking, energetic person who did her job very well.''  </p>

Leary contributed reporting from Washington, and Rachel Mosteller from Houston.  </div><div>854 words</div><div>9 February 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An astronaut's life can stretch family ties to the breaking point, and astronauts are not immune to emotional stress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That lesson is nowhere more obvious, experts and friends said, than in the case of Lisa M. Nowak, the Navy captain who was arrested early Monday on charges of attacking a woman in Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police say Captain Nowak considered the woman, Colleen Shipman, an Air Force captain, to be a rival for the affections of another astronaut, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak and her husband of nearly 20 years, Richard, separated some weeks ago, according to a statement this week from her family.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of marital discord in the astronaut corps,'' with the long absences and high pressure, Dr. Jon Clark, a former NASA physician whose wife, Laurel Salton Clark, died in the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Clark, who said the Nowaks were good friends with whom he and his wife had a great deal in common, said that life after a mission could have been very hard for Captain Nowak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're the rock star, you're at the high of your high, you have this great, wonderful, super-elevated moment in space,'' Dr. Clark said. ''You come back and you're cleaning up your kids' mess and cooking.'' What's more, he said, the astronaut returns to a husband who has been doing solo parenting duty and expects to get a break, only to hear, ''Hey, this is your problem now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be wrenching, he said, ''Some of those things can just conspire to nail you.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said that Captain Nowak attacked Captain Shipman with pepper spray in the parking lot of the Orlando airport; Captain Nowak was charged with attempted murder.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said they found such items as a knife, a steel mallet, rubber tubing, latex gloves and garbage bags in Captain Nowak's car, along with e-mail messages between Commander Oefelein and Captain Shipman, and Captain Shipman's travel plans, which Captain Nowak told the police that she had obtained from Commander Oefelein's computer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak had driven more than 900 miles from Texas to Florida to confront Captain Shipman, and the police said she wore adult diapers on the trip so that she would not have to stop to relieve herself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since her arrest, NASA has put her on 30-day leave and removed her from mission activities; she was going to work at mission control during the space shuttle flight in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials announced on Wednesday that the agency was reviewing its screening and psychological evaluation, and would try to determine whether signs of trouble with Captain Nowak had been missed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Captain Nowak and her parents were in her home in the Houston suburbs. It was not clear where her husband and children were.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an official NASA interview on the space agency's Web site from 2005, Captain Nowak, who has twin 5-year-old girls and a teenage son, talked about the way that NASA's intense training means ''a sacrifice for our own personal time and our families and the people around us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the unique aspects of an astronaut's life might draw attention, Lawrence A. Palinkas, an expert in astronaut psychology at the University of Southern California, said space travelers have sources of stress that would be recognized by many people in more earthbound careers -- and a similarly elevated rate of divorce rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any occupation where you have people spending a fair amount of time away from families -- perhaps the best analogy is military deployment -- you're going to have stress related to job demands,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts are not immune to stress, he said, though they are selected for emotional stability and trained to compartmentalize emotional issues and continue to perform on the job.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they intended to find out if they can do more to provide astronauts and their families with the support they need. In a telephone briefing with reporters yesterday, Ellen Ochoa, the director of flight crew operations at the Johnson Space Center, said that in the review of the space agency's psychological counseling services and procedures, ''we're going to be asking ourselves, 'Is there more that we should be doing post flight?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that NASA had no rules regarding relationships between astronauts, beyond general civil service, that govern relationships between bosses and subordinates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with reporters before her July flight, Captain Nowak said that with the space shuttle program winding down, she expected that her first flight could be her last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a good chance I won't fly again,'' she said. ''They don't need me to do another flight,'' because there are many astronauts with similar skills. But when asked if that was cause for regret, she quickly said, ''Of course it was worth doing it.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17 -- For nearly 50 years, Bob Morgan and his family have kept a box full of charred debris that they swear fell out of the early morning sky on Dec. 8, 1957.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My dad said it was glowing so bright that you couldn't look at it with your naked eye,'' Mr. Morgan said of the pieces of metal and plastic that came to rest behind his grandfather's house in Encino, Calif. ''So they grabbed some sunglasses until this thing had cooled down.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no one has ever confirmed what the objects were, Mr. Morgan has long believed that he has a piece -- or 13 pieces to be exact -- of one of the most famous objects ever to fly: Sputnik I, the first man-made object to orbit the earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts are skeptical, but Mr. Morgan has found a champion in an unlikely, but strangely connected, source: the Beat Museum, a small storefront collection of books and memorabilia of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and other writers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum, which opened in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco last fall, has made plans to sponsor a spring tour of Mr. Morgan's space scrap in a vintage Airstream trailer, creating a kind of Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test for the astronomy set.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Cimino, the founder of the for-profit museum, said he is mounting the exhibit as both a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Sputnik -- which was launched Oct. 4, 1957, and inspired the name Beatnik -- as well as something of an old-school, Merry Pranksters-style lark.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't call it a stunt, but there's nothing wrong to shouting out your message,'' said Mr. Cimino, 52, a former corporate computer salesman who started the museum in 2003 in Monterey, Calif. ''And if I can use this story to call attention to the message of the Beat Museum, which is tolerance, inclusiveness and having the courage to live your own individual dreams, that's a good thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan says it is not a hoax, and he does have some evidence for his theory, including a 1962 letter from the Air Force referring to the objects as ''the Sputnik parts,'' as well as schematic drawings from a 1950s Russian publication -- ''Technology for Youth'' -- showing a Sputnik with similar-shaped parts to those his family found. Some scientists also say that the pieces -- two hard, clear plastic rings and a series of smaller plastic and metal parts -- could have been part of Sputnik's booster rocket.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official story, according to NASA, is that Sputnik I -- which was about the size of a beach ball, with a radio transmitter and four dramatic tails -- re-entered the atmosphere in the early hours of Jan. 4, 1958, almost a month after Mr. Morgan's space junk landed. Most scientists think Sputnik I burned up before it hit the ground. But its exact demise remains a mystery.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Hargenrader, an archivist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said it is possible that what Mr. Morgan recovered is part of the final stage of the satellite's launching rocket, which was a much larger object, made up of 90 feet of aluminum. The final booster stage stayed in orbit with the Sputnik I and re-entered the atmosphere in early December 1957. News accounts at the time show that Soviet scientists believed that the rocket had re-entered over Alaska or the West Coast of North America.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Roger D. Launius, a space history curator at the National Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian, agreed that it was possible that Mr. Morgan's items were part of the booster but said the claim would face a heavy burden of proof.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to document its history since the point it originated,'' Mr. Launius said. ''If it dates to 1957, where was it found, who found it, and where has it been lo these many years? If you don't get good answers to those questions, there's good reasons to question it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan's grandfather tried to claim a reward for the pieces, giving them to military officials temporarily for inspection. In 1962, an Air Force colonel wrote a letter to the Morgans saying that although the family had ''recovered the Sputnik parts,'' there was no reward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan inherited the parts in the mid-1990s. He found schematic pictures of the original Sputnik and compared them to what he had. ''There's lot of pieces that resemble stuff, and there's a lot of pieces that don't,'' he said. ''But one of the pieces I have has the same screw-holes in the same places.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Hargenrader says that the Russian diagrams Mr. Morgan cites were most likely copies of pictures of American satellites reprinted in Russian magazines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, if the pieces are not Sputnik or its rocket, what are they?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Dickson, a historian and the author of ''Sputnik: The Shock of the Century,'' said the skies around Encino, in the San Fernando Valley, were probably very active in 1957, during the International Geophysical Year, a global effort to study geophysical phenomenon. ''The whole country was enmeshed in experimentation,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That year was also big for the Beats, a group that was also enmeshed in experimentation, with sex and drugs, and often in San Francisco. The Beats and the Sputnik are linked by nomenclature if nothing else: Herb Caen coined the word ''Beatnik'' in a newspaper column about a party held for ''50 Beatniks.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're only Beat, y'know, when it comes to work,'' Mr. Caen wrote in April 1958. Mr. Cimino says that connection alone would be enough for his museum to mount an exhibit. But both he and Mr. Morgan also say they would like to know the truth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the worst, I'd like someone to say this was a weather balloon launched three days before, and I know because I was there,'' Mr. Cimino said. ''If that's the answer, God bless America. But, wow: wouldn't it be great if it was true?''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder, Colo. -- AFTER years of spending our nation's space budget building an orbiting space station of questionable utility, serviced by an operationally expensive space shuttle of unsafe design, NASA has set a new direction for the future of human spaceflight. Once again, we have our sights on the Moon and beyond. We are finally, bodily, going to make our way into space, this time to stay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an opinion long and widely held within the space-exploration community that the Nixon administration's termination of the program that built the Saturn V Moon rocket was a gargantuan mistake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest challenges in exploring space is propulsion -- that is, getting from point A to B efficiently, safely and quickly. And when the cargo is human, the challenges are even greater. One of our crowning technological achievements during the 1960s was the Apollo program and, in particular, the development of the Saturn V rocket. The Saturn V was the largest, most powerful vehicle the United States had ever built. It had a launching capacity more than five times greater, a developmental cost 25 percent lower and a build-and-operate cost less than half of that of today's space shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those early days, the possibilities for human space travel were intoxicating. Back then, NASA plans called for an aggressive integrated human flight program that would expand on the developments of Apollo: the establishment of a 50-person lunar base, a 100-person Earth-orbiting space station and human landfall on Mars, all by the mid-1980s. Those plans also included a 50-person semi-permanent Martian base by the end of the 20th century. Instead, we went nowhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Because, largely for political reasons, we renounced the Moon, abandoned Apollo and the Saturn V and retreated to low Earth orbit, where we've spent the last 25 years going around in circles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost to the nation of this misstep was enormous. For starters, we lost an investment, adjusted for inflation to 2007 dollars, of $160 billion. That was the cost to get to, land on, walk on, drive on and otherwise explore the Moon. (Of that amount, $29 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, was the approximate cost of the Saturn V.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the production facilities for the Saturn V and the other lunar exploration components, like the command and lunar modules, were all closed. At that point, we lost both the technological means for human deep space exploration and the collective knowledge of tens of thousands of engineers and scientists trained in human spaceflight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally troubling is what we put in place of Apollo. The $38 billion developmental cost of the shuttle has gotten us nowhere in the solar system fast. And the International Space Station could have been built with only half a dozen Saturn V launchings instead of the more than two dozen shuttle trips that will be required to finish it. The bottom line: a colossal misuse of funds and a disheartening lack of progress and loss of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The termination of the Saturn V program also had a stifling effect on the robotic exploration of other planets. In essence, we lost the ability to deliver larger, and in some cases faster, payloads elsewhere in the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, as an example, the 5,600-kilogram Cassini spacecraft, which was launched in 1997 and is now in orbit around Saturn. Its launching was timed so that after spending two years looping around the inner solar system to pick up speed, it could rendezvous with massive Jupiter for an additional boost that would send it to Saturn. All told, its flight time took seven years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the Saturn V, modified with an appropriate fourth upper stage, been used to launch Cassini directly to Jupiter first, its flight time to Saturn could have been cut by more than half. In space, as on Earth, time is money, and the money saved could have been spent elsewhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, for the same flight time, a vehicle of greater launching capacity can deliver a heavier payload. Take as an example the 480-kilogram New Horizons spacecraft, launched over a year ago to fly by Pluto in 2015 and eventually to explore the Kuiper Belt of icy debris that lies beyond it. Had it been launched on a modified Saturn V rocket, New Horizons could have carried a payload that was 15 times heavier and far more scientifically capable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, instead of having a ubiquitous presence throughout the solar system, humans haven't set foot on the Moon in 35 years, and even our robotic explorations in that time have been throttled because we deliberately reduced our access to deep space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, however, NASA is again looking up and out. Vigorous efforts are under way to complete the space station in order to fulfill international commitments that would be unwise to violate. When that is done, the plan is to retire the space shuttle in 2010 in favor of a new program to return to the Moon, with a party of humans, by 2020. A mainstay of this program is the Ares launching system, capable of sending 65 metric tons to the Moon -- exceeding the capacity of the Saturn V by more than 40 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official plans call not for flag-planting and grab-a-few-rocks-and-go but, by 2025, a solar-powered, human-tended, continuously inhabited research outpost rising from either the north or south pole of the Moon, where sunlight is persistent and water ice may be present. Sustainability, made possible in part by the use of lunar resources, is one goal. Another is on-site preparations for a push to the next outpost, Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And human spaceflight is not the only enterprise to benefit. Robotic reconnaissance, which by necessity must precede the dispatch of humans, has been ongoing for nearly 50 years. In that time, all the simple things have been done. Future missions to the planets and their moons will be more ambitious than anything yet tried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one example, imagine what our future robotic travels around Saturn might be like. The Saturn planetary system includes Titan, a cold Mercury-sized moon with a dense, organic-laden, hazy atmosphere and a strangely Earth-like, variegated surface sculptured by winds and hydrocarbon rains. It also includes Enceladus, a moon one-tenth the size of Titan, whose jets of water vapor and fine icy particles extend thousands of miles into space and may very likely erupt from organic-rich liquid water reservoirs just below its surface -- making this satellite arguably the most promising target we have available to us for astrobiological investigation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A scientifically comprehensive mission to this part of the solar system, using Ares and a Cassini-like trajectory to Saturn, could easily include several exploratory vehicles. One would be a Saturn orbiter far more capable than Cassini. This vehicle, in turn, would be large enough to carry and deliver a fully equipped balloon-borne scientific payload to float through the atmosphere of Titan and study its surface up close, and an Enceladus lander with equipment that could determine the moon's physical properties and ascertain whether or not pre-biotic chemistry, and perhaps life, has arisen there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, robotic exploration, and the insights that will be gained from it into the character, development and evolution of planetary bodies and even life itself, will be taken to new heights and, in turn, pave the way for the eventual arrival of humans throughout the solar system. Anyone up for an extreme excursion to the Enceladus Interplanetary Geyser Park?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the subtext is invigorating and unmistakable: Humanity's future need not be confined to mere survival on our home planet. Other worlds beckon, we know how to reach them and we will once more be outward bound.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we will not be alone. China, India and Russia, all eager to be or remain prominent players on the world stage, have independent plans to stride the lunar surface. And Australia, Canada, Japan and the member nations of the European Space Agency will be pooling their resources with us in the return to the Moon -- a circumstance that will bring the cost of the effort to any one nation within reason.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS won't be a space race so much as a global exodus undertaken by an international community. And peaceful cooperation among nations, as a tangible means to build strong lasting international partnerships and defuse tensions and conflicts in the future, will be a welcome result.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, maybe the pace of progress was predictable. Humans first explored Antarctica in the early 20th century. Decades passed before we had the technology that would allow us to establish a permanent presence. History will indicate the same for our interplanetary forays. Our initial ''small step for a man'' on the Moon took place in 1969. A half-century later, we will be there anew, to live and work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reach that future will require two critical ingredients: adequate financing and a long-term cross-administration commitment that supports steady, uninterrupted progress. Our first reach for the Moon took us from President Kennedy's spoken words to the lunar surface in little over eight years under a budget profile that saw peaks in annual NASA budget of more than $30 billion in current dollars -- a shocking number by today's standards and a good measure of how important we then considered the endeavor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sustained budgets of that magnitude are out of the question today, what is not out of the question is our ability to pay to keep the goal front and center. We are now spending in Iraq, in a single month, $9 billion -- more than half the annual budget NASA needs to stay on course.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-five years ago today, John Glenn Jr. became the first American to venture into orbit around the Earth. Just 9 years old, I knew at that moment that the future would be big and wide, and that I might go places no one had ever been before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There could be no better way today to encourage an equally optimistic belief in the future than to embark on an odyssey that presents tremendous challenges, demands discipline and rigor, requires decades-long focus, inspires international cooperation, promotes lasting peace, improves life for all and paints a stirring vision of an expanded human presence beyond the Earth. There could be no better way to say: the future is boundless, and it belongs to us.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the alien planet weather report: scorching, dry, dark and windy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said yesterday that the most extensive examinations yet of the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars was most noteworthy for what they did not see: namely water, a substance predicted by virtually all theories of planet formation, not to mention the essential ingredient for life as we know it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The steam that was predicted to be there was nowhere to be found,'' said L. Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richardson led one of three teams that reported the results of observations of two planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope in a telephone news conference yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richardson's results are being published in Nature today. His data suggest that at least one of the planets is swaddled in high-level clouds of dark dust. ''The water could still be there,'' he said. ''We just can't see it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the work was another steppingstone in the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Mark Swain at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the leader of a second team, called it ''a dress rehearsal.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was also in keeping with the history of planets orbiting other stars, or extrasolar planets, which has been nothing but a series of surprises over the last 10 years as planetary systems out there have so far looked nothing like our own. Alan Boss, a theorist at the Carnegie Institution who was not involved in the work, said: ''This is a field where observers are leading the way. The scorecard should read, 'Observers 200, Theorists 0.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was a member of a third group, led by Carl J. Grillmair of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, described the extrasolar bodies as ''blacker than any planet in the solar system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a sense,'' Dr. Charbonneau said, ''we're getting our first sniffs of air from an alien world.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of the planets studied are so-called hot Jupiters, gas giants that circle their home stars in tight hot life-defying orbits. And both pass directly in front of their stars and then behind them, as seen from Earth. One, known as HD 209458b, with a surface temperature of about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, circles a Sun-like star about 150 light-years away in Pegasus at a distance of about 5 million miles every 3.6 days. (Mercury, the closest planet to our Sun, is 36 million miles from it.) Five years ago, a group led by Dr. Charbonneau using the Hubble Space Telescope detected traces of sodium in the planet's atmosphere as it was backlighted by its home star.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other planet, known equally charmingly as HD 189733b, is 62 light-years away in Vulpecula, circling a reddish star slightly smaller than the Sun every 2.2 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The groups analyzed the planets' atmospheres by using the Spitzer Space Telescope to record their spectrum of infrared, or heat, radiation. The planets are too overwhelmed by their stars' glare to be imaged directly. But by subtracting Spitzer observations of the star when the planet was behind it from observations when the planet and star were both visible, the astronomers could obtain the spectrum of the planet itself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richardson's group first did this for the Pegasus planet in July 2005, but analyzing the data took longer than it expected. All Spitzer data become public after a year, so Dr. Swain's group took up the analysis as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to theoretical models, molecules like water and carbon dioxide should have produced bumps and wiggles at characteristic wavelengths in the planets' spectrums. Instead, the spectrums were virtually flat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a member of Dr. Richardson's team, said the lack of such features was ''truly exciting.'' Dr. Seager explained that in so-called brown dwarfs, failed stars that are the closest thing to the hot Jupiters, water vapor dominates the spectrum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many ways, she said, that the water could be there but hidden from our view.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea, which has gained some support from Dr. Richardson's analysis, is that high clouds could mask the atmosphere. Dr. Richardson's spectrum has a broad bump at a wavelength of 9.6 microns, which he says is consistent with emission from heated dust grains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Swain said he did not claim to have detected the dust feature.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By NICHOLAS BAKALAR  </div><div>505 words</div><div>27 February 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers may have found another star to add to the Southern Cross, one of the most familiar constellations in the southern sky. Beta Crucis, the bright star that forms one arm of the cross, apparently has a small companion undetectable by optical telescopes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other binary stars, the two appear to be bound by gravity, orbiting around each other. The discovery was incidental to the aims of the team's research. While using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the stellar winds of Beta Crucis, researchers found two sources of X-rays instead of the one that they expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding new companion stars is not an especially rare event in astronomy. Beta Crucis has another companion star that has been known for some time based on wobbles that it causes in the Beta Crucis orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this latest discovery is surprising, ''because we think it's a star of the 11th magnitude, which should be fairly easily detectable,'' said Michael Kuhn, a senior at Swarthmore College and a co-author of a paper published last month in The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may be that Beta Crucis is so bright that it completely overwhelms the area,'' Mr. Kuhn said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beta Crucis, about 16 times the size of the Sun and 350 light-years from Earth, is brighter than all but 18 stars in the night sky.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Wolk, a staff scientist at the Chandra X-ray Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., who was not involved in the research, said the work ''appears essentially incremental -- most good work is -- but finding a young sun hiding in such a well-known and easy-to-find spot always makes you feel a bit more accepted by the universe.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new star is probably about the size of the Sun and relatively young, at 11 million years old. It is more than 37 billion miles from Beta Crucis, or 400 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This image is evidence that the new X-ray source is a star that is physically associated with the Beta Crucis system,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''But we still need follow-up observations to conclusively prove it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five countries -- Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Samoa -- display the Southern Cross on their flags.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Beta Crucis is a star near the end of its life, according to David Cohen, the lead author of the paper and an associate professor of astronomy at Swarthmore, no one need fear that the designs will become obsolete. Beta Crucis, Dr. Cohen said, will continue to outshine everything nearby for at least the next few million years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Photos: ''New Companion''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have discovered a companion to Beta Crucis, an arm of the Southern Cross constellation featured on the flags of several countries.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 -- The New Horizons spacecraft, launched from Earth by NASA some 13 months ago, is moving in for a close encounter with Jupiter on Wednesday that should let it test its suite of instruments before being flung off toward the distant target of Pluto and its trio of moons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The half-ton, atomic-powered robot craft is to make more than 700 observations of Jupiter and its four largest moons by June. A period of high-intensity observations began last Saturday and will peak after the craft makes its closest approach to Jupiter on Wednesday, passing 1.4 million miles from the center of the giant planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter's gravity will accelerate the spacecraft by 9,000 miles per hour, flinging it toward Pluto at 52,000 miles per hour. Even with the speed boost, which knocks off three years of travel time, New Horizons will take eight more years to reach the Pluto system for a close-up look in July 2015, when Pluto will be 3 billion miles from Earth, a distance requiring almost four and a half hours for a radio signal to pass between them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our highest priority is to get the spacecraft safely through the gravity assist and on its way to Pluto,'' said Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the mission's principal scientist and team leader. ''But this is also a big stress test for our primary mission to Pluto. We want to exercise our spacecraft hard enough to turn up any problems and to fully test our procedures.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons is powered by a small plutonium-fueled electric generator, and its instruments include three cameras, for visible-light, infrared and ultraviolet images, a space-dust collector and three spectrometers to study the chemical composition and temperatures of the worlds it investigates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Spencer, a mission scientist who is also from the Southwest Research Institute, said New Horizons carried more advanced instruments than any of the seven spacecraft that previously visited Jupiter and would be making unique observations. ''We will not be repeating what has already been done,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists plan for the spacecraft to make three-dimensional movies of the turbulent area near Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot, a centuries-old giant hurricane; examine auroras above the atmosphere in different wavelengths of light; and make the first edge-on observations of the planet's tenuous ring system in hopes of finding some tiny satellites there, Dr. Spencer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will also make a major study of Jupiter's enormous magnetosphere, a cocoon of charged particles from the Sun that are trapped and channeled around the planet by its magnetic field. In the months after the Jupiter fly-by, plans call for New Horizons to make the first trip down the magnetosphere's long tail of high-energy particles that extend tens of millions of miles beyond the planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the data collected during the Jupiter encounter will be recorded aboard the spacecraft and sent back to Earth days or weeks later, just as New Horizons is scheduled to do when it makes its closest pass by Pluto, its large moon Charon and the smaller satellites Nix and Hydra on July 14, 2015.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months after the Jupiter encounter, the $700 million project will go to sleep for much of the cruise period to Pluto. New Horizons will be put into a ''hibernation mode'' with most of its systems and instruments turned off to reduce wear and tear and to save power. Operators are to wake the spacecraft once a year during the long journey to check its status and correct its flight path.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Shuttle Flight Postponed After Damage From Hail  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ  </div><div>492 words</div><div>28 February 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has postponed next month's space shuttle launching because of thousands of dings and gouges from a hailstorm, mission managers announced yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hailstorm, which caught the shuttle at the launching pad, caused ''the worst damage we have ever seen'' to the insulating foam on the shuttle's external fuel tank, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, in a briefing from Cape Canaveral, Fla. There were two dozen blemishes on the left wing of the shuttle Atlantis, though preliminary analysis suggests no serious damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hailstorm blew through the Kennedy Space Center at 5 p.m. on Monday with wind gusts of 62 miles per hour and golf-ball-sized hail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is, at this point we do not believe we can make the launch window for March,'' Mr. Hale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle will have to be rolled back to the hangar for assessment and repairs, missing a launching opportunity for a construction mission to the International Space Station that begins on March 15 and extends to March 25. The next opportunity would come after a visit to the station by a Russian Soyuz vehicle in April, so the earliest launching will not come until late April, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If NASA has to swap out the current external tank, Mr. Hale said, the mission would be delayed until June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the shuttle was protected by a gantry at the launching pad, the top of the tank extends well above the structure and sustained the greatest damage, said John Chapman, the manager of the external tank project office for the space agency. The number of ''divots'' might be as high as 7,000, Mr. Chapman said, but far fewer would require repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some shallow dings can be sanded smooth, while others will be filled with pourable insulating foam and sanded. The damage to the wing's insulating tiles might require cosmetic repairs, though further assessment will take place, officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foam that covers the external tank has been a source of risk and worry for the space program since the earliest days, because foam falling can damage the delicate thermal tiles and panels that protect the orbiter from the punishing heat of re-entry. The shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven were lost in February 2003 after a chunk of insulating foam struck the left wing during ascent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttles have sustained hailstorm damage that required repairs and delay before two other missions, in 1990 and in 1999. In the 1999 mission, NASA counted 460 divots, said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for the Kennedy Space Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that despite the latest delay he believed that the launching scheldule had enough flexibility to allow the five flights that are planned for this year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 -- The craft that is to replace the space shuttle could be delayed because of recent budget reductions, pushing its first missions into 2015 instead of 2014, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, told a Senate committee on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said the reductions could shift money from the development of the Orion crew vehicle and the Ares I rocket. That would widen by four to six months the period in which the United States could not send humans into space after the shuttle is retired in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said other nations would continue to fly people and cargo into space while the United States was grounded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the United States not to be among them is tragic,'' he said, adding: ''When you don't fly for four or more years, people become stale. Very good people often move into other enterprises where there is more action. Facilities degrade. It's not a good thing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the hearing, before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Mr. Griffin said a chance remained that the Orion's first missions could come in December 2014. But he warned that it would not be possible if early development money was reduced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the committee's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the ranking Republican, repeated their hope for limiting the ''gap'' in American manned space flight. Mr. Nelson said that it was a national security issue and that he would push for more money for the shuttle replacement in a supplemental spending bill this spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration has proposed a $17.3 billion budget for NASA in the 2008 fiscal year, a 3 percent increase over the previous year. Mr. Griffin said the proposal demonstrated President Bush's commitment to space leadership and was enough to keep NASA on track.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said NASA's biggest planning problem was the resolution the president signed on Feb. 15 that froze 2007 spending at the previous year's level because Congress had not passed separate spending bills before the end of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appropriation reduces overall NASA financing by $545 million from the original 2007 request. In addition, Mr. Griffin said, the measure directed $677 million in specific reductions in the agency's human space flight budget, including $577 million from the program developing the Orion, to be redistributed to other NASA programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is that we are down about half a billion dollars, and most of that came from the Orion Program,'' Mr. Griffin said. Developing the Orion will cost $10 billion, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said NASA was studying a space station safety report released on Tuesday by an independent panel of experts. The report noted risks to the International Space Station from orbiting debris and micrometeoroids, among other concerns. NASA had already been working on most of those problems, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every day, there is about a one in 100,000 chance that the space station will be critically damaged by a piece of orbital debris,'' Mr. Griffin said, ''It's not great, but the risk is there.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla., March 6 -- The space shuttle pilot at the center of a love triangle, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein, was in orbit in December when he was sent a steamy e-mail message from a girlfriend awaiting his return: ''First urge will be to rip your clothes off, throw you on the ground and love the hell out of you.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another woman, Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, a fellow astronaut, apparently discovered that message, along with other romantic messages to Commander Oefelein, before she set off a month ago on a 900-mile road trip that brought her here to confront her rival for the commander's affections.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The e-mail message was among several hundred pages of documents released this week by prosecutors in the case against Captain Nowak, who is charged with trying to kidnap the message's writer, Capt. Colleen Shipman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The messages, and statements taken from Commander Oefelein and Captain Shipman, confirm publicly for the first time that Commander Oefelein had a romantic relationship with Captain Nowak. It lasted two or three years before he broke it off to date Captain Shipman late last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Oefelein said he had considered Captain Nowak, like himself a Navy officer, to be one of his best friends at NASA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He met Captain Shipman, an Air Force officer, while training in Florida several weeks before his December trip aboard the shuttle Discovery. They sent e-mail to each other regularly, even while he was in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detectives say they found the messages between Commander Oefelein and Captain Shipman in Captain Nowak's possession when she was arrested in Orlando on Feb. 5, the day she confronted Captain Shipman here. Commander Oefelein and Captain Shipman told investigators that they believed the messages had been taken from a computer in his apartment. Captain Nowak had a key to the apartment.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI, March 7 -- Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, accused last month of attacking a romantic rival for the affections of a fellow astronaut, was fired from NASA on Wednesday, agency officials said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a NASA statement. Captain Nowak was dismissed because the agency ''lacks the administrative means to deal appropriately with the criminal charges'' against her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were she a civil servant, NASA would have had the choice of placing Captain Nowak on administrative leave without pay or indefinite suspension until the charges are resolved, a NASA spokesman said. But because she was an officer, those options were not available.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Captain Nowak will return to the Navy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Hartsfield, a NASA spokesman, said the termination of Captain Nowak, who has been charged with attempted kidnapping, ''does not reflect any position by NASA'' on the criminal case against her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hartsfield added that he believed it was the first time NASA had asked the military to take back an astronaut. It is also the first time an active-duty astronaut stands accused of committing a felony.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, a Navy veteran who flew aboard the space shuttle last year, drove more than 900 miles on Feb. 5 wearing a diaper to avoid having to stop to use the bathroom and confronted Capt. Colleen Shipman of the Air Force in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport, attacking her with pepper spray, officials say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On her cross-country trip, she carried a compressed-air pistol, rubber tubing, a knife and a steel mallet. Captain Nowak had learned that Captain Shipman was romantically involved with Cmdr. William A. Oefelein, a shuttle pilot with whom Captain Nowak also had a relationship.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Navy spokeswoman, Cmdr. Lydia Robertson, said Wednesday that Captain Nowak had orders to report on March 21 to work as a staff member for the chief of naval air training in Corpus Christi, Tex.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak is currently on leave from the Navy and living in Houston. She has been released from jail pending trial, though she must wear an electronic monitoring device.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's dismissal of her came as no surprise to her or her lawyer, Donald Lykkebak, said a spokeswoman for Mr. Lykkebak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Navy has decided to reserve judgment against Captain Nowak pending the outcome of her case.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said last week that it couldn't afford to hunt for all potentially Earth-threatening space objects, ensuring for now that the odds are that civilization wouldn't know about a lethal asteroid or comet until it hit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency currently supports several search programs that use telescopes to find objects over a kilometer (about sixth-tenths of a mile) in diameter that cross the Earth's orbit. There are an estimated 1,000 of them, and about three-quarters have been discovered, their orbits calculated, and the potential for global catastrophe ruled out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a report to Congress, NASA said that because of budget constraints, it could not undertake any new programs to find smaller asteroids, up to about 450 feet in diameter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists who study near-Earth objects say the collision risk is very real. But the odds of a major impact in the average lifetime is very low -- perhaps 1 in 100,000, according to David Morrison, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center who is an authority on impact hazards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morrison said he preferred not to talk about risk but about the need to find whatever is out there. ''It's like walking across Broadway with your eyes closed,'' he said. ''You'd rather look and see. We're not looking and seeing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that even a 450-foot-diameter asteroid would cause major destruction, Dr. Morrison and others spend time thinking about what to do if a space rock is found to have the planet's number on it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference last week in Washington, the latest ideas were discussed. One was using a nuclear bomb to blow up a rogue asteroid, as Bruce Willis did in the 1998 film, ''Armageddon.'' He landed on the asteroid and drilled into the rock, leaving a bomb behind.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But asteroids are thought to be odd rocks -- porous agglomerations of smaller bits, more like popcorn balls than baseballs. A nuclear blast from within an asteroid might simply break it into several pieces that could continue on the same trajectory and do as much or more damage to Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option would be a nuclear detonation on the asteroid's surface or above it. Such a blast would cause some of the rock on one side to vaporize and send the asteroid in the other direction. Given enough lead time, even a slight course change would be more than enough to send the rock out of harm's way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another scheme calls for a ballistic impact -- hurling a few tons of nonexplosive material at high speed at the asteroid to knock it off course. There's also the gravity tractor, a hovering spacecraft that would use only its gravitational pull to tug the rock into a different orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other ideas are less practical. Perhaps the most far-fetched is a proposal to change the color of the asteroid, making it darker or lighter so that it absorbs and re-radiates more or less sunlight, affecting its spin and, eventually, its orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most scientists consider this idea intriguing but unrealistic, a paper in the current issue of the journal Science shows that the effect of sunlight on small asteroids, while slight, is significant. So it's not unfathomable that someday the survival of the planet could depend on what might be called the Rolling Stones approach: ''I see an asteroid, and I want it painted black.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 11 -- NASA can find and track most of the nearby asteroids that could hit and damage the Earth, but there is not enough money in its budget to finish the project within a 15-year deadline mandated by Congress, according to an agency report released Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said there were about 20,000 asteroids and comets orbiting relatively close to our planet that could deliver blows ranging from destroying cities to ending all life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These objects, 150 yards to more than a mile in diameter, represent about 20 percent of the asteroids and comets whose paths routinely pass between the Sun and the Earth's orbit, it said. Rather than trying to detect, track, catalog and characterize all of the more than 100,000 ''near Earth objects,'' as Congress asked in a 2005 NASA authorization bill, the study said it would be more realistic to focus on those representing a real potential hazard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But accomplishing this by 2020 would require using ground-based telescopes sponsored by other agencies for other purposes, possibly building a dedicated observatory for finding and tracking hazardous bodies and launching a spacecraft to observe the space around Earth from Venus. Such an undertaking, the report said, would cost more than $1 billion that the agency does not have.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Due to current budget constraints, NASA cannot initiate a new program at this time,'' it said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA runs a program called the Spaceguard Survey to track the largest potentially hazardous objects, those greater than 3,300 feet in diameter that could devastate most life if they hit. That is what scientists believe happened to the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago. This program, using ground-based observatories, is budgeted at $4.1 million a year through 2012.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald K. Yeomans, director of the Spaceguard program, said that there were believed to be 1,100 of these larger objects and that the survey had cataloged about 73 percent of them. The initial goal of tracking 90 percent of them should be reached by 2010, more than a year later than originally planned, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yeomans, attending a planetary defense conference here last week at George Washington University, said the goal of surveying 90 percent of potentially hazardous objects could be reached more cheaply than in the NASA study by using only ground-based observatories. But Congress would have to change its goal from 2020 to 2026, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building, launching and operating a deep space orbiting infrared observatory to complete the task more quickly could cost an additional $700 million, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Ailor of the Aerospace Corporation, a not-for-profit Air Force research group that sponsored the planetary defense conference, said the problem of finding killer asteroids could be solved more easily if more countries were involved. Interest is growing, he said, noting that the European Space Agency is considering a mission called Don Quijote to test ways to deflect an asteroid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Should one nation, the United States, be responsible for the entire planet?'' Mr. Ailor asked.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TIBURON, Calif. -- AMERICANS who read the papers or watch Jay Leno have been aware for some time now that there is a slim but real possibility -- about 1 in 45,000 -- that an 850-foot-long asteroid called Apophis could strike Earth with catastrophic consequences on April 13, 2036. What few probably realize is that there are thousands of other space objects that could hit us in the next century that could cause severe damage, if not total destruction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week two events in Washington -- a conference on ''planetary defense'' held by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the release by NASA of a report titled ''Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives'' -- gave us good news and bad on this front. On the promising side, scientists have a good grasp of the risks of a cosmic fender-bender, and have several ideas that could potentially stave off disaster. Unfortunately, the government doesn't seem to have any clear plan to put this expertise into action.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, Congress gave NASA's Spaceguard Survey program a mandate of ''discovering, tracking, cataloging and characterizing'' 90 percent of the near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer (3,200 feet) wide by 2008. An object that size could devastate a small country and would probably destroy civilization.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus at the conference was that the initial survey is doing fairly well although it will probably not quite meet the 2008 goal. Realizing that there are many smaller but still terribly destructive asteroids out there, Congress has modified the Spaceguard goal to identify 90 percent of even smaller objects -- 460 feet and larger -- by 2020. This revised survey, giving us decades of early warning, will go a long way toward protecting life on the planet in the future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that scientists feel we have the technology to intercept and deflect many asteroids headed toward Earth. Basically, if we have early enough warning, a robotic space mission could slightly change the orbit of a dangerous asteroid so that it would subsequently miss the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two potential deflection techniques appear to work nicely together -- first we would deflect the asteroid with kinetic impact from a missile (that is, running into it); then we would use the slight pull of a ''gravity tractor'' -- a satellite that would hover near the asteroid -- to fine-tune its new trajectory to our liking. (In the case of an extremely large object, probably one in 100, the missile might have to contain a nuclear warhead.) To be effective, however, such missions would have to be launched 15 or even 30 years before a calculated impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news? While this all looks fine on paper, scientists haven't had a chance to try it in practice. And this is where NASA's report was supposed to come in. Congress directed the agency in 2005 to come up with a program, a budget to support it and an array of alternatives for preventing an asteroid impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of coming up with a plan and budget to get the job done, the report bluntly stated that ''due to current budget constraints, NASA cannot initiate a new program at this time.'' Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, was right to say that ''NASA's recommended approach isn't a credible plan'' and that Congress expected ''a more responsive approach'' within the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did the space agency drop the ball? Like all government departments, it fears the dreaded ''unfunded mandate''; Congress has the habit of directing agencies to do something and then declining to give them the money to do so. This is understandable. But in this case, Congress not only directed NASA to provide it with a recommended program but also asked for the estimated budget to support it. It was a left-handed way for the Congress to say to NASA that this is our priority like it or not. But for some reason NASA seems to have opted for a federal form of civil disobedience.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with the report was that, while it outlined other possibilities, it estimated that using a nuclear-armed missile to divert an asteroid would be ''10 to 100 times more effective'' than non-nuclear approaches. It is possible that in some cases -- such as an asteroid greater than a third of a mile across -- the nuclear option might be necessary. But for the overwhelming majority of potential deflection cases, using a nuclear warhead would be like a golfer swinging away with his driver to sink a three-foot putt; the bigger bang is not always better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the concern? First, even with good intentions, launching a nuclear-armed missile would violate the international agreements by which all weaponry is banned from space. Second, the laws of probability say we would be struck by such a large asteroid only once every 200,000 years -- that's a long time to keep a standing arsenal of nuclear asteroid-blasters, and raises all sorts of possibilities of accidents or sabotage -- the old ''cure being worse than the disease'' phenomenon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, of course, this is not just America's problem, as an asteroid strike would be felt around the globe. The best course is international coordination on deflection technology, along with global agreements on what should be done if a collision looks likely. Along these lines, the Association of Space Explorers, a group of more than 300 people from 30 nations who have flown in space (of which I am a member), is beginning a series of meetings in cooperation with the United Nations to work out the outlines of such an agreement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as with many global issues, little will be accomplished unless the United States takes the lead. With the entire planet in the cross hairs, NASA can't be allowed to dither. If Congress's mandates and budget requests aren't energizing the agency, perhaps public hearings would shame it into action.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometime, probably several billion years ago, a rocky iceball almost as large as Pluto crashed into another almost Pluto-size iceball.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazingly, the pieces that flew apart from that long ago smash-up are still easily identifiable in the night sky, astronomers reported last week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have pieces we can put back together again,'' said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of an article describing the discovery in the current issue of the journal Nature.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown turned up the first piece in December 2004 during a systematic search for large bodies hiding beyond Neptune in a ring of debris known as the Kuiper Belt. Given the time of year, he gave that Kuiper Belt object the nickname Santa. (A couple of weeks later, the same search turned up a Kuiper Belt object larger than Pluto, precipitating the events that led to the demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet last year.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa, with a mass about one-third that of Pluto, is an oddball. It is shaped like a football, stretched out because it spins end over end once every four hours. It is made mostly of rock, but has an outer layer of shiny water ice. It has two moons, nicknamed ''Rudolph'' and ''Blitzen.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid spinning and the two moons were hints of a past collision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Kristina M. Barkume, one of Dr. Brown's graduate students, was measuring the reflectivity of about 30 Kuiper Belt objects to infrared light. Six were noticeably different, absorbing a specific wavelength corresponding to the presence of ice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them was Santa, which is also known by the more formal designation 2003 EL61.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists looked up the orbits of the other five Kuiper Belt objects on the list. ''It was instantaneously obvious,'' Dr. Brown said. '' 'Oh my God, these things all have the same orbit, and they have the exact same orbit as Santa.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers have since found two additional Kuiper Belt objects that are shards from the same impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculations suggest that the pre-impact Santa was about 1,000 miles wide, or about two-thirds the width of Pluto. It collided with another object perhaps 700 miles wide at a speed of perhaps 7,000 miles per hour. That impact pulverized most of Santa's outer layers of ice, leaving the rocky core, Dr. Brown said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's telling us something very important about the early evolution of the solar system, and we're still trying to figure that out,'' said Harold F. Levison, a planetary scientist at the  <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s department of space studies in Boulder, Colo. ''It was a surprise, no doubt about it. When I first heard about it, I didn't believe it, but the paper convinced me.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kuiper Belt is believed to have once been much denser and originally closer to the Sun, but was later pushed outward by the migration of the giant planets like Neptune. However, those changes would have pushed apart the orbits of Santa and its brethren, so the observation that all are still in the same orbit means the collision that formed them must have occurred after the Kuiper Belt settled in its current location, Dr. Levison said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That in turn brings up the question of how seemingly unlikely it was that the collision occurred at all. Only a handful of objects in the current Kuiper Belt are larger than 500 miles wide, and it is highly unlikely that two would ever cross paths.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levison said he had worked out a possible solution. In the past, a higher number of Kuiper Belt objects traveled in elliptical orbits, and two of those must have been the ones that collided.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa will not be around forever. It is in a resonant orbit with Neptune, traveling around the Sun 7 times for each 12 orbits of Neptune. That resonance is unstable, and in about a billion years, Neptune will give Santa a gravitational push into the inner solar system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Santa can make it past Jupiter, which deflects many such interlopers from the outer solar system, it will turn into a giant comet. ''It'll be most spectacular thing that anyone has ever seen -- if anyone is around to see it,'' Dr. Brown said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other fragments must have also been kicked inward by Neptune, which raises the possibility that at least some observed comets are also pieces of Santa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is pure speculation,'' Dr. Brown said. But he added, ''That's one of the things I like to think about that might be really true.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''When Worlds Collide''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simulations can help scientists understand the dynamics of collisions in deep space. In this example, two objects, each about 2,000 kilometers in diameter, collide at low speed, ejecting about 1 percent of their mass into space.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. -- The old-timers still talk of manned rockets and raucous nights at the space cowboy roadhouses, the Moon Hut and the Mouse Trap, places where yesterday's gravity resisters could raise a beer to honor the Moon and missions thereabouts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since those days, a whole generation has known space travel only by the shuttle, its orbital perambulations practically terrestrial by comparison. But in a quarter-century of blastoffs here, that bulky, snub-nosed, imperfect craft has gained its own set of admirers and collectors along this space coast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We watched this huge monument leave the planet. It was awesome; it was goose bumps,'' said Brenda Mulberry, owner of the Space Shirts souvenir shop. ''Every one's been just as exciting to me.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes the long goodbye.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On presidential orders to return to lunar exploration, NASA has vowed to retire its shuttle fleet by 2010, leaving the last scheduled missions to the whims of weather, mechanics and luck. The next launching of the Atlantis awaits repairs to the bruises from an earthbound storm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because the spaceflights are sporadic, there's 14 of them left if I'm not wrong,'' said Scott Andrews, a camera company representative who developed a trigger system for photographing active launching pads. ''People are looking at the big draw for the area now as the cruise ports.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around Merritt Island and the nearby towns about 45 miles east of Orlando, the impending shuttle retirement can evoke memories of 1972, when the end of the Apollo program set parts of the local economy adrift. But today the side-by-side hotels of Cocoa Beach are filled with college students on spring break, the Denny's restaurants are filled with retired couples, and the Port Canaveral billboards list the departures of five cruise lines. It is not Walt Disney World East, but then, the century is young.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all that business, the space shuttle occupies the kind of sentimental hole other cities plug with sports franchises. After 116 missions, several triumphs, two great disasters and a general loss of interest in many quarters of the country, hope, resolve and some measure of nostalgia resound in a place where the telephone area code is 3-2-1 and where, the tourism board says, ''dreams are launched.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has announced intentions to deploy a new craft called Orion by 2015, and Ms. Mulberry has already started rendering it on T-shirts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This new rocket is a little difficult, I will tell you,'' she said, holding a design that incorporated pictures of Earth, the Moon, some satellites and a couple of manatees. ''It's not as pretty as the shuttle.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mulberry came here in the early days of the shuttle program and found a husband at Bernard's Surf, a legendary astronaut haunt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He told me he worked on the space shuttle,'' she said. ''I laughed at him. I said, 'What's a space shuttle?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today a rocking two-seater shuttle replica sits outside her store, and an inflatable shuttle hangs from the ceiling. ''The T-shirts will continue, whether they build a new vehicle or they don't,'' Ms. Mulberry said. ''But I believe they will. I believe we're going to the Moon again.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Indian River in Titusville, where the better bars advertise ''Bikers Welcome,'' the Shuttle Car Wash and Space Shuttle Fuels pay modest tribute. The Columbia and the Challenger are depicted on license plates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Best Western Space Shuttle Inn, Room 178 has a bed with a distinctive black-and-white nose for a headboard and rudders and elevons at the base. A portal on the wall depicts Earth as seen from space. The room costs $139 a night, a $60 premium over its neighbors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes locals will call up and say, 'Hey, you got the space shuttle room open?' '' said Cindy Schellenberg, a desk agent. ''People stay here on full nights and say, 'That's the weirdest room I've ever stayed in.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decor dates to a long-ago owner whose name has slipped Ms. Schellenberg's mind, a Dutchman who drove a shuttle replica built atop a motorcycle. The hotel, she said, will probably keep its name.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hate to see the shuttle program end, but there's always enthusiasm for the next step,'' Ms. Schellenberg said. ''I'd like to see them go to the Moon.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the road to the launching pad, Shuttles Bar and Grill is decorated with eight-foot portraits of the craft in flight. A sign on the door says ''Shoes and Shirt Required; No One Under 21 After 9 p.m.; Non-Smoking Not Available.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the place is a roadhouse of the classic American style, complete with barn ceiling, pool table and lighting fixtures by Budweiser. In some photographs astronauts pose in orange flight suits and 1980s haircuts; in others the shuttle and its rocket boosters roar into cloudless skies trailed by golden plumes of fire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope they don't shut it down, because that's why we're here,'' said a waitress, Kim Kolata, 24. ''I remember, as a kid, coming up here. The shuttle launch would go off. You'd feel the ground shake. It was pretty exciting.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kolata was reminded of NASA's plan to return to the Moon, an adventure that has not been tried in her lifetime, not since the days of the fearless test pilots who drank at the Moon Hut. She gazed away for a second, seeming to gather her thoughts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do you think,'' she asked, ''they really went to the Moon?''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 13, Charles Simonyi won a Junior Astronaut competition in Hungary that earned him a trip to Moscow to meet one of the first cosmonauts. This week, on Saturday, the former Microsoft engineer who oversaw the creation of the ''Word'' and ''Excel'' software programs is scheduled to depart on a roughly 12-day orbital flight to the International Space Station on a Soyuz TMA spacecraft, along with two cosmonauts. Having paid about $25 million to Space Adventures, a privately owned space tourism company, Mr. Simonyi will become the fifth civilian space tourist to pay for the out-of-this-world experience.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simonyi will not only orbit the earth at approximately 17,500 kilometers per hour, he will also assist in space station research and share a six-course meal -- prepared by the French chef Alain Ducasse from a menu chosen by Martha Stewart -- with the crew. Mr. Simonyi's Web site and blog (  www.charlesinspace.com  [http://www.charlesinspace.com]) is already loaded with images (including a hilarious video of him doing weightless exercises in the zero G simulator), and has a ''Kid's Space,'' with a link where children can pose questions about space travel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space Adventures (  www.spaceadventures.com  [http://www.spaceadventures.com]) also offers zero gravity and centrifuge training at more down-to-earth prices -- $3,500 and $7,795 respectively. Or for a mere $100 million per seat you can become part of the first private expedition to the moon. Like its destination, though, it is still a long way off.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Samuel Ting, the Nobel Prize-winning particle physicist, proposed back in 1995 to use the International Space Station to plumb the depths of the universe for antimatter, it was hailed by NASA as good news for the station, which suffered from the perception that it had no scientific use. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting's mission had undeniable heft. His experiment would sift cosmic rays, the high energy particles from the Sun, other stars and even galaxies whizzing through outer space, with unprecedented sensitivity and precision, opening in effect a new window on the universe. By looking for the evil twin opposites of ordinary matter, he and his collaborators hoped to shed light on why the universe appears to be made overwhelmingly of matter, although the laws of physics, including Einstein's E=mc2, suggest that matter and antimatter should have been born in equal amounts in the Big Bang. Are there reservoirs of antimatter somewhere way out in space? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of a few antigold nuclei or antihelium ions streaming from an antistar in some distant antigalaxy would rock science, but even if they didn't find antimatter, Dr. Ting and his team argued that they might detect signals from the mysterious dark matter that accounts for 25 percent of the universe, or see some other significant surprise. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't know what you are going to get,'' he told Science magazine in 1996. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after more than 10 years and $1.5 billion, the 15,000-pound detector is nearly ready for the cosmos, the product of 500 scientists from 56 institutions and 16 countries, including China and Taiwan, welded together by Dr. Ting's organizational energy. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, as it is known, is one of the most expensive scientific experiments ever built. A blue-ribbon panel of physicists appointed by the Energy Department affirmed last fall that the instrument had the potential to make ''fundamental new discoveries.'' By the end of next year, the project's managers expect to ship it to the Kennedy Space Center. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only hitch is that NASA says it no longer has the space to fly its once-prized project. The experiment was dropped from the space shuttle manifest after the Columbia burned up in 2003 and NASA shifted gear and decided to retire the shuttles by 2010. All the remaining flights are booked, either to finish the space station or to revisit the Hubble Space Telescope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So absent a change of heart by NASA, or the infusion of more money, Dr. Ting's experiment could languish for all eternity in a NASA clean room. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope that's not true,'' Dr. Ting said by telephone from CERN, the nuclear laboratory outside Geneva where the detector is being assembled, adding that as a particle physicist he reported to the Department of Energy, not NASA. ''My responsibility is to build the detector.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''I hope it gets used, otherwise it would not be good for everyone.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the experiment itself, the standoff represents a clash between two of the more strong-willed and brilliant leaders of Big Science in America: Dr. Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is known for his autocratic management style and obsession with detail, and Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, who has shown himself willing to make tough calls in reshaping the space program away from the shuttle and toward the Moon and Mars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The loss of Columbia was a huge loss for the entire United States space program aside from the deaths of seven people,'' Dr. Griffin said recently in an interview. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sam is the one guy we deal with who has not accepted this with reasonable grace,'' he said. ''He continues to insist that he is a special case. I'm sorry, but he's not.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another level, many scientists say, the standoff is a test of American credibility in international science. NASA signed an ''implementing arrangement'' with the Department of Energy in 1995, agreeing to fly the Alpha experiment on the station if the department built it. It was on the basis of that document, and a 1998 memorandum of understanding signed by representatives of some two dozen institutions around the world, Dr. Ting says, that scientists from Europe and Asia were able to raise money from their governments for the detector. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Smoot, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and Nobel laureate himself, who served on the blue-ribbon review panel, said, ''The real issue is does NASA stand up to its commitments to the D.O.E. and the rest of the world?'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology, who led the recent review, said, ''It's a crime to make that kind of investment and then walk away from it.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paradoxically, NASA has cited international commitments as a reason to complete the space station. Mark Sistilli, NASA's project manager for the experiment, noted that it too is ''a major, major international project.'' He emphasized that it had not been canceled and that NASA would continue to get the experiment ready just in case. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Energy declined to comment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting, who won the Nobel in 1976 for his part in discovering the so-called J/Psi particle in 1974, conceived the idea for his space antimatter experiment in 1993 after the United States canceled a giant particle accelerator, the Superconducting Supercollider, narrowing the options for traditional high-energy physics on the Earth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting decided to look instead to the sky. ''The highest energy particles are only produced with cosmic rays,'' he said. ''No matter how large an accelerator you have, you can never compete with cosmic rays.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Daniel S. Goldin, NASA's administrator at the time, Dr. Ting's idea was heaven-sent, and he put it on the fast track to space. Not only would it add cutting-edge science to the space station, but it would cost NASA little beyond a pair of shuttle flights. Under the agreement, the Department of Energy was responsible for building and testing the detector. Indeed, the vast bulk of the $1.5 billion for the project, Dr. Ting said, came from Europe and Asia. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heart of his experiment is the two-ton magnet. Its field, 20,000 times as strong as that at the Earth's surface, is produced by current flowing through superconducting coils cooled to 1.8 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero. That was what took 12 years and cost so much money, Dr. Ting said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A magnet is essential because charged cosmic rays bend direction in a magnetic field. By measuring the degree and direction of the bend, physicists can identify the cosmic particles. Protons and antiprotons would bend in opposite directions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Dr. Ting said, is that magnets in orbit tend to rotate to stay aligned with the Earth's own magnetic field as they go around the Earth. That would wreck the experiment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It took us some time to design a magnet that won't turn,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting's group flew a prototype of their experiment successfully on the shuttle in 1998. The second flight was to be three years on the space station. But delays in the shuttle schedule and the Columbia disaster intervened. Last year an Italian-led collaboration launched a smaller cosmic ray satellite named Pamela that has begun to nibble away at some of the science the Alpha spectrometer was supposed to do. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Dr. Griffin became NASA administrator in April 2005, however, the experiment, he said, had been dropped from the shuttle manifest. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months after taking office, he received a briefing from Dr. Ting. Dr. Griffin was unmoved about the use of the shuttle. ''It essentially uses up most of a shuttle flight,'' he said of the experiment. ''Without adding a flight, we don't have the payload.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he subsequently asked Mr. Sistilli to look into alternative ways to get the experiment to space. But the possibilities, ranging from launching it on an unmanned rocket and leaving it parked in space until the shuttle could pick it up, to making it into a free-flying satellite, would cost anywhere from $225 million to $1 billion, Mr. Sistilli said. Asked who would pay, Mr. Sistilli said, ''That's the big question.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, he said, is still pondering what to do. ''The science and the international commitment are something you can't ignore,'' Mr. Sistilli said. ''Stay tuned.'' </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much effort should we expend to ward off the possibility that an asteroid might some day collide with Earth? Space experts attending a recent conference in Washington lamented the failure of the federal government -- indeed, of the entire world -- to take the threat seriously enough. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at virtually the same moment, advised Congress on steps that could be taken to find and divert threatening asteroids only to conclude that it couldn't afford them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems shortsighted. The risk is remote, but the consequences are potentially catastrophic. It would seem wise, at a minimum, to look harder for any death-dealing rocks that might menace us.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The encouraging news is that the most horrendous hazards -- asteroids like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs or even smaller objects whose impact could disrupt the global environment -- have mostly been identified under a $4 million-a-year survey program. The space agency estimates that there are some 1,100 near-Earth objects whose diameters exceed six-tenths of a mile, big enough to destroy a medium-sized state and kick up enough dust to affect global climate and crop production. The survey has already identified more than 700 of them. None are on a path to collide with Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More troublesome is the threat of smaller asteroids, greater than 460 feet in diameter (about one-seventh the threshold of the really scary big ones), that could devastate a region but not the whole globe. NASA estimates that some 20,000 of these might be potentially hazardous; it has identified only a fraction of them. Two years ago Congress asked NASA to propose new search programs and to analyze ways to divert any asteroids on a collision course with Earth. The agency did that in a March report to Congress, but it balked at the notion of spending up to $1 billion or more to build search instruments or spacecraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is understandable. NASA is burdened with the need to finish the space station, build a successor to the shuttles, return to the moon and conduct wide-ranging research. It already has more jobs to perform than money to perform them. But finding asteroids that might threaten the planet, and studying their characteristics in the process, is probably more important than at least some of the other robotic missions mounted by NASA. Congress should either add funds to the agency's budget, or the agency should divert funds from other programs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing ways to deflect asteroids is more problematic. NASA suggests that the best solution would be to explode a nuclear bomb next to an asteroid to deflect it off course, but international aversion to nuclear weapons in space would make that approach difficult without a global consensus. Other experts favor a high-speed ballistic impact or using the gravitational attraction of a hovering spacecraft to nudge the asteroid off course. Before plunging ahead with an asteroid-deflector, let's wait to see whether a real threat even exists.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 17, Charles Simonyi slipped out of Soviet-controlled Hungary to seek freedom. At 33, he slipped away from the safety of a large corporation, Xerox, in search of fortune at a young start-up named Microsoft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today, at 58, that fortune is allowing him to slip the surly bonds of Earth, at least for a couple of weeks, to visit the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simonyi is the fifth so-called space tourist -- a phrase those who buy the flights dislike -- and by a large margin the wealthiest. A software pioneer who led the teams that gave the world Microsoft Word and Excel, he has amassed a personal fortune of about a billion dollars, according to Forbes Magazine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of wealth has bought him two jets -- which he pilots himself -- and a 233-foot-yacht, along with other expensive toys. In comparison to an average American family's worth, the estimated $20 million he paid to blast off in a Soyuz spacecraft is the equivalent to something like a visit to an amusement park or a weekend getaway.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A trip to outer space is actually, for someone like Charles, a logical step,'' Martha Stewart said in an e-mail message from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, where she has gone to see her friend launched into space and to film the event for her television program. Ms. Stewart called Dr. Simonyi ''intrepid, inquisitive, curious and actually very bold,'' adding that his adventure had created a wish to take a trip of her own.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those with less means than Ms. Stewart to buy a ticket can follow Dr. Simonyi's trip on his Web site, CharlesinSpace.com, which details the months of preparation for the flight, including gaining zero-gravity experience aboard an airplane, survival training, working in a spacesuit and practicing helicopter rescues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He follows four other space tourists -- Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen and Anousheh Ansari -- whose trips were arranged by  <span class="companylink">Space Adventures Ltd.</span>, a company in Vienna, Va.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview from Russia, Dr. Simonyi said he would spend his time in space photographing Earth and taking part in experiments. Many involve things like blood tests, he said, so ''I'm more the experimental subject than the experimenter.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has prepared for the possibility of the nausea many space voyagers encounter with Russian conditioning methods that include riding in a spinning chair and sleeping with his legs elevated above his head. ''It's one of those don't try-it-at-home things,'' he said, explaining that it left his head feeling bloated and heavy. ''It's the feeling that you're going to get a headache, but you don't.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like any good guest, he will take a gift: takeout. Ms. Stewart selected the menu, and Alain Ducasse, the French chef, prepared it for April 12, Cosmonauts Day in Russia. The meal includes quail roasted in Madiran wine, duck breast confit with capers and semolina cake with dried apricots.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simonyi will fly up with Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov, both Russian cosmonauts, and return with Mikhail Tyurin, a cosmonaut, and Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, who are finishing their six-month mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip caps a lifelong interest in space and technology for Dr. Simonyi. At 13, he won a contest to be Hungary's ''junior astronaut'' and met a cosmonaut in Moscow. As a student, he punched holes in paper tape to program the Soviet Ural-2 computer. Wanting to read English-language accounts of the United States' space program, he said, was ''one of my motivations in learning English.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His interest stayed strong; in his first year at Microsoft, he persuaded another space enthusiast, Paul G. Allen, to fly to Florida for the first space shuttle launching. Mr. Allen, now one of the world's richest men, has pursued his own interest in space by paying for the development of SpaceShipOne, the small craft that won the Ansari X Prize in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simonyi said that he admired those who were trying to bring about a new space industry, but that when it came to space: ''I am not an entrepreneur. I'm a customer.'' (His company, Intentional Software, is creating a product to simplify the process of writing computer programs.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tech-millionaire-turned-space-entrepreneur, Elon Musk, said that being a private astronaut ''does not do much to advance the greater cause of space exploration,'' which he said was best furthered by companies like his, SpaceX, which has won a NASA contract to ferry astronauts to the space station after the space shuttle program shuts down in 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Simonyi's part, he said he was just happy to be finally on his way. He said he fully understood the risks of space travel, like the station's being hit by orbital space debris, but added that in relative terms, ''the actual risk is very small.'' Besides, he said, ''if you ask whether I'd like to be in a head-on collision on the freeway or be hit by orbital debris, it's the latter.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, to tie his past to his present adventure, he is taking a paper tape from the Ural-2 with him to orbit.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ   </div><div>439 words</div><div>11 April 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much-delayed launching of the space shuttle Atlantis is being pushed back again into June as NASA struggles to repair thousands of gouges on the craft's hail-pocked fuel tank, officials said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was to begin in mid-March, and the shuttle had already been rolled to the launching pad in February when the hailstorm occurred. Much of the shuttle is protected by a gantry that is moved away before launching, but the 15-story-tall external fuel tank, with its distinctive coating of orange insulating foam, pokes out well beyond the top of the structure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delicate foam at the top of the tank suffered thousands of dings. Many have to be carved out and filled, one at a time, with new foam. Two areas of the tank were so peppered that workers were spraying on whole sections of foam, a process that had not been tried before at Kennedy Space Center. NASA has put that process through extensive testing to ensure that it is safe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials had hoped that the mission might begin in May, but the pace of repair made that impossible, they said last night. They had also been weighing whether to swap the damaged tank for one that was intended for a later flight, which would have caused further delay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling foam is a threat to the safety of the shuttle and its crew. In 2003, the shuttle Columbia and its crew were lost during the return to Earth because of a hole in the wing caused by a chunk of foam during ascent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay means a later return to Earth for Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who is aboard the International Space Station. Commander Williams's return was scheduled for the shuttle mission after this one, which was to occur in June. With the June launching of Atlantis, the next mission will not be until August at the earliest. William H. Gerstenmaier, who heads manned space operations for NASA, said the agency might bring Commander Williams back on the earlier flight if it was delayed ''into July or later.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for getting Atlantis off the pad by June, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, ''We don't see any showstoppers in front of us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to push the launching into June also casts doubt on NASA's plans for four shuttle missions this year, down from the five missions first announced. N. Wayne Hale Jr., the manager of the shuttle program, said, ''Flying four flights is not outside the realm of possibility.''   </p>

</div><div class="author">By DENNIS OVERBYE   </div><div>382 words</div><div>12 April 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There might be water beyond our solar system after all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alien planet that appeared to be dry, dark and dusty has water in its atmosphere, an astronomer said yesterday, but some of the astronomers who had made the earlier observations said his conclusions might be premature.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as HD 209458b, circles a Sun-like star about 150 light-years away in Pegasus, passing between its star and Earth every 3.6 days. Last winter, two teams using the Spitzer Space Telescope failed to find signs of water in its atmosphere, causing consternation among planetary theorists.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All their models indicate that water vapor is one of the fundamental elements of planetary composition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new work, Travis Barman of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., made numerical models of the planet's atmosphere, assuming there was water. Dr. Barman then compared them with measurements made with the Hubble Space Telescope when light was shining through the edge of the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of its star.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble observations were made by a team led by Heather Knutson, a graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The correlation between the bumps and wiggles predicted and observed, Dr. Barman said, ''is a powerful clue that water is present.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without water, the results would not match, he said in an e-mail message. ''Water has been predicted to be present by many models (not just mine) for a long time,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Barman said the earlier Spitzer observations, which were announced in February, might have failed to find water because they were made when the planet was passing behind its star, fully illuminated from the front. That situation, observers say, could make it difficult to see water even if it were there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Charbonneau of Harvard, a member of Ms. Knutson's team and a longtime student of the planet, called Dr. Barman's results ''intriguing,'' but cautioned that he might be misreading the Hubble results, which were published in the Astrophysical Journal in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper, Dr. Charbonneau said, pointed out that some of the Hubble data might be due to the telescope and instrument, not the planet.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the line to get into the Imax theater at the American Museum of Natural History seems long enough to stretch all the way out to other planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it does.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This weekend ''Beyond,'' a one-year exhibition of more than 30 large-format photographs of Earth's planetary neighbors, opens in the museum's Imax Gallery, a corridor by the theater that is also a pathway to the Rose Center for Earth and Space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Benson, a writer, photographer and filmmaker, created the stunning series of pictures from the enormous archives of images taken over the years by robotic explorers of the solar system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone with an interest in astronomy and an Internet connection can find the raw images at sites like   www.nasa.gov  [http://www.nasa.gov], and NASA occasionally releases photographs of breathtaking beauty. But the artist's eye can transform what started as scientific data, and even the best of NASA's pictures on a newspaper page or a screen do not give a hint of the richness of these prints.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in 1995 Mr. Benson spent years sifting through hundreds of thousands of photographs, looking for those that offered an aesthetic punch. He then painstakingly combined images, using digital tools like Photoshop, to eliminate dropouts and blurs from individual photos beamed back across millions of miles of space. A lovely picture of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, gliding in front of the swirling atmosphere of that planet, for example, is a blend of some 70 frames sent back by Voyager.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images come from as far back as 1970s explorations by space-faring robots like Mariner 10, the Viking Orbiters and Voyager. More recent ones come from Cassini, which is sending data back from the outer planets, and the plucky rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are still motoring around the surface of Mars. Many are drawn from the multiyear project that culminated in Mr. Benson's 2003 book, ''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes'' (Harry N. Abrams); they provide views of hothouse Venus, desertlike Mars and two decidedly otherworldly moons of Jupiter: Io and Europa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These photographs have the power to startle, especially those that capture the freaky beauty of erupting volcanoes on Io and the intensely detailed patterns of fractures of Europa's icy surface. The Valles Marineris canyon system, spanning 2,500 miles of desert on Mars, has a kind of dust-bowl beauty, and the surface of Venus, as peeked at by radar through its covering of sulfuric acid-laden clouds, seems sadly spectral.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it art if a robot snaps the shutter? In a response to questions by e-mail, Mr. Benson, an American who lives in Slovenia, said, ''Although I didn't take the actual shots, I feel very much the author of the final composite image.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result, he wrote, is that the images of the ''exquisitely flawed pearl'' that is Europa and the ''lurid and orange and volcanic'' Io provide ''something stranger than 'Star Trek' or 'Star Wars' ever came up with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked whether there was any message he would like to get across with the photographs, he began with a joke, ''Uh, that they're for sale?'' (They are.) But he switched to a more serious tone to say there were earthly lessons in the extraterrestrial sights. ''Venus is the victim of a runaway greenhouse effect, with solar radiation that's trapped by its clouds producing a heat on its surface hot enough to melt lead,'' he wrote. ''Mars by contrast lost much of its atmosphere and is a frigid desert. Both once had surface oceans, which they have entirely lost.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth, of course, is not likely to see anything that extreme. As with real estate values, planetary comfort is largely a matter of location, location, location -- in the solar system. But as visual metaphors for environmental extremes, Mr. Benson's images nonetheless have a way of taking hold in the mind.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it circled Mars longer than any other spacecraft, the Mars Global Surveyor did not die a death of old age last November, a review board assembled by NASA announced yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, an errant computer command five months earlier had been placed in the wrong location of the computer memory for the spacecraft. That, in effect, implanted a fatal defect in the spacecraft, disabling a safety feature to prevent the solar panels from rotating too far and mangling its ability to communicate with Earth in case of a mishap.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Nov. 2 , a run-of-the-mill command to the Global Surveyor set off the latent time bomb. Because the safety feature had been disabled, the solar panels rotated as far as they could, causing the spacecraft to ''think'' erroneously that the panels had jammed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its last 13-minute contact, the Global Surveyor reported numerous alarms to mission controllers but gave no indication that it was in immediate danger.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spacecraft tried to recover, it ended up in an orientation such that the Sun was shining directly on a battery, causing it to overheat. The Global Surveyor misinterpreted that signal, sensing that it had overcharged the battery and stopped charging its other battery, as well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, because the June error caused the craft's antenna to point in the wrong direction, mission controllers on Earth could not get in touch with the craft again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a sort of unfortunate concatenation of events,'' said Dolly Perkins, deputy director-technical of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who was chairwoman of the review board.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within half a day, the Global Surveyor batteries drained dead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chain of events leading to the craft's doom started in September 2005 on a routine technical update. For redundancy, the information was copied to two separate locations in the computer memory, but at different times with slightly different values. That led to a slight inconsistency, and when the engineers tried to repair that in June, they caused the bigger problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review board said that the mission team had properly followed its procedures, but that the procedures were inadequate and that more thorough checks of its commands could have found the errors before they were sent to the spacecraft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Global Surveyor was launched in 1996 and arrived at Mars 10 months later. After gradually moving into a circular orbit, its science mission started in March 1999 and was to last one Martian year, or 687 Earth days, until January 2001. But the spacecraft continued operating long after that, sending back more than 240,000 photographs.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will try to launch four space shuttle flights in 2007 to continue building the International Space Station, managers for the agency said. The launching dates will be June 8 for the Atlantis; Aug. 9 for the Endeavour; Oct. 20 for the Discovery and Dec. 6 for the Atlantis. NASA officials also announced dates for two of next year's flights, although more shuttle missions are expected in 2008, including one to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. The Endeavour is scheduled to be launched on Valentine's Day in 2008 and the Discovery is set to fly again on April 24, 2008. NASA managers had hoped to squeeze five shuttle flights into 2007, but a postponement in launching the Atlantis made that impossible and created launching delays for the rest of the year.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, April 20 -- A contract worker brandishing a revolver took control of part of a Johnson Space Center building on Friday afternoon, and killed a hostage and then himself after a standoff with the police.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another hostage, identified as Fran Crenshaw, was not harmed. After the three-hour standoff, F.B.I. agents and the police began trying to figure out what relationship, if any, the gunman had with the hostages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know what any of the relations were at this time,'' Capt. Dwayne Ready of the Houston police said of the three people involved in the incident. ''I am sure we will learn if there were any relationships, and what they may have been.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Ready said the police had not found any note by the gunman, identified as Bill Phillips. The police later searched his house for clues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The male hostage, David Beverly, was fatally shot in the initial minutes, the authorities said. Three hours later, the police heard another shot. They then found the gunman with a fatal gunshot to the head.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the space center security office received a call at 1:40 p.m. that a man had shot a gun twice in Building 44, which houses communications and tracking equipment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA security officers, working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Houston police, surrounded the building. A SWAT team prepared to storm the building but took control of the building methodically, knowing that the gunman had barricaded himself in a second-floor office.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police shepherded employees, mostly engineers for spacecraft tracking, outside, directing them to a nearby firehouse. Operations were not interrupted elsewhere at the space center, officials said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police tried for three hours to contact the gunman, who officials said worked for  <span class="companylink">Jacobs Engineering</span>, a subcontractor at the space center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John W. Prosser, an executive vice president for  <span class="companylink">Jacobs Engineering</span>, said, ''Our understanding is the person involved is an employee.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Prosser said he would not give more details. The police said the man was 50 to 60 years old.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building 44 has offices and a few laboratories to support tracking spacecraft like the International Space Station and the space shuttle. It is a block west of Mission Control and not far from the main gate for employees and visitors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security at the center is not tight for employees. Metal detectors are not used. Visitors have to apply for temporary entry badges, but full-time employees and contractors bear cards that they show to guards at the gates. Except for occasional high security periods, people with hard passes come and go freely.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for NASA, Eileen Hawley, suggested that security policies would be reviewed.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most enticing property yet found outside our solar system is about 20 light-years away in the constellation Libra, a team of European astronomers said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers have discovered a planet five times as massive as the Earth orbiting a dim red star known as Gliese 581.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the smallest of the 200 or so planets that are known to exist outside of our solar system, the extrasolar or exo-planets. It orbits its home star within the so-called habitable zone where surface water, the staff of life, could exist if other conditions are right, said Stephane Udry of the Geneva Observatory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are at the right place for that,'' said Dr. Udry, the lead author of a paper describing the discovery that has been submitted to the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he and other astronomers cautioned that it was far too soon to conclude that liquid water was there without more observations. Sara Seager, a planet expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ''For example, if the planet had an atmosphere more massive than Venus's, then the surface would likely be too hot for liquid water.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the discovery in the Gliese 581 system, where a Neptune-size planet was discovered two years ago and another planet of eight Earth masses is now suspected, catapults that system to the top of the list for future generations of space missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the treasure map of the universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X,'' said Xavier Delfosse, a member of the team from Grenoble University in France, according to a news release from the European Southern Observatory, a multinational collaboration based in Garching, Germany.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who studies the structure and formation of planets, said: ''It's 20 light-years. We can go there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet was discovered by the wobble it causes in its home star's motion as it orbits, using the method by which most of the known exo-planets have been discovered. Dr. Udry's team used an advanced spectrograph on a 141-inch-diameter telescope at the European observatory in La Silla, Chile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, Gliese 581c, circles the star every 13 days at a distance of about seven million miles. According to models of planet formation developed by Dr. Sasselov and his colleagues, such a planet should be about half again as large as the Earth and composed of rock and water, what the astronomers now call a ''super Earth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most exciting part of the find, Dr. Sasselov said, is that it ''basically tells you these kinds of planets are very common.'' Because they could stay geologically active for billions of years, he said he suspected that such planets could be even more congenial for life than Earth. Although the new planet is much closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, the red dwarf Gliese 581 is only about a hundredth as luminous as the Sun. So seven million miles is a comfortable huddling distance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How hot the planet gets, Dr. Udry said, depends on how much light the planet reflects, its albedo. Using the Earth and Venus as two extreme examples, he estimated that temperatures on the surface of the planet should be in the range of 0 degrees to 40 degrees centigrade.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just right in the good range,'' Dr. Udry said. ''Of course, we don't know anything about its albedo.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem is that the wobble technique only gives masses of planets. To measure their actual size and thus find their densities, astronomers have to catch the planets in the act of passing in front of or behind their stars. Such transits can also reveal if the planets have atmospheres and what they are made of.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Udry said he and Dr. Sasselov would be observing the Gliese system with a Canadian space telescope named MOST to see if there are any dips in starlight caused by the new planet. Failing that, they said, the best chance for more information about the system lies with the Terrestrial Planet Finder, a NASA mission, and the Darwin missions of the European Space Agency, which are designed to study Earthlike planets, but have been delayed by political, technical and financial difficulties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are starting to count the first targets,'' Dr. Udry said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How soon till we can get to the Goldilocks planet? Don't cash in your frequent flier miles yet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers announced last week that they had found what might be the first habitable planet outside the solar system. Known poetically as Gliese 581c, the new planet is only five times as massive as the Earth and inhabits a sweet zone around a dim red star in Libra where it is neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water. The star and its retinue of planets are only 20 light years away. ''We could go there,'' enthused Dimitar Sasselov, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, noting that 20 light years is next door in a galaxy 100,000 light years across. But he was speaking for the very, very long term. However near cosmically, the Gliese planet is still about 120 trillion miles away. Voyager 1, now leaving the solar system at a speed of about 39,000 miles per hour, would need more than 300,000 years to travel that far.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists and engineers point out, however, that it is possible to attain much higher speeds with spacecraft that undergo a gentler but steady acceleration throughout the trip, rather than getting a short violent boost at the beginning like Voyager and current rockets do. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University, and author of ''The Physics of Star Trek,'' said that a ship that could maintain an acceleration equivalent to the gravity felt on Earth would attain a velocity of half the speed of light in three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology for that much oomph is nowhere in sight, but NASA has experimented with gentler versions like solar sails, in which the spacecraft is propelled by sunlight, or ion drives, pioneered on a spacecraft named Deep Space 1, which visited a comet in 2001, in which high-energy particles do the propelling. This year a new spacecraft, Dawn, will use ion propulsion to begin a cruise around the asteroid belt. But even ion drives have to carry prohibitive amounts of fuel to reach the stars, said Marc Rayman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Dawn's project system engineer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take Dawn 10,000 days and 5,000 pounds of propellant to get up to 150,000 miles per hour, which is only .02 percent of the speed of light, ''which is nothing,'' said Dr. Rayman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's an illustration of how daunting this travel is,'' he said. ''The distances are vast, the challenges are extraordinary.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have any doubt that humankind will eventually have the technology to send spacecraft that distance,'' he said, adding, ''I have no idea how it will be done.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sasselov said that in the long run, in order to survive planetary catastrophes, we would want to make the trip, by whatever means.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have to go next year or even in the next 20 years,'' Dr. Sasselov said. But eventually, he said, ''if we figure out our human affairs down on here on Earth, we'll want to be moving along.'' DENNIS OVERBYE   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being the size of Jupiter and made mostly of hydrogen, a planet around a star 440 light-years away is denser than Earth, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., announced. The astronomers were able to measure the size of the planet, designated HAT-P-2b, because it passes directly in front of the star every 5 days and 15 hours, causing it to dim slightly. HAT-P-2b, in the constellation Hercules, is more than eight times the mass of Jupiter, and the immense gravity crushes the planet down to its relatively small size and Earth-like density.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the way to Pluto, the New Horizons spacecraft has provided planetary astronomers their first close-up look in several years at Jupiter and its moons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary reason for the Jupiter flyby in February was a gravitational slingshot that accelerated the New Horizons by 9,000 miles an hour to its current speed of 52,000 miles an hour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the New Horizons was in the neighborhood anyway, its cameras zoomed in on sights like the Little Red Spot, a smaller version of the famous Great Red Spot, Jupiter's thin rings and the volcanic eruptions on Io, a Jovian moon. The encounter also gave the New Horizons team a chance to practice and prepare for a Pluto visit in July 2015.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've really learned how to drive this spacecraft,'' said S. Alan Stern, associate administrator of NASA for the science mission directorate and the principal investigator for the New Horizons mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference last week, scientists working on the mission presented a sampling from 700 observations taken on the flyby.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spacecraft approached, it had a good view of boulders in Jupiter's narrow rings and of the way two tiny moons, Metis and Adrastea, nudged and shepherded them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the best-ever views we've ever received of Jupiter's rings,'' said Jeff Moore of the Ames Research Center in California, who led the science effort during the flyby. ''By incredible good luck, we happened to be on the right trajectory with the right instruments.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the flyby, the New Horizons took rearview photographs of sunlit dust particles in the rings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Little Red Spot formed over the last 10 years, when three smaller storms in Jupiter's atmosphere merged, and is now about half the diameter of the Great Red Spot that has swirled for 300 years. Over the last year, the smaller spot has become redder, presumably as it sucks up colored materials lower in the atmosphere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one image, the scientists combined a color photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope with a more detailed black-and-white image from the New Horizons.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons flyby coincided with large eruptions on Io, the most geologically active body in the solar system. By luck, the craft was able to capture a plume from the volcano Tvashtar rising 200 miles into space.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaboom indeed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a cascade of superlatives that belies the traditional cerebral reserve of their profession, astronomers reported yesterday that they had seen the brightest and most powerful stellar explosion ever recorded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cataclysm -- a monster more than a hundred times as energetic as the typical supernova in which the more massive stars end their lives -- may be an example, they said, of a completely new type of explosion. Such a blast, proposed but never seen, would explain how the earliest and most massive stars in the universe ended their lives and strewed new elements across space to fertilize future stars and planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is quite possibly the most massive star that has ever been seen to explode,'' said Nathan Smith of the University of California, Berkeley, who estimated it as ''freakishly massive,'' about 150 times the mass of the Sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Smith led a team of astronomers from Berkeley and the University of Texas who have submitted a paper about the supernova to The Astrophysical Journal and discussed the results yesterday at a news conference from NASA headquarters in Washington. ''We're really excited about this,'' he said. ''If it really is what we think it is, it forces us to rethink how massive stars die.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have been following the star since last September, when it was discovered in a galaxy 240 million light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The discovery was made by Robert Quimby, a University of Texas graduate student, who was using a small robotic telescope at McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Tex., to troll for supernovas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star bears an eerie resemblance to Eta Carinae, a star in our own galaxy that has been burbling and bubbling in the last few centuries as if getting ready for its own outburst. The observations suggest that the troubled and enigmatic Eta Carinae, thought to weigh in at about 120 solar masses, could blow up sooner than theorists have thought. Mario Livio, a theorist at the Space Telescope Science Institute who was not involved in the research, said Eta Carinae's death could be ''the most spectacular star show in history.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cautioning that theorists still did not know for sure what had caused the explosion announced yesterday, Dr. Livio said: ''Here we have the brightest supernova we have ever observed, and we don't know the explosion mechanism. It doesn't get any more exciting for a theorist.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such supermassive stars are extremely rare in the modern universe but are believed to have been common among the first stars that formed when the universe was less than a billion years old. The blast raises astronomers' hopes that the next generation of bigger telescopes, like NASA's coming James Webb Space Telescope, will be able to detect these stars by their explosions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ironically, we might first detect the first generation of stars by their deaths,'' said Alex Filippenko, another team member from Berkeley.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supernovas come about in two basic ways: explosions of small stars about one and half times the mass of the Sun, which are known as white dwarfs and are uniform enough to serve as cosmological distance markers; and the collapse of the cores of more massive stars into black holes or neutron stars when their thermonuclear fuel has run out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers first suspected that the supernova's dramatic output was caused by the shock wave of a white dwarf exploding into a dense cloud of hydrogen. When observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory failed to find enough X-rays to support that idea, the group was forced to consider an alternative: that the luminosity was produced by the decay of radioactive nickel. But to match the observations, the star would have had to produce 22 solar masses of radioactive nickel -- way off scale for the core collapse model.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In desperation, the astronomers turned to a theory proposed nearly 40 years ago by Zalman Barkat of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his colleagues. The intensity of radiation in the cores of supermassive stars could be so great, they said, that pairs of electrons and their antimatter opposites, positrons, would be created.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is bad news for the star,'' Dr. Livio said, explaining that the disappearance of the radiation would sap the core's energy and cause the star to collapse. But in this case the star still has plenty of fuel and blows up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The core is still composed of explosive oxygen,'' explained another of the paper's authors, J. Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas. ''The oxygen ignites and blows the star to smithereens with no remnant, no black hole left.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''pair instability,'' as it is known, is particularly convenient for the very first stars, made of pristine hydrogen and helium fresh from the furnace of the Big Bang. The resulting explosion scatters all the star's ashes -- the newly made elements like iron and carbon important for life -- outward into space where they can be made into new stars instead of down a black hole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It effectively fertilizes the material from which the second and third generation was made,'' Dr. Filippenko said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN anticipation of commercial space tourism, which has been promised by several companies now busily competing to develop aircraft for suborbital flights as soon as 2009, this may be an appropriate moment to ask, what does one pack for space travel?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could revisit the 1960s cosmonaut fantasy designs of Pierre Cardin and Andre Courreges -- as did so many contemporary designers in their futuristic spring 2007 collections. But Philippe Starck, the French designer who is consulting as art director for Richard Branson's development of Virgin Galactic spacecraft, said that one of his original proposals was for future space explorers to travel naked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole style of the rocket on the inside, the clothes and accessories, I have tried to make the most immaterial as possible,'' said Mr. Starck, describing his vision for interiors that evoke a cloudlike feeling. Material is vulgar, he said. Only the vision of space is important. ''The style is dematerialization,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Starck, 58, has made a career of streamlining functional objects like toothbrushes and watches, as a proponent of a philosophy he described as ''the elegance of the minimum.'' Following the trajectory of ever-shrinking technology design, he reasoned that bulky clothes would be an unnecessary encumbrance to the dream of space travel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of what denuded passengers would look like in zero gravity made him reconsider, so Mr. Starck is now designing pared-down spacesuits -- a rendering shows a plastic-looking bodysuit with attenuated gloves and a dome helmet -- and space luggage with the help of  <span class="companylink">Louis Vuitton.</span> (The luxury goods company built on monogrammed suitcases is opening an exhibition about space travel on Friday in its store on the Champs-Elysees, foreshadowing its journey into astronaut accessories.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this sounds preposterous, consider that Virgin Galactic said it has registered some 200 clients for its first flights, with seats beginning around $200,000. They fit the profile of Vuitton shoppers. But Mr. Starck would only hint at what they are developing: something made of transparent materials, roomy enough for cosmic incidentals so that an astronaut could strap it onto a spacesuit and not look lame.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a new elegance to being upside down, flying like that,'' he said. ''You need everything around you to be in harmony with your body.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no overhead bins on a spacecraft, he explained.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living where we do, it can be hard to tell how ordinary our Sun is, shining dimly in our ordinary galaxy. Then comes something to remind us. This time it is a colossal supernova, called SN 2006gy, the brightest ever recorded. A supernova is an exploding star. This one, first observed last September, lies about 240 million light-years from us in the constellation Perseus. The explosion was perhaps 100 times more powerful than an ordinary supernova, and the star that exploded may have been 150 times the Sun's mass, ''freakishly massive,'' as one astronomer put it. A photograph of SN 2006gy shows that it vastly outshines the entire galaxy in which it is located. This takes some imagining.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so does the nature of the explosion itself, which puzzled observers at first. The usual explanations could not account for a supernova on this scale, nor was this the predictable demise of such a massive star. Instead, this anomalous explosion seems to offer a glimpse into one of the essential conditions for the universe we observe -- the dispersal of heavy elements like carbon and iron. What we are witnessing in SN 2006gy may be the making of the very atomic stuff out of which we ourselves are made. We are used to the notion that looking at the stars means looking back in time. Looking at SN 2006gy may mean looking at one of the fundamental processes in a much earlier universe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers point to an analogous star in our own galaxy, Eta Carinae, about 7,500 light-years away. It is similar in size, and similar in instability, to the star that turned, dying, into SN 2006gy. There is a possibility that Eta Carinae may itself die a similar, extraordinary death. It is perhaps unwise to hope for grand celestial events in one's lifetime. Stunning discoveries from the past should be enough. But it is tempting to wonder what such a nearby supernova, on such a scale, would be like, how it would be to live under such an altered sky.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said that the hail-pocked tank for the next shuttle mission had been repaired and that they expected to be ready for the shuttle Atlantis to blast off by the proposed launching date of June 8. A hailstorm in February left more than 4,000 dings in the foam insulation on the external tank while the shuttle sat on the launching pad. Analysts are confident that pieces of foam big enough to damage the shuttle during ascent -- the problem that doomed the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven astronauts in 2003 -- will not fall off the repaired tank, said N. Wayne Hale, Jr., the shuttle program manager. ''Our goal is zero, and our testing indicates it will be zero,'' Mr. Hale said. JOHN SCHWARTZ   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private pilot was chased by a NASA helicopter after his plane flew near the space shuttle Atlantis as the shuttle sat on its launching pad. The incident prompted an F.B.I. investigation, federal authorities said. The pilot, Michael Dunn, 41, of Port St. Lucie, Fla., became disoriented and drifted into restricted airspace above the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, said Chris Bonner, and F.B.I. special agent. The plane, a 50-year-old Aeronca Champ, lacked a radio or working transponder, Mr. Bonner said. He said the F.B.I. decided not to pursue criminal charges after questioning Mr. Dunn.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hazards of Space Travel: A Tourist's Guide   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Neil F. Comins   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Villard, 253 pages, $19.95 hardcover   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astrophysicist Neil F. Comins sounds confident that the age of space tourism is on the horizon. ''Voyages to Mars, asteroids, comets, and the Jovian system -- Jupiter and the bodies orbiting it -- will all be feasible destinations in the coming half-century,'' he writes. A round trip to any planet this side of Saturn will, ''under ideal conditions,'' take no more than five years of your life. For this starry-eyed prediction to come true, however, he wants us to banish any science-fiction illusions that these trips will be pleasure cruises. His original and sobering book -- part fictional spaceship log, part nuts-and-bolts survival manual -- warns of mundane dangers out there to mind and body far more serious than power-mad Klingons or homicidal computers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, any prolonged flight outside the atmosphere risks exposure of cells to sickening levels of radiation. The skin of a spaceship is not much safer. Space is littered with lithic debris, and a collision with a particle no bigger than a pebble could well be catastrophic. (Pockmarks from thousands of tiny impacts slowed the orbit of the Salyut 7 space station so much that it fell from the sky.) A state of microgravity for years will also take its toll on physical and psychic health. Between 3 and 13 percent of personnel on any space mission are likely to show signs of mental illness from claustrophobia, homesickness, chronic boredom and inactivity. The bacteria that causes tooth decay may grow faster in outer space, where dentists are scarce. Food will taste worse and be harder to digest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landing after years of confinement in a titanium can won't offer much relief either. Landslides and earthquakes will make a simple hike on some surfaces riskier than a trip to the Baghdad airport. ''Walking around on Io will be like exploring a minefield,'' Mr. Comins writes, referring to one of Jupiter's 63 known moons. ''Each step will bring you into contact with life-threatening geological conditions.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His fictional space voyager, Mack Richardson, is less grave (and funnier) about the problems that space tourists will face. He tells us that engineers have still not succeeded in eliminating ''new spaceship smell.'' And given the 10 years he has been away, he has seen his ''two wonderful children'' no more than three times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without ever coming out and saying so, this guide has a timely environmental message for passengers eager to book a suborbital trip on Virgin Galactic's spaceship, scheduled to begin operating in 2010, or any of the joy rides for billionaires. Before rushing off to visit and ''terraform'' other planets, we would be wise to take care of this one. RICHARD B. WOODWARD   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMETS, STARS, THE MOON, AND MARS   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space Poems and Paintings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Written and illustrated by Douglas Florian.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">45 pp. Harcourt. $16. (Ages 5 to 10)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, no one can hear you giggle. Except maybe Douglas Florian.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poet-painter's latest book brings warm wit to the outermost reaches of cold, dark space. Twenty short poems paired with paintings on double-page spreads create an interstellar journey, starting with ''Skywatch,'' an invitation to the pleasures of amateur astronomy. The book travels through our solar system and ends up in the somewhat vaguer territory of comets, black holes and ''the Great Beyond.'' At the end, there's a ''galactic glossary'' and a short bibliography with suggestions for further reading. (Tots demanding ''A Brief History of Time''? Blame this book!)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florian's illustrations depict the marvels of space with luminous texture and detail. Painted in gouache on brown paper bags, they're littered with a secondary text of rubber-stamped words and collaged with scraps of star maps, photographs and other surprises. Die-cut, circular peepholes give glimpses of stars and planets from neighboring pages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most engaging verses in ''Comets, Stars'' serve up planetary facts with a dose of cheeky humor. Take, for example, ''Venus'': ''Scalding-hot surface, / Nine hundred degrees. / Nothing can live there, / No creatures, / No trees. / Poisonous clouds / Of acid above. / Why was it named for / the goddess of love?'' Or ''Pluto,'' a riff on cosmic injustice: ''Pluto was a planet. / But now it doesn't pass. / Pluto was a planet. / They say it's lacking mass. / Pluto was a planet. / Pluto was admired. / Pluto was a planet. / Till one day it got fired.'' Poor Pluto!   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted that these are standout stanzas. Some of Florian's poems stumble on lumpy rhymes or fall flat (see ''The Comet,'' which begins: ''Ice, rock, dirt / Metal and gas -- / Around the sun / A comet may pass.'') Previous books better showcase his lively writing with subjects that are -- quite literally -- alive. His ''Insectlopedia'' and ''Mammalabilia'' offer hilarious observations of animals, while collections like ''Winter Eyes'' find poignancy in the shared seasonal rituals of human beings. Until we find life on Mars, Florian's most enjoyable work will probably stay rooted here, on plain old planet Earth.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 7 -- Hitching a ride on the space shuttle comes to the lucky few only after a long selection process and arduous training. But the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex has worked with current and former astronauts to develop a ride that just may be the next best thing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $60 million Shuttle Launch Experience opened Memorial Day weekend. The 44,000-square-foot building holds four simulators, each of which can accommodate 44 people, taking them through a special effects-heavy approximation of the stages of launching and ascent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production opens with visitors standing for a ''pre-launch briefing'' on video by Brig. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., now retired, who was twice a shuttle commander in his four flights. General Bolden's lively description of the basics is punctuated by powerful bass speakers providing a sensory jolt. Then visitors strap into their seats in the simulator, which looks like an overgrown can that has been loaded into the payload bay of a shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At ''liftoff'' there are more sounds and shaking seats. The entire simulator rears back on hydraulic lifts, setting the passengers up at a nearly 70-degree angle. As the sound and shaking intensifies, air bladders concealed in the seat cushions soften to give the feeling of being pressed back into the seats by the three-G force of ascent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a slight power decrease during ''Max Q,'' the period of maximum stress on the vehicle during ascent, when the shuttle briefly eases off its power and then ramps it up again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a noise and jolt as the solid rocket boosters are blown away from the shuttle, and another when the external tank is released -- and the simulator rocks back toward the floor and points slightly downward to emulate the thrown-into-the-straps feeling that astronauts describe as they first encounter the reduced acceleration and gravity of orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a real flight, that part of the ascent would have taken eight and a half minutes, but for the passengers on the ride, barely five minutes pass. At that point, the payload bay opens, celestial music plays, and the passengers see a projected image of Earth sliding by below.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Richard A. Searfoss, a former shuttle commander, used what he called an ''astronaut-calibrated rear end'' to help the companies that designed and developed the ride. ''I am just amazed how good they've gotten it,'' Colonel Searfoss said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Matthew Eyers, a 12-year-old visiting Florida with his family from Hampshire, England, said he enjoyed the ride -- even if, by some standards, the shuttle is yesterday's news. A few days before, he had ridden the retro-futuristic Space Mountain ride at Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom at  <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is realistic,'' Matthew said with satisfaction. His father, Tim Eyers, put it differently: ''This is more down to earth.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 7 -- Three months after its external fuel tank took thousands of dings and pockmarks from the golf-ball-size hailstones of a freakish winter storm, the space shuttle Atlantis is ready to fly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA plans to launch the first shuttle mission of 2007 from the Kennedy Space Center at 7:38 p.m. Friday. The weather is expected to be very good, with just a 20 percent chance of a delay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pockmarks have been repaired. But at a briefing last month, NASA cautioned reporters not to trust their eyes when they saw the mottled tank. Repaired spots have a creamy color, and the tank will have a speckled appearance until the spots darken over time to the tank's characteristic orange.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your mind will have a hard time convincing your eyes'' that the finished product is smooth and robust enough to take the punishment of launching, said John Chapman, the external tank manager for the space shuttle program. He added, ''It's going to look pretty speckly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been looking a little battered lately as well. The agency has been reeling in recent months from missteps and sheer bad luck, including a fatal shooting by a disgruntled employee at the Johnson Space Center in Houston; the arrest and dismissal of a shuttle astronaut, Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, who faces charges of attempted kidnapping over a confrontation with a romantic rival; and a furor over comments by the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, that he was not sure climate change ''is a problem we must wrestle with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the shuttle is on the launching pad again, with three more flights on the schedule by the end of the year. The delays have forced the space agency to cram its already tight schedule of flights before the shuttle program ends in 2010; NASA had originally scheduled five flights for this year. The program's remaining flights are devoted to completing the international space station, except for a single flight to service the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA announced Thursday that the date of that mission has been tentatively set for Sept. 10, 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew is led by Col. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marine Corps, a veteran of two previous flights who is serving on this flight as commander. The pilot is Col. Lee Joseph Archambaultof the Air Force. Other members of the crew are James F. Reilly II, Patrick G. Forrester, Steven R. Swanson, John D. Olivas and Clayton C. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was only recently added to the mission and will be traveling on Atlantis to swap places with Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who has been working aboard the space station for six months and whose return has been held up by the numerous shuttle delays. The crew will strap into their seats about 4:15 p.m.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 11-day mission, Atlantis will lug a 17.5-ton truss to the space station and astronauts will put it in place. The solar panels on the truss will be unfurled; a rotating joint that will allow the new arrays to track the sun will be readied and started; and an older set of panels that would block the motion of the new ones will be retracted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the mission's tasks have been done before, and NASA hopes that in three scheduled spacewalks the astronauts will overcome previous crews' problems, like balky bolts and unwieldy solar panels that did not fold back up smoothly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the launching, all eyes will be on that fuel tank. The smallest dents that required repair were sanded smooth. Deeper ones were repaired by carving out the holes and filling them with new foam, and the broad areas with the most hits were sanded down by a half inch or more with the foam reapplied.  <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> engineers created an ingenious new tool for milling the foam toward the pointy tip of the tank; they called it the ''pencil sharpener.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all the repairs are common to tank preparation, but there have never been so many on a single tank. NASA officials said the repairs had been thoroughly tested and were safe, though Mr. Chapman acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that ''you don't know until you fly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if some of the foam rattles off the tank during ascent, NASA officials insist, the pieces will be too small to damage the craft -- much smaller than the 1.67-pound chunk of foam that broke a hole in the wing of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and doomed that craft and its crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said NASA now deals with safety issues far more thoroughly than it did before the Columbia disaster. Dr. Logsdon, who served on the independent board that investigated the loss of Columbia and its crew, said that now, ''The flight-readiness review process is as thorough as it's ever going to be with Mike Griffin in charge.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon added: ''They made an engineering judgment, and that's what we pay them to do. There's some level of risk in everything associated with this vehicle. All you can do is the very best job you can do, and then make a judgment.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 8 -- The shuttle Atlantis thundered off the launching pad into a stunningly clear evening sky on Friday on a mission to continue building the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle blasted off at 7:38 p.m. Eastern time with the rattling roar of more than seven million pounds of thrust and rose on a snaking column of smoke and a flame nearly as bright as the dipping sun. Atlantis had what appeared to be a flawless ascent, though the videos that will show whether insulating foam or other launching debris hit the craft have yet to be examined thoroughly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a mission already delayed three months by a hailstorm that damaged the foam on the shuttle's external tank, the preparations for launching were smooth. Weather concerns and technical glitches that often cause last-minute delays were nowhere to be found, and the launching unfolded with clockwork efficiency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before the liftoff, however, it appeared that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration might cancel because of poor weather over the emergency landing sites in Spain and France. These sites, known as Transatlantic Abort Landing sites or TAL, are needed if problems with the engines during an ascent require the shuttle to return to earth without reaching orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 minutes before launching time, the fog that obscured the Istres strip in France cleared enough to allow the launching to go forward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before the liftoff, Michael Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, told the commander, Col. Frederick W. Sturckow, using his nickname, ''O.K., C. J., it took us a little while to get to this point, but the ship's in great shape, so good luck and godspeed. We'll see you back here in about 12 days or so.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Sturckow radioed back with thanks to those who had made the launching possible and added, ''See you in a couple of weeks.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis is carrying a 17.5-ton truss to the station on this 11-day mission. The truss will be added to the starboard side of the $100 billion orbiting laboratory, and will provide power through its new solar arrays.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission requires the astronauts to work through tasks that have, for the most part, been done on previous missions on the station's port side. They will attach the new truss to the structure of the station and remove restraining bolts that hold a rotating joint in place. Once freed, the joint will allow the solar arrays to rotate and track the sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new solar arrays will be unfurled, and an old solar array on top of the station that provided power early in the life of the station will be refolded to its compact shape, otherwise the old array would interfere with the movement of the new arrays. The folded-up array will be moved later to the main solar array truss and extended again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew, led by Colonel Sturckow of the Marine Corps, includes the pilot, Col. Lee Joseph Archambault of the Air Force; James F. Reilly II; Patrick G. Forrester; Steven R. Swanson; John D. Olivas, and Clayton C. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was added to the team in April and will be traveling on Atlantis to take the place of Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who is ending a six-month stay aboard the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hailstorm, which occurred on Feb. 26, pocked the shuttle's external fuel tank with thousands of dents to its delicate foam. NASA rolled the craft back to its hangar, the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building, to have the smaller dents smoothed and the large ones sanded out and refilled with new foam. NASA scrambled to deal with more damage to a single tank than the agency had ever faced, but officials noted that almost all of the repair methods had been a part of working with tanks since the beginning of the program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview on Friday, Michael D. Griffin, NASA's administrator, said that the tank, which was left with a decidedly speckled appearance after the storm and repairs, ''looks great.'' Mr. Griffin said he had no worries that the mended tank would shed foam, the cause of the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour after the launching, the smoke from the solid rocket boosters hung in wild loops above the cape, luminous in the dusky sky.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in a briefing for reporters, NASA officials exulted. The external tank ''has performed in a magnificent manner,'' said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some debris was spotted about the time the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned, Mr. Hale said that this had occurred after the point when foam debris is a threat to the craft. He joked that he turned to John Chapman, the external tank project manager, and said, ''Give me more speckled tanks.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Frederick W. Sturckow, of the U.S. Marine Corps, goes by Rick or ''CJ,'' and was shuttle pilot on flights in 1998 and 2001. ''When I get back, all I can think about,'' he said, is '' when can I go do that again?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's training program is so extensive, he said, that he has told his crew that when they actually fly their mission, ''it's going to feel like we're in the simulator at the Johnson Space Center,'' he said. Using the abbreviation for simulation, he added, ''It's going to feel like we're going from one sim to the next for 12 days.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is 45 years old and calls Lakeside, Calif. his home town. As a young man, he said, he raced stock cars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that the risks of space flight are ''part of my job,'' but that he trusts the agency to make good decisions about safety and to make sure that concerns about safety are heard. He is not inured to risk, however; has two young children, and in an interview earlier this year said that when he saw his 4-year-old jumping off of an 8-foot-high stack of hay bales, ''it scared me to death.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Lee Joseph Archambault of the Air Force will serve as pilot on his first mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His inspiration for becoming an astronaut, he said, was Eugene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon and a native of a town close to his hometown of Bellwood, Ill. ''He was definitely the hometown hero of the people in the community that I grew up in,'' he recalled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Archambault, who is 46, joined the astronaut Corps in 1998, along with crew mates Steve Swanson and Danny Olivas, and they have all been waiting since then for a flight. But, he said, he's not complaining. ''You get here, you're happy to be here, you wait in line, you keep doing a good job -- and eventually good things will come,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A a pilot who loves high-performing aircraft in the Air Force, he said the moment he was waiting for is ''when the solid rocket boosters light and you have seven million pounds of thrust pushing you away from earth into space.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His nickname, going back to his Air Force days, is ''Bru.'' The name is an abbreviation for ''bomb rack unit,'' a part of an F-111 that he and his crew partner accidentally jettisoned ''through an unfortunate series of switch-throws.'' The unit landed harmlessly in a bombing range, but the nickname stuck. '' As my commander made it very clear to me, to have lost a $7,806 piece of equipment'' was not a good thing, he said with a laugh. ''In hindsight, it turned out to be nothing but a little bit of an embarrassing experience for me,'' he said, and '' it was a good lesson'' he carries to this day. ''In the space shuttle, there's plenty of opportunity to back up your crewmates in everything they're doing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James F. Reilly II is 53 years old and grew up in Mesquite, Tex. He has a Ph.D. in geosciences, and is coming back to the station six years after his first visit. This is his third mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, he said people have often asked him to describe the best thing about flying in space after having flown the first time. After long thought, he said he has an answer: ''It's not so much what you see and what you feel and what you do, it's who you fly with. You know, you get up there and you're with these people and you're doing this incredible work and going through what is a phenomenal experience, and you just get to know these people really well.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that the number of opportunities to fly will dwindle was the program nears its end. ''At some point you realize that this one might be your last flight, which this one may be my last, just doing the math of the people that are in the pipeline and when we stop flying the shuttle,'' he said. ''This one may very well be my last flight.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Patrick G. Forrester is retired from the Army and is 50. He was born in El Paso, Tex., and he and his wife have two children. He is a seasoned spacewalker, and is training his fellow spacewalkers to be ready on this mission for the fact that the training they get in the enormous swimming pool at the Johnson Space Center does not fully recreate the state of weightlessness, and that it's important to get acclimated to the quirks of weightless living.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in space, although things weigh nothing, they still have mass, he explained in an interview -- and mass, he said, can be tricky. ''Although gravity doesn't have an impact on it as far as wanting to pull it down toward the Earth, that it still has mass related to its velocity. So that once you get something moving, that it takes almost as much effort to get it to stop moving.'' He flew with Commander Sturckow in 2001, and ''I was the only one on the crew that had not flown in space before.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Sturckow, he said, ''grabbed me and pulled me aside and he said, 'I want you to know that even though you've never flown, that I will never treat you like a rookie.' '' That supportive attitude, he said ''really endeared me to him.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA makes demands on the lives of its astronauts, he said. ''Even if you're not training for a mission, there are a lot of demands and requirements on the astronauts' schedule.'' He addd, however, that ''it is all worth it -- and it is no different than what I experienced in the military. And my family is very much behind this,'' he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John D. Olivas, who goes by Danny, grew up in El Paso, Tex. He and his wife have five children. In an interview, he said that many of the skills for the mission have come from before his time at NASA, ''when I worked for  <span class="companylink">Dow Chemical</span> in Freeport, Texas'' and did maintenance on the production plants.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Doing that kind of work taught me a lot about, I think, what I see, parallels in the kind of spacewalks and the things that we're supposed to do in spacewalks,'' he said. ''I use everything, all the tools that I've accumulated through my life,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and materials science from Rice University, and has six patents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency, like any organization that works with high risks, can get complacent if things get too comfortable, he said. ''And then the things that you never thought would bite you end up biting you.'' He added, however, that ''we are very sensitive to that fact here at NASA,'' and besides, ''if you're worried about everything all the time, you would never go out.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven R. Mr. Swanson, who is 46, was born in Syracuse, N.Y., but considers Steamboat Springs, Colo. to be his hometown. He and his wife, the former Mary Drake Young, have three children. He has a doctorate in computer science from Texas A &amp; M University, and worked for NASA in support of the space program for 10 years before being selected as an astronaut in 1998. His crew nickname is ''Swanny.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his children -- the oldest is in his 20s, and the youngest is 11 -- are all well aware that flying in space can be hazardous. ''You just tell them the truth,'' he said. ''You tell them in life, there are some things you do that have risks, and it's something you live with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the other astronauts, he is taking a small number of personal items aboard the shuttle including a wedding ring and, for his youngest, a Lego astronaut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clayton C. Anderson will be joining the crew of the International Space Station, taking the place of Commander Sunita Willliams of the Navy, who will be returning to Earth after six months on orbit. He is 48 years old, and comes from Ashland, Neb. He is married to the former Susan Jane Harreld; they have two children. He earned master of science degree in Aerospace Engineering from Iowa State University in 1983. He was only added to the shuttle crew recently, when NASA officials decided to bring Commander Williams back on this delayed flight instead of the later flight that had been originally planned. He said in an interview on the NASA Web site that he was inspired by the space program when his parents woke him and his brother and sister up in the middle of the night to watch television coverage of the first astronauts to go around the moon on the Apollo 8 mission. He said his mother believes that his path toward becoming an astronaut was set early on. ''She says I was ready to be an astronaut at age 4 when she dressed me up in tinfoil and I got second place in the local parade during July.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She said I was robbed -- I should've gotten first.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALLING all astronauts! To Waterbury?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's where Paul Largay, the president of Largay Travel, which specializes in adventure vacations, is selling seats on Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, scheduled to begin suborbital flights from the Mojave Desert to the fringe of space in late 2009.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Largay, 49, is one of 65 agents worldwide and the only one in the state authorized by London-based Virgin Galactic, a division of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Airways, to sell seats on the spacecraft. Mr. Largay was selected from an initial group of about 250 luxury travel agents after a long application process and a series of interviews with the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Largay, who lives in Woodbury, said he normally sells vacations like hot air balloon trips above the Alps and safaris to Africa for $20,000 to $300,000 to customers as far away as Europe, South America and the Cayman Islands. He said he underwent two days of training at Cape Canaveral in Florida before he began selling the space flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was mostly about how to address people's concerns and about the technology that is being used,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carolyn Wincer, the head of astronaut sales for Virgin Galactic, said Mr. Largay was chosen because of his experience, track record and client base.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we also really wanted were agents that were passionate about getting commercial space travel off the ground and making it a viable industry, and wanted to get in on the ground floor,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wincer said that since February, almost 200 people from 20 countries had agreed to pay $200,000 to be guaranteed a seat on one of the first flights on SpaceShipTwo, which will take six people at a time 70 miles above the Earth to the edge of space and back in roughly two hours.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that during the flight, passengers would be able to leave their seats and experience weightlessness, and their view will span 800 miles in any direction and include the curvature of the Earth and the blackness of space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be a real space flight,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Largay said he had four potential customers for the flight (a husband and wife and two men), none of whom wished to be identified. He said one was from Connecticut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides wealth, Mr. Largay said the four share one trait. ''They each just have a real sense of adventure,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Patterson, 55, a financier from Bronxville who bought his seat directly through Virgin Galactic, said that being one of the first civilians to fly into space was what attracted him.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be in the first 10,000 people is not nearly as exciting as being in the first 100 or so,'' he said. ''It's a tiny little community that is going to get to say they did this.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That exclusivity, Mr. Largay said, is what makes the trip so attractive to those with the desire and the money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've said to some of my clients that are interested: 'I can warranty you this: that you will never go to a cocktail party after you've taken this flight and have someone say ''checkmate'' to you.' ''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew of the International Space Station welcomed the seven astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis aboard on Sunday, the third day of the shuttle's mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before docking, the shuttle commander, Col. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marines, guided the spaceship through a graceful back flip over South America that allowed station astronauts to photograph the ship's belly to detect damage from launching debris. So far, the only area of concern is a pulled-up corner of an insulating blanket covering one of the ship's maneuvering rocket pods, leaving a four-inch-by-six-inch area exposed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a briefing for reporters, John Shannon, the chairman of the mission management team, said the team was discussing a spacewalk to correct the problem -- possibly by simply tucking the blanket back into place -- or leaving it alone, since the upper side of the shuttle suffers far less heat during the return to Earth than the underside.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for the Goldilocks planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers and ordinary people alike were cheered at the discovery in April of a new planet only five times the mass of the Earth circling a dim star in Libra. The planet, known as Gliese 581c, orbits at a distance of about seven million miles, within the star's so-called habitable zone where it is neither too hot nor too cold for water to exist on its surface, making it the most promising spot for life yet found outside the solar system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the treasure map of the universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X,'' said one member of the discovery team, Xavier Delfosse of Grenoble University in France.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody got excited,'' said Manfred Cuntz, an astronomer at the University of Texas at Arlington.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, it seems that Gliese 581c is no paradise. A new analysis by German and Texas astronomers assuming Earthlike characteristics for its geology and atmosphere has concluded that the planet is probably a stifling greenhouse unsuitable for Life As We Know It.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just too hot,'' said Dr. Cuntz, who was part of a team of theorists led by Werner von Bloh of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Germany. He added, ''I would not recommend mankind to move to that planet right now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a strange twist, however, the astronomers said that another planet in the system, heavier at eight times the mass of Earth and farther from its star, had emerged from the calculations as possibly a pleasant abode, the new Goldilocks perhaps. The planet, known as Gliese 581d, orbits at a distance of 23 million miles, which would normally make it too cold for liquid water, but the same greenhouse effect that would torch the smaller closer planet would warm the larger outer one and make it livable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We cannot cool down an atmosphere of a planet,'' Dr. Cuntz explained, ''but we can heat it up.'' In a paper that has been submitted to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, he and his colleagues went so far as to write about the outer planet, Gliese 581d, ''Despite the adverse conditions of this planet, at least some primitive forms of life may be able to exist on its surface.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other astronomers, while agreeing that there was an emerging consensus that 581c was too hot for life, described the new paper as speculative, resting on assumptions about how closely the Gliese planets resembled the Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main lesson, said Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is that the idea of habitability is much more complicated than just the locations of planetary orbits. ''The properties of the planet come into play,'' Dr. Seager said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Astronomers are going to realize just how complicated the idea of habitability is,'' she said. ''The whole of astronomy is built on not knowing anything.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Goldilocks planet was discovered by a group led by Stephane Udry, of the Geneva Observatory, who said their initial estimates of its temperature and habitability had been based on its having only a thin atmosphere. He agreed that a thicker atmosphere would heat it up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar D. Sasselov, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who has also been studying the Gliese system, agreed that it was reasonable to expect that the greenhouse effect would warm the outer planet to comfortable temperatures. ''I would trust that result because I am getting the same numbers,'' he said in an e-mail message from Greece.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as Dr. Seager emphasized, it remains to be seen which models of earthly geology and climate can be safely and appropriately extrapolated to the much more massive Gliese planets. All astronomers really know now about these planets are their masses and orbits. Another complication is that the planets are so close to their star that they are almost certainly tidally locked, with the same side always facing the star, leading to constant heating on one side and cooling on the other. The resulting extreme weather, Dr. Cuntz said, made it likely that only simple forms of life could exist on Gliese 581d, the outer planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are not likely to know more about these planets until space missions like NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finders and the European Space Agency's Darwin, designed to study terrestrial planets in the realms beyond our solar system, are in operation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Cuntz said, ''We really have to do more work.'' The Gliese planets, he said, are still the closest analogues to the Earth that have been found. ''This is really to the credit of the Swiss group,'' he said. ''These two planets are really the best two cases we have.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers said Monday night that they would extend the mission of the space shuttle Atlantis for a spacewalk to repair a problem that could cause heating damage during re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement came during a briefing for reporters as astronauts James F. Reilly II and John D. Olivas were wrapping up a complex spacewalk of more than six hours.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two men connected the power lines to a new structural truss and solar arrays on the starboard side of the International Space Station. The shuttle brought the 17.5-ton truss up in its payload bay, and the shuttle pilot, Col. Lee Joseph Archambault of the Air Force, connected the truss to the station using the station's robot arm before the spacewalkers stepped outside to do their electrical work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, the first of this mission, was delayed by about an hour because of problems with the gyroscopes that keep the station's attitude stable on orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extending the mission to 13 days from 11 is likely to involve adding a fourth spacewalk to reseat an insulating blanket that pulled away from the maneuvering rocket pod cover during ascent. Blankets are used on the top of the shuttle instead of the more heat-resistant tiles that cover the bottom of the craft because the heat during re-entry is much higher on the bottom of the shuttle than on the top.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the blanket pulled up because of wind forces and not because of any impact with launch debris. It exposed a 4-inch-by-6-inch area of the graphite epoxy honeycomb underneath.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, NASA experts all but dismissed the pulled-up blanket as a minor problem best addressed by leaving the blanket alone. Many shuttles have returned to Earth with more serious damage to the same area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But John Shannon, the chairman of the mission management team, said Monday night that the analysis led his team to take a cautious approach.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The honeycomb, Mr. Shannon said, degrades at a lower temperature than the 1,000 degrees that can be expected during the 15-minute period of peak heating during entry. ''How long it would take to completely erode is very questionable; no one could give me that answer,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So the right answer here, the better part of valor, was to go and put it down and secure it,'' Mr. Shannon said. Analysts are still trying to determine the best way to fix the problem, he said, but it might come down to something as simple as folding the blanket back into place.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ   </div><div>441 words</div><div>13 June 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts and mission managers scrambled yesterday when a fire alarm went off on the Russian part of the International Space Station. Within 20 minutes, however, the problem was determined to be a software glitch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After alarms clanged in the background and a Russian interpreter seemed to grow breathless trying to keep up with the stream of discussion on the alarm and the response, Clayton C. Anderson, an astronaut on the space station, called down to mission control and said, ''We looked around and smelled around,'' and found no evidence of fire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a briefing for reporters from Houston, mission managers said the alarm was set off by a problem with Russian computers that work with American ones to control the navigation and functions of the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Russian computers failed, control of the attitude of the station was transferred to small maneuvering jets on the space shuttle Atlantis. But in that mode of control, the station's solar panels rest in a poor position for gathering sunlight, so power levels dipped and mission control had to order some inessential equipment be turned off until attitude control could be turned back over to the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The false alarm added a touch of excitement to the fifth day of a space shuttle mission. On Tuesday, the station's two newest solar arrays were extended to their full 140-foot length, rippling and golden as the central mast pulled the fan-folded array out of its packing crate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panels will provide some 20,000 watts of power for the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, the chairman of the mission management team, said his group was still studying how to repair a heat shield on one of the large maneuvering rocket pods of the shuttle that had pulled up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon also said a pressure sensor on the shuttle's wing leading edge had detected a jolt that analysts were looking into, but he added that since other sensors did not give off a similar signal, ''we don't feel there's an impact, just a little click.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, astronauts will work from inside the station to retract a solar array that sits on top of the station. Once folded, the old array will eventually be moved to the side of the station. But the arrays have proved balky in the past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael T. Suffredini, the program manager for the space station, said NASA had developed techniques to encourage the arrays to fold. If the array is stubborn, Mr. Suffredini said, spacewalking astronauts will be ready to coax it to retract.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian computers that help keep the International Space Station in orbit were out of commission for the second day, a glitch that could imperil the $100 billion orbiting laboratory if it is not corrected.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials expressed confidence, however, that the problem could be resolved. ''I fully expect us to be able to do this,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, the manager of the station program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station depends on Russian and American computer systems to maintain the attitude of the station as it orbits the earth. The United States computer system runs the network of gyroscopes that provide stability, and the Russian system controls thrusters that correct the orientation of the station when the gyroscopes alone cannot do the job and shift position for operations like docking and avoiding debris.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem first emerged on Tuesday as astronauts were connecting a new 17.2-ton truss to the station. The three navigation computers in the Russian section crashed and could not be rebooted. Thruster control was passed to the shuttle Atlantis, which has enough fuel to provide the attitude adjustment service for several days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's not an urgent situation,'' Mr. Suffredini said. ''But clearly we need to get this resolved before the shuttle leaves.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Russians and Americans were trying to figure out whether the problem was related to the added mass of the new truss, the additional power from the new panels or some other issue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the problem is not corrected, the station could be unable to maintain the best position for charging its solar arrays when the gyroscopes become overloaded and at worst could cause it to tumble from orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the astronauts Patrick G. Forrester, a retired Air Force colonel, and Steven R. Swanson, spent more than seven hours outside the station as spacewalking handymen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They worked to free a rotating joint that will allow the station's new solar arrays to track the sun. The astronauts removed all but one of the locks that had been placed on the mechanism to secure it for its trip to the station, leaving the last one until issues with one of the joint's two drive locks -- which apparently were miswired -- could be resolved.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said yesterday that they fully expected engineers to resolve an unprecedented failure of computers on the International Space Station, though they cautioned that the process could take days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't get up tomorrow and expect it all to be working,'' the space station program manager, Michael T. Suffredini, said at an evening briefing for reporters, but he added, ''I feel like we're making good progress to resolving this issue.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to return to Earth next week. The mission has already been extended by two days for a fourth spacewalk, and may be extended further to deal with the computer issue, officials said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computers, which are Russian, began crashing on Tuesday as astronauts were connecting a new truss and solar arrays to the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a two-pronged system for maintaining the orientation of the station as it circles Earth, the American component runs gyroscopes that provide stability, and the Russian system controls thrusters that take over when the gyroscopes are overwhelmed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the problem is not corrected, the station could be unable to maintain the best position for charging its solar arrays. In the worst case, NASA and the Russian space agency would have to evacuate it.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian astronauts and engineers may have corrected a problem yesterday that caused computers aboard the International Space Station to crash and raised the possibility that the station might have to be evacuated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a feat of ingenuity and high-stakes electronic jury-rigging, the astronauts isolated a switch that appeared to be the source of repeated crashes since Tuesday and had the balky computers start up again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They successfully bypassed a power switch with an external cable,'' said Brandi Dean, a spokeswoman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sets of computers control critical systems in the station, including the thrusters that help orient the station on orbit. Each system has three redundant channels, or ''lanes,'' so that if one crashes, two remain to perform in its place.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just one of the three redundant lanes needs to be functioning at any time. On Tuesday, all six crashed and could not be restarted without going back into a cycle of crashes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having gotten two of each kind of computer back online, the Russians then shut them down, Ms. Dean said, ''so they could properly secure the jumper cables and close the equipment panels.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They then brought up the computers again and two lanes on each system came back. The engineers kept them running idly without taking over functions like attitude control or running the oxygen generator.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So engineers planned to wait until the next set of passes, in the wee hours this morning, to bring the computers back up and to analyze the stream of data that they produce to ensure that things are going smoothly before giving the computers the additional work load of running the systems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unclear that the repair would hold, and spacewalking astronauts performed more work outside the station yesterday to isolate the computers from connections with newly deployed solar panels that may have set off the problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood of NASA officials was decidedly more upbeat toward the end of the day than at the beginning, when overnight efforts to repair the glitch proved unsuccessful.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a midday news briefing. Michael T. Suffredini, the head of the space station program, insisted that even if the problem was not resolved quickly, the astronauts were in no danger and that nothing had emerged that would require an evacuation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not remotely concerned right now that we're looking at a scenario like that,'' Mr. Suffredini said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He explained that the station could still support its crew despite the computer problems, adding, ''From a life support perspective, we're in good shape,'' with sufficient oxygen and temperature and humidity controls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is nobody in this agency -- and, as far as I know, in the Russian agency -- that believes this vehicle is at risk of being lost,'' Mr. Suffredini said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an evening briefing, he struck an upbeat tone. When the Russian computers came up that afternoon, he said, ''it was an indication that things had changed,and changed for the better.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Russians struggled to correct the computer problems, two American astronauts, James F. Reilly II and John D. Olivas, conducted the planned spacewalk that might otherwise have been the most compelling moment of the mission. Mr. Olivas first rode out on the robotic arm to fold down a bit of the heat shield that had folded on ascent, exposing a four-by-six-inch area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Live video from Dr. Olivas's helmet camera showed him joining the errant insulating blanket to its neighbor with surgical staples from the medical kit on the station and then gingerly inserting a line of 21 stainless steel pins to bind the blanket to an adjoining set of thermal tiles, a task that requires dexterity that was clearly hard to achieve using the bulky gloves of a spacesuit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Dr. Reilly swapped a water-discharge vent on the station's Destiny module with a hydrogen vent that will be part of a new oxygen generation system on the station. The replacement went smoothly, but replacing a protective cover over the vent proved difficult, and that task was put aside.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With both tasks completed, the astronauts moved on to help fold a solar array back into its packing box. The array, which sits on top of the station and provided the first solar power to the complex, sat in the way of arrays that have been installed on the sides of the station. It will eventually be moved to the side of the station and redeployed. Having the fanfold array resume its more compact shape has required shaking, poking and pulling with tools created or modified for the task, a process that NASA calls ''fluffing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One more spacewalk is planned for tomorrow, consisting largely of what NASA calls ''get ahead'' tasks to prepare the station for the next stages of construction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''Repairs and Glitches''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spacewalking astronauts repaired a thermal blanket near the tail of the shuttle Atlantis, and cosmonauts began to get control computers that had crashed up and running in the Russian service module.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, June 16 -- Mission managers on Saturday cleared the space shuttle Atlantis to land next week after concluding that its heat shield was safe enough to withstand re-entering Earth's atmosphere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clearance came a day after John D. Olivas, during a spacewalk, stapled down a loose thermal blanket that covered an engine pod near the shuttle's tail. The blanket peeled back during the June 8 launching from the Kennedy Space Center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been sensitive about the shuttles' heat shields since the Columbia accident killed seven astronauts in 2003. A piece of foam from the external tank came loose during the launching, striking Columbia's wing and allowing fiery gases to penetrate it on re-entry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis astronauts plan another inspection of the heat shield after the shuttle undocks from the International Space Station, which is scheduled for Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers may extend the shuttle's stay at the station by a day to allow more time for engineers to figure out why a computer system on the Russian side of the station crashed. The computers control the station's oxygen supply and maintain its position in orbit.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian computers on the International Space Station passed a crucial test yesterday and are back in operation following a weeklong glitch that might have led to the station's evacuation had it not been fixed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the space station's computers working again, the six-man crew of the space shuttle Atlantis packed up and prepared to go home. Also returning to Earth will be Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, who is concluding a six-month stay on the space station and set the record for the longest spaceflight by a woman. Clayton C. Anderson, who flew up on Atlantis, is remaining at the station as Commander Williams's replacement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have everything working as it's supposed to,'' Philip L. Engelauf, a member of mission operations, said at a news conference yesterday evening. ''We're in good shape as we get ready to undock.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian computers started crashing last Tuesday soon after the installation of a 17.2-ton truss. The computers control environmental systems in the Russian parts of the station, an oxygen generator and, most crucially, thrusters that help maintain the station's orientation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gyroscopes can make small adjustments, but larger shifts require the thrusters. For the past week, the station has been relying on the thrusters of the docked Atlantis for any needed nudges. Had the computer problems not been fixed before Atlantis's departure, the station's crew of three might also have had to leave.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the weekend, Russian astronauts pinpointed the problem to balky power circuitry that acts as surge protectors for the computers and bypassed the circuit. All the computers then started up and appear to be working normally, but engineers are still investigating.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still haven't found what I think folks would call a smoking gun that could identify exactly what caused the initial problem,'' Mr. Engelauf said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yesterday's test, the computers and thrusters resumed responsibility for the station's orientation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers then gave the go-ahead for Atlantis's astronauts to leave. The hatches between the Atlantis and the space station were closed yesterday evening in preparation for undocking today. The Atlantis is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the glitch, the shuttle astronauts accomplished more construction tasks than had been planned. The astronauts also folded back and stapled down part of the shuttle's insulating blanket that had come loose during liftoff.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The damage was not considered a safety threat, but mission managers believed the heat of re-entry might cause damage to the underlying structure that would require lengthy repairs.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Atlantis undocked from the International Space Station. After backing away about 450 feet, the Atlantis flew around the space station, taking pictures of the station's new configuration, including a 17.2-ton truss installed during the shuttle astronauts' nine-day visit. Later, the astronauts used a camera attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to perform a final check for damage to the nose cone and the leading edges of the wings. The astronauts will test the orbiter's flight systems today in preparation for a scheduled landing tomorrow at Cape Canaveral, Fla., weather permitting; otherwise, the shuttle will remain in orbit another day.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON Thursday, on the summer solstice, the Sun will celebrate the year's lazy months by resting on the horizon. The word solstice derives from the Latin ''sol'' (sun) and ''sistere'' (to stand still). The day marks the sun's highest point in the sky, the moment when our shadows shrink to their shortest length of the year. How strange to think that these mundane friends, our ever-present familiars, can actually go faster than the sun's rays.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remarked on this recently to my husband as we sat on the porch with our shadows pooling by our chairs. Nothing can go faster than light, he insisted, expressing what is surely the most widely known law of physics, ingrained into us by a thousand ''Nova'' programs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the point, I explained: Nothing can go faster than light. A shadow isn't a thing. It's a non-thing. It's the absence of light.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Special relativity dictates that we cannot move anything more quickly than the particles of light known as photons, but no law says you can't do nothing faster than light. Physicists have known this for a long time, even if they generally do not mention it on PBS documentaries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband looked troubled, as did my sister and some friends I regaled with the story that evening. Like the warp drive on ''Star Trek,'' faster-than-light travel is supposed to be a science-fiction fantasy. Isn't it?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are right about the travel: According to relativity, no physical substance can exceed the speed of light because it would take infinite energy to accelerate anything to such a velocity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the laws of physics pertain only to that which is. That which isn't is not bound by relativity's restraint. From the point of view of relativity, a shadow (having no mass) is a non-thing, an existential void.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's quite easy to conjure up a faster-than-light shadow, at least in theory. Build a great klieg light, a superstrong version of the ones set up at the Academy Awards. Now paste a piece of black paper onto the klieg's glass so there is a shadow in the middle of the beam, like the signal used to summon Batman. And we are going to mount our light in space and broadcast the Bat-call to the cosmos.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to our trick is to rotate the klieg. As the light turns, the bat shadow sweeps across the sky. Round and round it goes, projecting into the void. Just as the rim of a bicycle wheel moves faster than its hub, so too, away from the source our bat shadow will fly faster and faster, a consequence of the geometry that guarantees the rim of a really big wheel moves faster than a co-rotating small wheel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a great enough distance from the source, our shadow bat will go so fast it will exceed the speed of light. This does not violate relativity because a shadow carries no energy. Literally nothing is transferred. Our shadow bat can go 10 times the speed of light or 100 times faster without breaking any of physics' sacred rules.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My sister leapt to the heart of this apparent paradox: Why isn't the light itself traveling faster than the speed of light? Isn't it also rotating in space? Actually, no. The bulbs that produce the light are spinning, but the light particles leave the source at 186,000 miles a second, the vaunted ''speed of light.'' Once emitted, the photons continue to travel at this speed directly away from the source. Only the shadow revolves around the great circle. The critical point is that no object, no substance, defies light.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband was right to object that you'd need one spectacular klieg to produce a detectable shadow thousands of miles out in space. Still, the theory is sound.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anthropologist Mary Douglas noted that all systems of categorizing break down somewhere, unable to incorporate certain forms. By standing beyond relativity's injunction, shadows suggest the limits of all classification schemes, a tension that even modern science cannot completely resolve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the terms recognized by relativity, shadows are non-things. Yet before the invention of clocks, shadows were the most important means for telling time. Weightless and without energy, shadows can nonetheless convey information -- though they cannot, despite our giant klieg, be used for faster-than-light communication. That's because the shadow's location cannot be detected until the light, moving at its ponderous relativistic pace, arrives.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here there be monsters,'' said the medieval maps, signaling the limits of reason's reach. As a map of being, physics is flanked by the monsters of non-being whose outlines we glimpse in the paradoxes of quantum mechanics and in the zooming arc of a shadow bat going faster than light.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Christian theology we are told, ''God is that which nothing is greater than.'' The scientific corollary might be, ''Light is that which nothing is faster than'' -- a statement true both in spirit and fact.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis's heat shield is safe to return to Earth, mission managers decided, a day before the space shuttle was scheduled to land in Florida. A forecast for thunderstorms appeared to be the main obstacle for its return. Thunderstorms were forecast to be within 34 miles of the landing strip at Kennedy Space Center for the shuttle's first landing opportunity today at 1:55 p.m. Eastern time, with clouds within 8,000 feet, both violations of flight rules.   </p>
