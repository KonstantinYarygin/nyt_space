<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty years ago today, the Soviet Union launched a small sphere into space that could do little more than beep-beep-beep as it circled the Earth. Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite ever placed in orbit and a stunning propaganda achievement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sputnik brought home that the Russians weren't quite the backward oafs Americans had thought. They had a satellite that could look down on our homeland and -- far more scary -- a powerful rocket that could presumably carry a nuclear warhead over our borders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to exaggerate the impact the first Sputnik had on an America enmeshed in the cold war. Sputnik has been likened to Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- events provoking a national response to new dangers. But its legacy has been mixed, and its lessons for today seem limited.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States, previously smitten with long-range bombers, rushed to develop intercontinental missiles and defenses against them. It created a new civilian space agency and an advanced research agency for the military. It bolstered science, engineering and mathematics education at all levels. In 1961, still trailing Russian space accomplishments, the United States declared an all-out race to the moon, culminating in a landing in 1969. Without Sputnik, the moon landing would not have occurred so quickly and might still be a distant goal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sputnik spurred the development of spy satellites that helped calm unrealistic fears of a missile or bomber gap. And by stimulating a rapid expansion of space activities, it deserves some credit for speeding the development of communications, navigation and weather satellites. Some of its other contributions were not so durable. After six landings on the moon, the manned space program retreated into low-Earth orbit for 35 years. The advanced science and math curricula developed for schools fell out of use. And we are again bemoaning a paucity of science and engineering graduates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there are wistful calls for another Sputnik-like event to goad a re-invigoration of American education and technology. Some hope that China's emerging space program will serve as a catalyst, but it is hard to believe that much fear or awe will be generated if China retraces the steps we took decades ago. Future space exploration, involving extremely costly missions to Mars and the asteroids, will likely require close cooperation with other nations, not fearful reaction against their achievements.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 -- The NASA spacecraft on the way to Pluto has discovered lightning in the polar regions of Jupiter, scientists said Tuesday. It also found that the volcanically active moon Io belches out tons of material that travels hundreds of millions of miles down Jupiter's long magnetic tail.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, New Horizons, was launched in January 2006 and made a close pass to Jupiter on Feb. 28 of this year to get a slingshot-like gravity boost designed to cut three years off its trip to Pluto, which it is to reach in July 2015.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons scientists took advantage of the trip around Jupiter to test the craft's seven scientific instruments and operational procedures in a trial run for Pluto, and said the exercise produced 700 separate observations that resulted in fundamental new discoveries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we found blew a lot of people away,'' said Dr. S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for the mission and head of the Science Directorate of NASA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides confirming and amplifying findings from seven previous spacecraft that have visited Jupiter, it produced unexpected knowledge about the planet's environment, Dr. Stern said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a great set of instruments and showed up at the right time to make some fascinating observations,'' Dr. Stern said in an interview. ''The results add tremendously to our understanding of Jupiter and its moons, rings and magnetosphere.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons team last spring presented early results from the encounter, but revealed more-detailed analyses of its data on Tuesday at a meeting in Orlando, Fla., of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. The results will be detailed in the Oct. 12 issue of the journal Science.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter has lightning strikes near both poles, the team found, a phenomenon previously observed only on Earth. Six flashes in the north polar region and seven in the south suggest that the planet circulates and radiates its heat uniformly through water clouds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons made the first close observations of the Little Red Spot, a swirling storm 70 percent as large as Earth that appeared several years ago. The storm, in the planet's atmosphere, is half as large as the centuries-old Great Red Spot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the moon Io, the closest to Jupiter, the spacecraft spotted 11 volcanic plumes, three of which were seen for the first time, the team said. One was a 200-mile-high eruption rising above the volcano Tvashtar that showed how the ejection became visible as particles in the plume cooled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons's global map of Io confirms the moon's status as the most active body in the solar system, researchers reported, showing more than 20 geological changes since the Galileo Jupiter orbiter provided the last close-up look in 2001.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Departing Jupiter, New Horizons flew down the huge magnetic tail formed by energized solar wind particles affecting the planet's powerful magnetic field. The spacecraft spotted fluxes of charged particles flowing hundreds of millions of miles beyond the planet and evidence that Io's volcanoes produce tons of material that moves down the tail as large, dense blobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project scientists also said the spacecraft captured the clearest images so far of the tenuous ring system around Jupiter. While images showed the tiny inner moons Metis and Adrastea shepherding the materials around the thin rings, a search for smaller moonlets inside the rings, possible new sources of the dusty material they contain, found no bodies wider than a mile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We looked in the rings for parent bodies, but they were not there,'' Dr. Stern said. ''This is how rings work on Saturn, but not Jupiter. This indicates different ring systems around different planets evolve in different ways.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, which lifted off at 9:22 a.m. Eastern time from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, slipped into orbit nine minutes later. The ship is expected to dock with the space station on Friday morning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Peggy A. Whitson, 47, an American astronaut who is a biochemist and who will be the first woman to command the space station, is aboard the craft. She is on her second mission to the outpost. The others are Yuri I. Malenchenko, 45, a Russian astronaut who commanded the station on a previous tour, and Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor, 35, an orthopedic surgeon who is the first Malaysian to go into space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson and Colonel Malenchenko will replace two Russians nearing the end of their six-month tour, Fyodor Yurchikhin, the commander, and Oleg Kotov, the flight engineer. The Russians, along with Dr. Shukor, are to return to Earth on Oct. 21 aboard the Soyuz that brought them to the station in April.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Shukor, whose parents watched his liftoff from the visitors' gallery at Baikonur, is flying to the station as a Russian guest as part of Malaysia's agreement with Russia to buy Russian military jets. He was chosen from among 11,000 applicants to become Malaysia's first astronaut. As a Muslim, he said, he will try to pray and fast in space and be an inspiration to Muslims everywhere.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A caption yesterday with an optical image of the Great Nebula of Andromeda omitted a credit. It was by Robert Gendler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Apr 28 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it a small step for E.T., a leap for radio astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers in Hat Creek, Calif., are planning today to switch on the first elements of a giant new array of radio telescopes that they say will greatly extend the investigation of natural and unnatural phenomena in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Allen Telescope Array, as it is known, is complete, it will consist of 350 antennas, each 20 feet in diameter. Using the separate antennas as if they were one giant dish, radio astronomers will be able to map vast swaths of the sky cheaply and efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array will help search for new phenomena like black holes eating each other and so-called dark galaxies without stars, as well as extend the search for extraterrestrial radio signals a thousandfold, to include a million nearby stars over the next two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, 42 of the antennas, mass-produced from molds and employing inexpensive telecommunications technology, will go into operation. ''It's like cutting the ribbon on the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria,'' said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the Seti Institute, in Mountain View, Calif., who pointed out that this was the first radio telescope ever designed specifically for the extraterrestrial quest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope, named for Paul G. Allen, who provided $25 million in seed money, is a joint project of the Radio Astronomy Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, and the Seti Institute. ''If they do find something, they're going to call me up first and say we have a signal,'' Mr. Allen said in an interview, adding, ''So far the phone hasn't rung.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Describing himself as ''a child of the 50s, the golden age of space exploration and science fiction,'' Mr. Allen, a founder of <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, said he first got interested in supporting the search for extraterrestrial intelligence after a conversation 12 years ago with Carl Sagan, the Cornell astronomer and exuberant proponent of cosmic wonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the idea later arose to build a telescope array on the cheap, using off-the-shelf satellite dish technology and advanced digital signal processing, Mr. Allen was intrigued. ''If you know anything about me,'' he said, ''you know I'm a real enthusiast for new unconventional approaches to things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telescopes, including radio telescopes, have traditionally been custom-built one-of-a-kind items. The antennas for the Allen array are stamped from a mold. Mr. Allen's family foundation put up the money to get the first part of the array built, with other contributions from Nathan Myhrvold, formerly of <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and the chief executive of Intellectual Ventures in Bellevue, Wash., among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leo Blitz, director of the Radio Astronomy Laboratory, estimated that it would take three years and $41 million more, depending on the price of aluminum, to complete the array. The full array, astronomers say, will be useful not just for science, but also as practice for a truly giant telescope known as the Square Kilometer Array, which would have a combined receiving area of a square kilometer and which astronomers hope to build in Australia or South Africa in 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Blitz said the main advantage of the Allen array for regular radio astronomy was the ability to obtain images of large swaths of the sky, several times the size of the full moon, in a single pointing. At low frequencies, he said, the full array could map the entire sky in a day and night and do it again the next night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has not been possible before,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its partial form, Dr. Blitz said, the array is already almost as fast, and much cheaper to run, than larger telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speed should make it possible to catch transient events, like radio bursts from colliding black holes, that might last only a few hours, while the mapping ability should enable astronomers to search for lumps of gas without stars, the so-called dark galaxies predicted by the prevailing models of cosmology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for extraterrestrial intelligence has lived on the kindness of strangers since Congress canceled a NASA-sponsored search using existing radio telescopes in 1993, only a year after it had begun. The Seti Institute, which was to have conducted a search of nearby stars under contract to NASA, raised money from Silicon Valley and revived the search as Project Phoenix, using existing radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project Phoenix was finished three years ago, having checked some 750 stars for signals, Dr. Shostak said. While that might sound like a lot, he said, ''it doesn't impress anybody who knows how many stars there are in the galaxy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some 200 billion stars in the galaxy, and a significant fraction of them have planets. Estimates of the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy have ranged from one (or none, if you are particularly discouraged about human affairs) into the millions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Shostak calculated that the full Allen array would be able to detect a signal from as far as 500 light years that is only a few times more powerful than what can now be sent by the Arecibo radio telescope, a 1,000-foot-diameter dish in Puerto Rico that is the world's largest (although it is in danger of being shut down to save money). That translates to about a million stars, which he said was getting into a promising number. Dr. Shostak described the expanded search as looking for the needle in the proverbial haystack with a shovel instead of a spoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone out there and broadcasting, for whatever wacky alien reason, would also have to be broadcasting right at Earth. But advanced civilizations, Dr. Shostak said, would be able to tell there was life on Earth because of the oxygen in our atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been broadcasting that for 2.5 billion years,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first thing Dr. Shostak and his colleagues plan to do with the newly operational 42-antenna array is to survey a strip across the center of the galaxy. There will be several billion stars in the field of view, but they will be very far away, 10,000 to 50,000 light years, so any signal would have to be huge to be detected. But who is to say that among galactic civilizations there are not a rare few with tremendous capabilities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never begrudged aliens any power in their transmitter,'' Dr. Shostak said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 -- The space shuttle Discovery will launch on schedule next Tuesday even though questions remain about small defects on heat shield panels along its wings, NASA managers said Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an all-day meeting in which engineers debated technical issues that could affect the mission, managers decided to keep the shuttle's Oct. 23 launching date for a mission that will take a key component to the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the space shuttle program, said there were still questions about the degrading of a coating on 3 of 44 panels on the leading edges of the Discovery's wings. While not fully understood, Mr. Hale said, the problem appeared to be an acceptable risk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that the shuttle is an experimental vehicle that should never be considered completely safe to fly, Mr. Hale said managers who heard all the arguments voted to fly on schedule, although some had a few reservations. Mr. Hale said the decision was not made to keep the shuttle launching program on schedule, a criticism of the space agency that was voiced by investigators after the 2003 Columbia accident.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not going to let schedule drive us into making a decision,'' Mr. Hale said at a news conference late Tuesday after the meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. ''The preponderance of evidence, in my mind, is that we have an acceptable risk to go fly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leading edges of a shuttle's wings must withstand some of the most searing heat of re-entry, with temperatures that reach up to 3,000 degrees. NASA has been particularly concerned about the vehicle's heat shield since the Columbia and its crew of seven were lost because of unnoticed damage that occurred during launching when a piece of insulating foam struck and punched a hole in a panel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of engineers at NASA's Engineering Safety Center, which was set up after the Columbia disaster to provide independent advice on safety issues, had recommended replacing three of the Discovery's wing panels because a new test suggested that slight degradation of part of their surface could cause a panel to fail during a flight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said agency managers decided to proceed because of uncertainty about the meaning of the new test results and because shuttle crew members can now inspect and repair some heat shield damage during a mission. Replacing the panels would have required removing the Discovery from the launching pad, delaying its next flight by 60 days when there was no certainty of a genuine problem, he said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration canceled one of its two agreements to provide seed money to companies hoping to provide space transport services. The agency had paid $32 million of the more than $200 million set aside through the commercial orbital transportation services project for Rocketplane Kistler, an aerospace company in Oklahoma City, and said it would start a competition to find a new recipient of the remaining $174 million. Rocketplane Kistler had missed fund-raising milestones, said Alan Lindenmoyer, manager of NASA's commercial crew and cargo program office. George French Sr., chief executive of Rocketplane Kistler, expressed disappointment, but said, ''I am very proud of the technical progress our superb team has made over the last year.'' The other company receiving program money, the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of El Segundo, Calif., is ''proceeding very well,'' despite delays, Mr. Lindenmoyer said.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is planning to launch the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, beginning a mission to the International Space Station so crowded with construction tasks that one of the astronauts, the four-time space veteran Scott E. Parazynski, has called the challenge ''off-scale high.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a conflict has emerged in recent weeks about whether this mission should be launching at all, and a last-minute dispute -- in which NASA officials overruled safety engineers -- is raising fundamental questions about the risks of the aging shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In defending the decision that launching involved ''acceptable risk,'' N. Wayne Hale Jr., the manager of the shuttle program, acknowledged last week that the craft ''is not a safe vehicle by any normal standard.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well, the mission will be a high point in the efforts to complete the space station before the shuttle program is wound down by 2010. The Discovery's seven astronauts, working with the three-member space station crew, will add the first new ''room'' in six years. The closet-sized Harmony module will allow two new laboratories, from Europe and Japan, to be hooked up on future flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in a set of unprecedented maneuvers, the crew will move a solar array and truss from atop the station to its permanent home on the far end of the port arm, and will extend the solar panels that were folded during previous missions. ''When we leave the station, it's going to look a whole lot different than when we joined it,'' said Col. George D. Zamka of the Marine Corps, the pilot for the mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work will require five spacewalks and the extensive use of robotic arms. Moving the 17.5-ton solar array and truss alone, Dr. Parazynski said, is ''perhaps one of the most audacious things that we've done in space.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cloud over the ambitious mission is, once again, safety. Engineers at the NASA Engineering and Safety Center have argued that the launching should be delayed until December so that at least three heat-resistant panels on the leading edge of the craft's wings can be replaced.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts at the center, which was formed after the Columbia tragedy to act as a second opinion on safety issues, expressed concerns that the protective coating on the panels was showing a surprising amount of decay -- more than the previously accepted methods for testing the panels would suggest. They now believe that they do not fully understand the process of deterioration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though there were no official dissents entered against the decision to launch, NASA's chief engineer wrote his concerns into the record. The safety center, which does not have a vote in the matter, did not change its recommendation against launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale conceded that in the worst case, the decay could lead to a burned-through panel and the ''catastrophic loss of vehicle,'' but he insisted that the possibility was remote. Even if there is damage, it can be detected and repaired in orbit, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to launch has drawn criticism from some who say it mirrors schedule-driven decisions that doomed the crews of the Challenger in 1986 and the Columbia in 2003. The newspaper Florida Today published an editorial last Monday that criticized the agency for ''rolling the dice'' and argued that flying now was ''a risk NASA should not take.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harmony module is inextricably linked to the loss of the Columbia. The module was originally called Node 2, and NASA's leaders exerted intense pressure to launch it by February 2004, a year after the Columbia was to launch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia Accident Investigation Board report noted that before the accident, NASA was hard-pressed to prove it could meet schedules and budgets. If the launching deadline could not be met, it was believed, ''NASA would risk losing support from the White House and Congress for subsequent space station growth,'' the board said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA headquarters even sent a computer screen saver to managers in the human spaceflight program that displayed a live countdown to Feb. 19, 2004 -- the official date for the Node 2 launch -- in days, hours, minutes and seconds. That pressure led managers to cut corners, the safety board found, especially in its consideration of the threats of insulating foam.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the Columbia's ascent, a 1.67-pound piece of foam broke from a ramp on the external fuel tank and smashed into the leading edge of the shuttle's left wing. During re-entry two weeks later, superheated plasma entered the wing like a torch and destroyed the craft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials and many workers say the space agency has changed since then. Derek Hassman, the lead station flight director for the coming mission, recalled at a press conference that in the old days, ''Node 2 was held up as the be all and end all of the assembly sequence.'' Now, he said, ''I can say from my perspective, it's night and day.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a press conference on Tuesday, officials said that all concerns had been taken seriously and that the space agency would continue to work on getting a better understanding of the panel issue. ''I would love to be in a position of saying we understand all of our problems completely,'' Mr. Hale said, but ''the fact of the matter is that this is a very complicated vehicle -- this is an old vehicle -- and there are a lot of loose ends out there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela A. Melroy, the mission's commander and a retired Air Force colonel, said she and the crew were comfortable with the decision to launch. ''With a 12-hour discussion, I feel very confident that everybody's voice was heard,'' she said in a press conference on the shuttle runway as the crew arrived at Kennedy Space Center on Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Colonel Melroy, Colonel Zamka and Dr. Parazynski, the crew includes Paolo A. Nespoli, an Italian representing the European Space Agency; Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army; and Stephanie D. Wilson. A seventh astronaut, Daniel M. Tani, will be on board to take his place aboard the space station with its commander, Peggy A. Whitson, and Col. Yuri I. Malenchenko, a Russian flight engineer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew will bring back Clayton C. Anderson, who has served aboard the station since June. By coincidence, it will be the first time that there will be two female commanders in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, the director of the Institute of Space Policy at George Washington University and a member of the Columbia investigation board, acknowledged that the run-up to the mission ''has some resemblance to the normalization of deviance,'' using the term for the gradual playing down of safety concerns in the Challenger and Columbia disasters. ''Clearly, there is some schedule pressure,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Logsdon said he was loath to second-guess NASA's current leadership, including Mr. Hale; William H. Gerstenmaier, the human spaceflight chief; and the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin. He said they were ''extremely competent engineers'' who had ''heard all the pros and cons'' and operated under a bright spotlight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a gutsy call,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''It's their job to make these tough judgments. I'm glad I'm not them.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 -- A House committee said Monday that it would hold hearings into why the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is withholding 24,000 responses by pilots for airlines and other companies to a government-sponsored safety survey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel asked the agency to hand over an electronic copy of the data to ensure that it would not be destroyed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee and the agency are arguing over a telephone survey of about 8,000 pilots, conducted repeatedly over several months in an effort to track safety problems and determine if they were worsening. The survey was recommended in 1997 by a White House panel on aviation safety. The interviews were completed in early 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questionnaires ask about bird strikes, near misses in the air and on runways, last-second changes in landing instructions from air traffic controllers and other problems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two people involved in the data gathering, who would speak only if they were not identified publicly because they had been ordered by NASA not to discuss the findings, said the answers indicated the Federal Aviation Administration had underestimated the rate of safety-related events.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokesman, David Mould, said Monday that the purpose of the study was ''to develop methodologies'' for analyzing data, not to find what the data would show. But Mr. Mould said the data from the questionnaires would be turned over to an airline pilots' union and to a partnership between the airlines and the F.A.A., possibly by year's end.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deputy associate administrator for aviation safety at the F.A.A., Peggy Gilligan, said her agency had been briefed on the survey results but had not examined the underlying data. But she cast doubt on its value, saying the answers were not sufficiently detailed to determine, for example, whether two pilots describing similar problems were in fact talking about the same event.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gilligan and the agency's acting administrator, Bobby Sturgell, said they did not know whether the NASA data in fact recorded higher rates than their agency did of events like planes coming too close on the runway surface or in the air.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.A.A. said some problems covered by the questionnaire were becoming less severe, as measured by its own data, which it characterized as more detailed and rigorous. The number of ''runway incursions,'' in which a plane, vehicle or even a person is on the wrong spot on a runway, is down, it said, and the number of times that planes aloft came too close together has also declined.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency is undertaking an urgent program, with the airports and the airlines, to reduce the risk of runway collision, and has been criticized by the National Transportation Safety Board for not developing a cockpit warning system to prevent runway collisions. It is speeding the deployment of a system that warns tower controllers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Associated Press had sought the NASA survey data under the Freedom of Information Act. The news agency reported Monday that in a letter refusing the request, NASA said release of the data ''could materially affect the public confidence in, and the commercial welfare of, the air carriers and general aviation companies whose pilots participated in the survey.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.A.A. has long struggled with what to say publicly about the safety of individual airports or airlines. The agency was established in part to promote aviation, but in 1996, Congress decided that this job was in conflict with its role as a regulator, and removed promotion from its mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's mission includes helping to sustain the United States' pre-eminence in aviation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina and chairman of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology, wrote in a letter to the NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, that possible damage to the image of the airline industry ''does not appear to fall within any of the exceptions'' to the Freedom of Information law, and that not releasing the information would be contrary to NASA's mission of improving the safety and efficiency of airplanes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protecting airlines from public concern about safety, Mr. Miller said, was not part of the agency's mission.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite warnings of a possible accident, the space shuttle Discovery is poised to undertake the most challenging construction job yet attempted in space. It is another gutsy call by NASA administrators, who are determined to finish building the International Space Station by 2010, the date the aging shuttle fleet is scheduled to be retired.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be an extremely strenuous mission. The seven astronauts aboard Discovery, working with the three crew members aboard the partly finished space station, will attach a new ''room'' to the space station for the first time in six years. It is a small module, the size of a closet, that will allow laboratories from Europe and Japan to be attached to the space station on future flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts will also disconnect, move and reconnect a huge truss and solar arrays, and will test a pressurized caulking device that could be used to repair minor damage in space. It is an audacious agenda that will require five space walks and extensive use of robotic arms operating at their limits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nail-biting element was added when NASA's independent safety engineers urged that the launch be delayed for two months so that three heat-resistant panels on the shuttle's wings could be replaced or at least tested more thoroughly. The panels were showing signs of decay for reasons not fully understood, raising concerns that they might weaken enough to allow hot gases to penetrate and destroy the craft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After vigorous debate at an all-day review, however, NASA's top managers concluded that the risk was acceptable. Should the panels' defects worsen during flight, the astronauts could attempt a repair in space or board the space station to await rescue by another shuttle. The astronauts, who were fully informed of the debate, endorsed the decision to launch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll keep our fingers crossed that these judgments prove right. Another shuttle catastrophe would not only cost the lives of astronauts, it would also probably end the shuttle program and greatly delay completion of the space station.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA prepared to launch the space shuttle Discovery today, but poor weather at Cape Canaveral might cause the launching, scheduled for 11:38 a.m., to be delayed by a day or more. Katherine A. Winters, the shuttle launching weather officer, said there was a 60 percent probability that rain or other weather conditions would force a delay. The local forecast improves slightly for Wednesday and Thursday. The Discovery and its crew of seven astronauts are set to embark on an ambitious construction mission to the International Space Station that includes five spacewalks and the delivery of an addition to the living and working space, the Harmony module.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Oct. 23 -- The shuttle Discovery thundered off the pad on Tuesday morning, heading toward the International Space Station with a new Harmony module that will add living space to the orbiting laboratory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite weather concerns and a small chunk of ice that threatened to delay the beginning of the 14-day mission, everything seemed to fall into place in the final minutes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Booster ignition and liftoff of Discovery,'' the NASA launching commentator, Mike Curie, said as the engines started with their rasping roar. ''Hoisting Harmony to the heavens and opening new gateways for international science.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle punched through clouds on its way into the noonday sky, briefly turning them brilliant yellow, and moved on toward its rendezvous with the station on Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary look at the launching debris -- bits of insulating foam and ice that fall off the external tank and can damage the tiles and panels that protect the shuttle in re-entry -- showed nothing that officials said was a cause for concern.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a call to the astronauts from the ground, Col. Terry W. Virts of the Air Force, an astronaut who is ''capsule communicator'' with the crew, told Pamela A. Melroy, the commander of the 120th space shuttle mission, about ''several events'' involving debris.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Colonel Virts said, all of it appeared to have fallen off of the tank after the period early in ascent when aerodynamics and shuttle speed create the riskiest conditions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Looked like a pretty clean ascent,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Great news,'' Ms. Melroy replied. ''Thank you.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be several days before NASA can say whether there was damage to the leading-edge panels of the shuttle wings, a subject of an internal dispute in the weeks before the launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some NASA engineers argued that the mission should be delayed until December so that at least three heat-resistant panels found to have surprising deterioration to their protective coatings could be replaced.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers said that they ruled against the delay because there was no evidence that the condition might worsen and that any damage could be detected in the on-orbit inspection that is now part of every flight and could be repaired with newly developed techniques and materials.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Ms. Melroy, who retired from the Air Force as a colonel, the crew includes the pilot, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marines, Scott E. Parazynski, Stephanie D. Wilson, Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army and Paolo A. Nespoli, an Italian representing the European Space Agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A seventh astronaut, Daniel M. Tani, will trade places aboard the station with Clayton C. Anderson, who has been aboard the station since June.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will pack a large number of construction tasks into its two weeks. Not only will the astronauts be transporting the new ''room'' for the station, the first addition to the living space in six years, but the combined crews of the shuttle and station will also pluck a 17.5-ton solar array and truss from its current position atop the station and move it to its permanent position at the farthest end of the port truss. That operation will require delicate handoffs between the robot and station arms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This one is almost like two missions in one,'' said Sandra H. Magnus, an astronaut who flew on the shuttle Atlantis in 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for space operations, told reporters after the launching: ''There's nothing here that stands out as an individual task that is more complicated than what we've attempted before. But it's the culmination of all these tasks coming together in one flight in a fairly compressed period of time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is crucial to construction on the station, said Richard R. Arnold II, an astronaut who will ride the shuttle next fall to carry the final solar array to the station. Having the Harmony module in place will allow crews to take up and connect laboratories built by European and Japanese space agencies. ''We're going to be able to make this International Space Station truly international,'' Mr. Arnold said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Thursday about the launching of China's first lunar probe misspelled the given name of a top scientist with the Chinese space program who said lunar exploration would strengthen the country's international prestige and national pride. He is Ouyang Ziyuan, not Ouyang Ziyang.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Oct 27 2007    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING, Oct. 24 -- With a regional space race heating up in Asia, China launched its first lunar probe on Wednesday as the Communist Party moved a step closer to fulfilling its ambitions of one day reaching the moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chang'e-1 satellite, named after a Chinese goddess who flew to the moon, lifted off at 6:05 p.m. Officials and tourists watched the launching at a site in Sichuan Province, while state television provided coverage to the rest of the nation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The probe is expected to orbit the moon for the next year, providing satellite images and other information as China prepares to launch a space vehicle to the moon by 2012 and then send an astronaut by 2020. Within an hour of blastoff the probe's solar panels had been activated, and space officials declared the launching a success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The launch was very successful, and everything is proceeding just as planned,'' Wu Ji, director of the Space Science and Applied Research Center, told Xinhua, China's state-run news agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, China's space program has attracted international attention for its ambitions and fast-rising technological prowess. In 2003, China became only the third nation after the United States and the former Soviet Union to send a man into orbit -- a feat it has since replicated. However, the United States and other nations reacted with alarm when China successfully blasted one of its own aging weather satellites out of orbit in a military test.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is not the only emerging space power in Asia. Last month, Japan stole a bit of China's thunder by launching its own lunar probe, and India plans its own lunar orbiter next year. Technological development is a motivator for all three countries, but so are nationalistic pride and regional rivalry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As lunar exploration embodies our overall national strength, it is very significant for raising our international prestige and our national unity,'' Ouyang Ziyang, a top scientist with China's space program, told People's Daily, the Communist Party's most authoritative newspaper.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has a mandate to enhance the safety of air travel, has been suppressing huge quantities of data that apparently show the risks for civilian aircraft are much higher than commonly estimated. The agency's lame excuses for refusing to release the information must make any traveler wonder how bad the implications might be.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, NASA began interviewing airline and general aviation pilots about how often they saw risky incidents, like near collisions, or stressful last- second changes in landing instructions. Some 24,000 interviews were conducted over a four-year period before the program, and plans to interview air traffic controllers, flight attendants and mechanics, were scrapped.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When The Associated Press sought the data under the Freedom of Information Act, the request was rejected by a high NASA official. He said releasing the data ''could materially affect the public confidence in, and the commercial welfare of, the air carriers and general aviation companies whose pilots participated in the survey.'' NASA's mandate is not to protect the commercial welfare of the airline industry, it is to enhance the safety of all who fly. It also apparently never occurred to NASA that suppressing this data could damage public confidence even more than releasing it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person familiar with the results told The A.P. that that pilots reported at least twice as many bird strikes, near midair collisions and runway incursions as other government monitoring systems show. Another person involved in the survey told us that the rates were higher than government regulators had been recording.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA now says the study was designed to develop a survey methodology, not to assess air carrier safety. It plans to complete a report on the methodology by year's end. That is not enough. In responding to the furor, NASA's administrator, Michael Griffin said, ''NASA should focus on how we can provide information to the public -- not on how we can withhold it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We agree. Mr. Griffin should ensure that his agency analyzes its survey and then releases that analysis and all the interview data so that other experts can analyze it as well.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, Oct. 25 -- A hug on Thursday between the commanders of the space shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station marked the first time that women have served in both roles at the same time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by the shuttle commander, Pamela A. Melroy, and the station commander, Peggy A. Whitson, the crews met with shouts of greeting and hearty embraces as the two vehicles made their way around the earth at 17,000 miles per hour, crossing over North Carolina.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle docked with the space station at 8:40 a.m. Eastern time after it was put through a back flip to allow astronauts on the station to photograph its belly. Analysts on the ground will study the pictures for signs of damage from debris on liftoff.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The back flip maneuver is now part of every shuttle mission to the space station. It was begun after the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003 in an accident traced to damage by debris during the launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview before the mission, Commander Melroy, a retired Air Force colonel, said that performing the back flip so close to the station -- just 600 feet away -- was counterintuitive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But time in the simulator made the pilots comfortable with the idea, the commander said. ''It becomes completely obvious why it is safe to do,'' she said. Experts are still analyzing the pictures from the back flip and other sources of data on the ascent, and ''they have not seen anything that would cause them concern at this time,'' John Shannon, the chairman of the mission management team, said in an afternoon briefing with reporters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before the crew day officially ended, an astronaut, Dominic A. Antonelli, called Discovery from mission control to tell Ms. Melroy that officials had preliminarily decided that the shuttle came through its ascent with so little damage that they would probably not call for a ''focused inspection,'' which would require more than three hours, midway through the flight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, man, that is fantastic news!'' Ms. Melroy exclaimed over the radio link. ''It's obviously been a question that's very much on our minds.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, ''We're pretty excited to hear about that'' and added that it would give her team more time to work with the Harmony module, the first new living space for the station in six years. ''We just can't wait to get inside,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The docking began 10 days of intense and challenging activity on the 14-day mission, starting with work on Friday to install Harmony. In addition, an enormous solar array and truss will be moved into their permanent position.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told my team before we started this mission, 'This is the kind of mission we came to NASA for,' '' Mr. Shannon said. ''This is why we're here.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, Oct. 26 -- Astronauts added the newest room to the International Space Station Friday morning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working both outside the station and within it, the astronauts moved the Harmony module, which will serve as a connection point for two new laboratories, to a temporary location.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station's robot arm, operated by Stephanie D. Wilson and Daniel M. Tani, smoothly moved the 16-ton module out of the shuttle and onto the station, where automatic bolts secured it in place in a temporary home on the left side of the station's living quarters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work outside was more strenuous. Scott E. Parazynski and Col. Douglas H. Wheelock began their spacewalk shortly after 6 a.m. Eastern time. They prepared the Harmony module for its removal from the shuttle's payload bay and performed some of the preliminary work for the other big task of the mission, moving an enormous set of solar arrays and the truss they stand on from their initial position atop the station to the permanent home on the far end of the truss on the station's left side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, technical difficulties on the mission have been minor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So little insulating foam was shed from the shuttle's external tank that mission managers have determined that a more focused inspection of the shuttle's heat shield is unnecessary. When that word was passed up to the shuttle on Thursday afternoon before the crew's sleep period was to begin, the shuttle commander, Pamela A. Melroy, responded enthusiastically, ''Oh, man, that is fantastic news.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Melroy said that it was a relief to know that tile and panel damage was not a concern and that they would be able to take the time that would have gone to inspection and use it to further prepare the Harmony module for entry. ''We just can't wait to get inside,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, for the most part, went smoothly. The astronauts struggled occasionally with balky bolts and hose connectors, which are optimistically called ''quick disconnect'' devices. They were wary of the small amounts of frozen ammonia that drifted away from some of the hoses, because they could contaminate the atmosphere within the station if brought in on the spacesuits. The amount of ammonia, which is used as a coolant, was small.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, Paolo A. Nespoli, the Italian astronaut who was coordinating the spacewalk from inside the station, asked his colleagues to take a short break to enjoy what might be the greatest perk of working in space: the view. Mr. Nespoli asked them to look over the starboard side as the station passed over Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two spacewalkers oohed and aahed as the familiar coastline slid by below.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hello, Houston!'' Dr. Parazynski said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers were back in the airlock before noon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the communications system, Ms. Melroy congratulated Dr. Parazynski and Colonel Wheelock on the work of the entire team, which she said she watched while making lunch for the crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know that anybody's ever told our crew that we bring Harmony with us,'' she said, ''but we sure bring fun.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an afternoon briefing, mission managers applauded the success of the spacewalk -- one of a series of tightly choreographed activities over the next few days for this shuttle mission and the station crew afterward. But they said they would add a task to the next spacewalk, on Sunday, to investigate a problem with a rotating joint that keeps the station's solar arrays facing the sun on orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Shireman, the deputy program manager for the station program, said the rotary joint on the right side of the station had been experiencing unusual vibrations and spikes in electrical current that suggest it was having to work harder than it should. Mission managers have decided to have spacewalkers take time out from their other duties on Sunday to look at the joint in hope of finding a simple answer to the mystery, like a bolt out of place or an insulating blanket that is being dragged along the joint.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ   </div><div>587 words</div><div>29 October 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spacewalking astronauts yesterday found evidence of damage to a crucial part of the International Space Station's power system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of what appear to be metallic shavings in one of the station's enormous rotating joint assemblies suggested problems for the orbiting space station that could affect ambitious plans to add two power-hungry laboratories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem was found during the second of five scheduled spacewalks of the space shuttle Discovery's current mission. The astronauts Scott E. Parazynski and Daniel M. Tani unbuckled a solar array atop the space station so it could be relocated and made progress on outfitting the exterior of the station's newest room, the Harmony module.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The part in question, known as the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, or SARJ, is 10 feet across; one sits toward each end of the station's long truss. The motorized joint allows solar panels to rotate and constantly face the sun during the sunny part of each orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's quite clear,'' said Mr. Tani, describing what he saw after removing a protective cover over an assembly of gears and bearings. ''There's metal-to-metal scraping, or something, and it's widespread.'' Mr. Tani collected some of the material with tape.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp-eyed space station flight controller had noticed several weeks ago that the joint on the right side of the station was experiencing unusual vibrations as it rotated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further examination revealed that the motor on that joint was using greater-than-expected amounts of current, which suggested that it was having to work harder than it should to turn the 30,000-pound paddle wheel-like array. So on Friday, mission managers added the inspection to the spacewalk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers said in a briefing yesterday that the origin of the shavings was unclear. The leading theory, they said, was that a foil backing of aluminized Mylar on a protective cover could be rubbing against the mechanism and shredding into it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA might have astronauts take off the other 21 covers, one by one, to see if any have been damaged in that way; this could happen on an additional spacewalk or on one already planned. Even if the source of the shavings is identified, however, cleaning the mechanism will be difficult.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station program manager, Michael T. Suffredini, said the troubled joint would be ''parked'' in a position that allowed it to pick up a fair amount of sunlight while NASA continued to investigate. He said though the calculations were still being worked through, he believed ''we'll have the power we need.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem could have effects that ripple beyond this mission because additional laboratory modules are likely to require more power than the current configuration can produce. Also, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to fly an additional solar array to the station next year for the same joint, which adds pressure to resolve the problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rotary joint system is built with a measure of redundancy, and there are backup motors and controllers for each rotary joint, with an additional race, or ring, for the motors to turn the joint already on the wheel. So if a solution cannot be found with the existing set-up, Mr. Suffredini said, a complex switch-over might restore the system to full operation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Suffredini added, ''that would require multiple spacewalks and is strictly last resort.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA mission managers will add a day to the mission of the space shuttle Discovery so crew members can do ''exploratory surgery'' on a malfunctioning part of the International Space Station's power system, the space agency announced yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem concerns a rotary joint on the right side of the station that turns the station's solar arrays so they face the sun during orbit. During an initial examination on Sunday, the spacewalking astronaut Daniel M. Tani collected what he called ''metal-to-metal scraping'' that peppered the inside of the joint mechanism. Mr. Tani picked up some of the fragments with tape and took them back into the space station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers hoped the shavings were aluminized Mylar, a foil used as backing on the insulating covers, and not steel, which would suggest that the mechanism is grinding against itself. They asked Peggy A. Whitson, the space station commander, to conduct an experiment of putting some of the filings on a piece of paper and running a magnet underneath.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aluminum is not magnetic; steel is. The filings ''followed the magnet around,'' Michael T. Suffredini, the space station program manager, said yesterday morning in a briefing with reporters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission controllers had known of the problem for several weeks, when a mission control contractor noticed an unusual vibration. Station managers have decided to lock the array in a position that allows it to collect a fair amount of sunlight until the problem can be fully investigated and resolved.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strategy will keep the joint from literally grinding to a halt, but will limit the amount of electricity the station can generate for itself and an attached shuttle. That is not a problem for the current mission, Mr. Suffredini said, or for the next mission, in December, when a new science module will be brought up and attached.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the problem is not corrected and the rotation resumed, further construction could be constrained by the ability to provide power.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think we're in any situation we can't recover from,'' Mr. Suffredini said. ''It's just a matter of time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini announced two initial moves to get a better sense of the problem. Today, another spacewalker, Scott E. Parazynski, will peek inside the opposite rotary joint on the left side, which is running smoothly, to help engineers and scientists ''figure out what normal means'' and compare that with what they are seeing on the right side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the fourth spacewalk, which was to be a demonstration of shuttle repair techniques, will be extended to six hours or more and devoted entirely to taking each of the 22 insulating covers off the right joint and examining the mechanism -- a process that Mr. Suffredini called ''exploratory surgery.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems of the rotary joint came to the fore during a mission that has otherwise gone smoothly. The day's activities included an agile robotic handoff between the space station and shuttle robotic arms of a solar array and truss to relocate the 17.5-ton assembly to its permanent home on the station's left side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the crew day, viewers of NASA TV (  www.nasa.gov/ntv  [http://www.nasa.gov/ntv]) were treated to the sight of the astronauts' taking advantage of a bit of leisure time, cavorting in zero gravity, tumbling and flying past one another in formation as if they were comic-book superheroes at play.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cmdr. Dominic A. Antonelli of the Navy, an astronaut on the ground communicating with the crew, used the nickname of the shuttle's pilot, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marine Corps, saying, ''Now we know what Zambo means when he says it's hard to go to bed on time.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clayton Anderson is an orbital hitchhiker. When the mission of the space shuttle Discovery comes to an end, Mr. Anderson -- who has been living aboard the International Space Station since June -- will get a ride home. Daniel Tani, who came up with the rest of Discovery's crew last week, will stay behind for his rotation aboard the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In orbit, Mr. Anderson has worked on the station and walked in space -- and even pushed a 1,500-pound, refrigerator-sized ammonia container away from the station to burn up in the atmosphere. He has also brought an amiably goofball sensibility to the orbiting laboratory, engaging the ground crew in daily trivia contests that often include questions about Nebraska, his home state, or challenging them to provide the punch lines to jokes. (Example: What's the difference between roast beef and pea soup? The answer: Anyone can roast beef.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearing the end of his stay, he agreed to answer questions, via e-mail:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What's it been like spending so much time in a relatively small space?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Surprisingly, I have had no feelings of ''claustrophobia.'' The current volume is approximately the size of a three-bedroom home, so with a typical crew size of three, it is an ample amount of space and you can find places for privacy if you need it!   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Some critics of the space agency say the program is just going in circles in low-earth orbit. What's the value of the station for the people who are footing the bill?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Our station crew has been doing valuable science onboard...not enough to suit me personally, but it's important stuff. We are performing combustion experiments to enable us to develop better smoke detectors for spacecraft, and the spin-offs from those advances will one day be in our homes. We are working on new atmospheric monitoring technologies, which may one day enable miners to quickly and accurately assess the atmospheric compositions deep in their mines. It just takes a bit of time to see these things come to fruition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How have you kept your relationship with your wife and kids strong over this long absence?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Life on the I.S.S. today is considerably better than that of the astronauts who lived here when the outpost first became ''manned.'' Today we have e-mail, weekly video conferences with our families and the opportunity to make telephone calls to anywhere in the world through an Internet protocol telephone! I estimate that I talk to my wife daily and my two children at least twice every week. It has made a big difference for me to be able to ''keep up'' with their activities, problems and successes. I am also able to receive electronic files from home that include photographs, videos and music.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What's the best part of walking in space?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Being able to be a small part of such a huge assembly task as building the International Space Station is quite a thrill for me. And, the views that I experienced while outside of the I.S.S. were absolutely spectacular. I will remember forever my first EVA [extravehicular activity] and our pass northwest to southeast over the United States. Entering near Seattle, Wash., and crossing over the Rockies and then catching the Great Salt Lake, all while riding on the Canadian arm carrying a 1,500-pound soon-to-be-piece of space junk, it just doesn't get much better than that!   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You've been shown playing a music keyboard up there. What have you been playing and singing?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I dabble in songwriting and have been trying to write a new composition. My time has been limited, and I have not made much progress.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Did you have the problems with nausea that many first-time astronauts experience?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I was very fortunate and did not feel any inkling of any kind of ''space adaptation syndrome (S.A.S.).'' When we reached orbit and zero gravity on STS-117, I was ready to go to work and kept asking when it was time to eat!   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What are some of the things that surprised you about orbital life?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I was really surprised at how difficult simple tasks can become without gravity. Just trying to write something down on a piece of paper is somewhat of an ordeal until you ''figure it out'' in your brain. Also, working with tools that I have often used on the ground presented challenges in zero G, as your ability to ''anchor'' yourself becomes very challenging...but it's also kind of fun to spin around while you try to use a ratchet wrench!   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What have you missed the most?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, I knew that I would miss my wife and children and close friends...that was a given. But I guess one of the things I miss the most is the ''outdoors.'' The smells, the feel of the breeze, the changes in temperature after a good front passes through. Those are things you simply cannot experience up here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How does it feel having been unable to take a shower for so long?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We keep quite clean using ''sponge baths.'' We have liquid soap and shampoo that allows us to stay almost ''squeaky'' clean. I haven't really thought about a shower, but now that you mention it...a nice long, hot shower will feel mighty good!   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solar panel on the International Space Station tore yesterday as the array was unfurled, presenting a new challenge for a space shuttle mission that has already had more than its share.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solar array, the second of two ''wings'' that were to be deployed in this mission of the shuttle Discovery, had been transferred from the top of the station to the far left side with its arrays retracted earlier in the day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array was being unfolded, accordion style, from its storage box and was nearly fully extended when it hit a snag. The shuttle commander, Pamela A. Melroy, who was working the controls, saw the two-and-a-half-foot rip in the panel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a wary voice, Ms. Melroy radioed to the ground, ''We, uh, detected some, what appears to be a wraparound or some damage.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gash was immediately visible on images broadcast live on NASA TV. A guide wire appeared to have caught on a hinge, Michael T. Suffredini, the space station manager, said in a downbeat briefing with reporters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a situation where anybody's particularly panicked,'' Mr. Suffredini said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ribbon cable that carries power back to the station was undamaged -- ''that's great news,'' he said -- and the panel continues to supply 97 percent of the power that it should.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panels were designed to be used in their fully extended, taut form. Keeping them partly extended could cause structural problems and complicate calculations for their response to thruster firings, docking with a space shuttle or even strenuous crew exercise, Mr. Suffredini said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the damage, managers have decided to lock the rotary joint that orients the array toward the sun. That means neither of the two rotary joints will be in use, impairing the solar panels' power production.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right-hand rotary joint has been locked for several days as managers investigate a problem that caused excessive vibration and energy use and that has fouled the mechanism with metal shavings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers had said the station would have plenty of power despite locking the right-hand joint, because it could still receive a fair amount of sunlight. That estimate was in part based on the left-side arrays' tracking the sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that array locked, Mr. Suffredini said, power woes could affect the timing of the next mission. The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to fly to the station as early as Dec. 6 to deliver a European-made science module.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In NASA scheduling parlance, that mission is known as the 1E flight, and Mr. Suffredini told reporters on Tuesday, ''I wouldn't want to plan a 1E flight until I knew a little better what was going on with this array.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers had decided to devote the next spacewalk of the Discovery mission, scheduled for Thursday, to examining the right-hand joint. But the solar array problem, which could have more near-term effects on power, might take precedence.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array will be hard to reach, managers said. Possible repairs include a spacewalk to reinforce the array, perhaps by strapping the torn panel to its neighbor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't have to look good,'' Mr. Suffredini said. ''It just has to give us power.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He voiced cautious optimism on resolving the problems with the array and rotary joint, saying: ''I, in my mind, have a path through the wilderness on both of these problems. It'll take time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As managers in Houston reviewed repair options, NASA officials in Washington announced the roles of each of its 10 field centers in returning astronauts to the moon by 2020.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard J. Gilbrech, who is in charge of the exploration program, said work on a large cargo rocket and lunar landing craft would begin in earnest in 2011, after the space shuttles are retired and the International Space Station is complete.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All field centers will have roles in developing and deploying elements for landers, shelters and other equipment, Mr. Gilbrech said. The Johnson Space Center in Houston will take the lead for the lunar lander crew module and surface living quarters. The Kennedy Space Center in Florida will be responsible for launching cargo rockets to take lunar hardware into earth orbit before putting it together before the moon trip, and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama will lead developing the lunar lander descent state.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced that it would establish a Lunar Science Institute managed by its Ames Research Center in California that will assemble interdisciplinary research teams to coordinate and expand plans for science on the moon. The agency will initially select four or five teams from universities, its own centers and private organizations and give them each grants of $1 million to $2 million for three years.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with two major problems on the International Space Station, NASA station managers shifted gears yesterday to an audacious effort to save a torn solar array.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacewalk that had been scheduled for today to examine problems with one of the station's rotary joints has been delayed a day and changed to address damage to an enormous solar array, which developed a two-and-a-half-foot rip and a smaller tear on Tuesday while being unfolded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The priority has become the solar array,'' said Derek Hassmann, the lead flight director for the station. If planning takes longer, the spacewalk will be pushed to Saturday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem appears to have started when a guide wire became hung up on one of the long hinges that join the fanfold panels of the array. Even though it is not fully extended, the panel is capable of generating nearly all of the power it should. But without the tautness of full extension, the array will not be structurally sound, said Michael T. Suffredini, the manager of the station program. Extending it would most likely increase the damage, and leaving it alone might allow the damage to increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the array cannot be repaired or stabilized, Mr. Suffredini said, ''we don't have a lot of options -- the most likely option is that we'd have to jettison it.'' And that would mean less power for the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the undamaged arrays produce enough power for the station now, the problem has implications for further growth. New modules scheduled to go up will need more power. Even procedures like the docking of shuttles could increase stress on the damaged array in its present condition, Mr. Suffredini said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan being developed by engineers and scientists working three shifts a day has a bit of the feel of a ''MacGyver'' episode. The damaged panels, out at the far left-hand side of the station, are hard to reach. But the teams have come up with a way to use a 50-foot-long boom that is normally used to extend the reach of the shuttle's robotic arm. By grappling the boom with the station's robotic arm and putting Scott E. Parazynski on the end, he will be able to reach the array and free the wire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leading plan then calls for Dr. Parazynski to use a wire-and-tape contraption that will be built by the astronauts after being designed by engineers on the ground. It should act like cufflinks: after threading it through reinforced holes that were put on the panels to secure them on the way to space, the ends will spread and hold the panels in place, taking the strain that the damaged panels can no longer sustain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini described the plan with an obvious sense of wonder. ''We give this team a little time to think about creative solutions, it doesn't take them long to really blow you away with the ideas they can come up with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle commander, Pamela A. Melroy, was working the controls that extended the array when she radioed to the ground and informed mission controllers of the damage. In a video press conference yesterday, Ms. Melroy said that ''it was a tough situation,'' and difficult to monitor the unfolding, because ''the sun was shining directly into our camera views.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're always going to second-guess ourselves,'' she said, ''and there might have been some other things we could have done,'' but added, ''I think we did as well as we could.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for any repair tasks, she said, ''I think we're kind of in the groove right now, so if the ground decides that's the right thing to do and they ask us to do it, we'll be ready to support it.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts will take part in an unusually risky spacewalk today in an effort to mend a torn solar array on the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the procedure, Scott E. Parazynski will be far out on a limb -- or, rather, out on the end of a 50-foot-long boom gripped by the space station's robotic arm. Dr. Parazynski will either unsnag or cut a wire that appears to have hung up on a hinge of a solar panel, putting two tears in a left-side solar array.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parazynski will carry a tool kit that includes a craft project put together based on instructions radioed from mission control -- five straps with ends like a cufflink's. They will be pushed through reinforced holes in the arrays that were manufactured to slide pins through for safe storage during ascent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The straps will bind the panels to their neighbors and take on the strain that the torn panels can no longer handle, allowing full deployment of the array. Col. Douglas H. Wheelock will be positioned at the base of the array to provide visual cues to Dr. Parazynski.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the procedure does not work, the array may have to be jettisoned, and construction on the station may be constrained by its reduced ability to produce power, especially because the right-hand side arrays are parked because of mechanical problems with the rotary joint that helps point them toward the Sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lead flight director for the station, Derek Hassmann, said, ''We need to address one of these two problems before we proceed'' with construction missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task will put Dr. Parazynski farther from the safety of the airlock than any astronaut has gone in the history of the station. If there are problems like glove damage or a failure of the oxygen supply, his returning to safety could take somewhat longer than the 30 minutes of backup oxygen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is just one of the worries tangled up in this hastily devised repair. It will also put Dr. Parazynski up against the electrically active array, which could send a nasty -- and, in the worst case, potentially fatal -- shock through his spacesuit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers say they are confident that despite the added risk, Dr. Parazynski will be safe. Astronauts have covered exposed metal on his suit and tools with insulating tape to prevent arcing. Mr. Hassmann said the likelihood of risk from shock was extremely small. ''We don't expect there to be any issue,'' he said.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Astronaut Fixes Damage To Solar Array on Station   </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOHN SCHWARTZ   </div><div>970 words</div><div>4 November 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An astronaut on a daring spacewalk yesterday repaired a damaged solar array on the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Scott E. Parazynski, a former emergency room physician, mended wounds on the wing, which developed two tears while being deployed Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the procedure had not been successful, the array, on the left side of the station, might have had to be discarded. The loss of a solar array would have reduced the ability to produce power, possibly constraining future construction on the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers knew that wires had become snagged and had torn the array during deployment. But they did not know the nature of the snag. They had hoped that repairs would be a simple matter of moving a wire off a hinge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parazynski, riding on an extension of the station's robotic arm to reach the damaged array, said his view of the repair site revealed a ''hairball'' of wire, with guide wire for the array caught in another wire running through the hinge connecting the panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at a close-up view available from Dr. Parazynski's helmet camera, Pamela A. Melroy, the commander of the space shuttle Discovery's current mission, said, ''Sounds like you have some surgery to do, Dr. Parazynski.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He inserted the first ''cufflink,'' a wire-and-metal contraption created by the astronauts using instructions from the ground, into place along the array shortly before 9 a.m. Eastern time. That stabilized the area around the tears so he could work on the wire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the sun at his back and his shadow sharp against the brilliantly golden array, Dr. Parazynski began cutting wires, cautiously planning each snip in consultation with Ms. Melroy and mission controllers on the ground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parazynski took care to keep clear of the swaying array, occasionally dampening its motion with a prodder shaped like a hockey stick. He cut out two offending lengths of wire and moved on to insert the remaining cufflinks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts inside the station then began the delicate process of extending the array to its full length, with Dr. Parazynski and Col. Douglas H. Wheelock, stationed at the base of the array, watching for any hint of trouble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cufflinks held. Cheers could be heard over the communications loop.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns going into the spacewalk focused on electrical hazards and possible damage to space suits. A list of warnings read to Dr. Parazynski by Paolo A. Nespoli, the Italian astronaut who was choreographing the spacewalk from the station, included touching sharp edges of bolts, solar cells, hinges and other areas of the array.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not sure there's much left to touch,'' Dr. Parazynski replied.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nespoli said, ''We're not even halfway through the warnings,'' and went on to warn against touching areas with ''pinch points'' and high electrical current, which carry a risk of shock and ''molten metal.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the procedure, Dr. Parazynski said he saw no sparks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parazynski, by coincidence, was one of the best astronauts for the unusual spacewalk. Now on his fifth trip to orbit, he has spent more time in spacewalks than all but four others in the history of the program. And, at 6 feet 2 inches, he is among the tallest astronauts and well-suited to work on the array from a safe distance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bit of a reach here,'' he said at one point.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Melroy responded, ''That's what those monkey arms are for,'' and then added, ''Not many people in the office could do what you're doing right now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To which Dr. Parazynski replied, ''I hope they don't have to.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only apparent slip-up came at the end of the spacewalk, which lasted more than seven hours. An errant set of needle-nose pliers floated away and could be spotted drifting below the station. Mission managers said the tool is not likely to pose a threat to the shuttle or station before falling back to Earth, but said they would track it on radar.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful repair makes it possible to shoot for launching the next module for the station, the European-made Columbus laboratory, early next month, said Michael T. Suffredini, the manager of the station program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after the spacewalk yesterday, the station still has one major problem: a damaged rotary joint on the right-hand side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew of Discovery will bring back some of the metal shavings from the joint when they return this week, as early as Wednesday. Those shavings, Mr. Suffredini said, will provide clues about which part is damaged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A full inspection of the joint, which was scheduled to take place during this mission, is now likely to be pushed back into next year, as will any repair.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini said the station's current power set-up, with one set of two arrays rotating and the right-side arrays parked but drawing a reasonable amount of sunlight, should give the station enough power to get through the December mission and perhaps well beyond.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repairs made to the solar array should hold through the predicted end of United States involvement in the station program in 2015, Mr. Suffredini said. It did, however, leave the array looking as though it had acquired a dueling scar.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea for this was to regain the functionality of the solar array,'' Mr. Suffredini explained. ''It wasn't about looking good when it was over with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array, he acknowledged, ''Doesn't quite look like we'd expected. But you know, it's just like anybody -- you have your baby, your baby is beautiful to you. Our baby is still beautiful to us.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say there is no place like home, but it is beginning to look as if there is a place sort of like home 41 light-years from here in the constellation Cancer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reported Tuesday that there were at least five planets circling a star there known as 55 Cancri, where only four had been known before, making it the most extensive planetary system yet found outside our own. It is also the one that most resembles our solar system, with a giant planet orbiting far out from the star and four smaller ones circling closer in.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new addition to the system circles 55 Cancri at roughly the distance of Venus in our own solar system, in the so-called habitable zone where it is warm enough for liquid water. But, with 45 times the mass of Earth, the planet is more apt to resemble Neptune or Saturn than Earth, and thus would be a deadly environment for any kind of life that we know.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a system that appears to be packed with planets,'' Prof. Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University said of 55 Cancri. She is the leader of the team that reported its results in a paper to be published in The Astrophysical Journal and in a telephone news conference on Tuesday from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists said the discovery augured well for the chance that with time and more data, astronomers would find places out there that look like home. They also said it marked the beginning of a transition between studying planets and studying planetary systems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another team member, Geoff Marcy, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said the discovery had him ''jumping out of my socks.'' He said, ''We now know our Sun and its family of planets is not unusual.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan I. Lunine, a professor at the University of Arizona who was not part of the work, said that astronomers were on the verge of beginning to answer a question posed by Albertus Magnus, the medieval German philosopher and priest who wondered whether there was but one world or many worlds. We now know, Dr. Lunine said, ''how lonely the universe is, how far we live from distant stars.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade, about 250 planets have been discovered around other stars -- the vast majority of them by the so-called wobble technique of monitoring a star's light for signs of the slight to-and-fro motion induced by the gravitational tugs of orbiting planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As technology and techniques have improved, the planet hunters have been able to move down the scale from Jupiter-size planets to ones only a few times as massive as Earth. But detecting rocky planets like Earth is probably beyond the current technology and must await future space-based missions, the astronomers admit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first of these ''exoplanets'' discovered, in 1996, was at 55 Cancri. Dr. Fischer and her colleagues have been observing that star for 18 years, adding more planets to the list of its retinue as they have made their presence known.The outermost and heaviest planet in the system, which is four times as massive as Jupiter, circles at a distance of 500 million miles, slightly farther than Jupiter in our own system, and takes 14 years to complete an orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star's three innermost planets all circle more tightly than Mercury at distances from 22 million to 3.5 million miles. The closest of three is also the smallest, only 18 as massive as Earth and surely permanently scorched.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet, which Dr. Fischer called ''one of the more annoying planets'' because it resisted being folded into their mathematical models for such a long time, basks in the lukewarm light of its star from a distance of around 70 million miles, taking 260 days to complete one orbit. Although too massive for life itself, Dr. Marcy said, the planet could harbor rocky moons, just as Saturn and Neptune in our own solar system do, and these would be warmed to the same lukewarm temperatures as Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moons would have to be as massive as Mars, however, in order to keep their water from escaping into empty space. Dr. Marcy said, ''All bets are off on what evolutionary biology would be like on one of these moons.''The astronomers said they were also intrigued by the large gap -- a band about 450 million miles across -- between the new planet and the outermost one, in which they have detected nothing. There is a similar, but smaller, gap in our own solar system between Jupiter and Mars, caused by the disruptive effects of Jovian gravity on planetary formation. Dr. Lunine suggested that the more massive Cancri planet could have had a similar and deeper disruptive effect.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the possibility remains that rocky planets could be lurking beneath detectability in that gap. Dr. Lunine said, ''This gives us a name and an address to point out space telescopes at in the future.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade, about 250 planets have been discovered around other stars -- the vast majority by the so-called wobble technique of monitoring a star's light for signs of the slight to-and-fro motion induced by the gravitational tugs of orbiting planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As technology and techniques have improved, planet hunters have been able to move down the scale from Jupiter-size planets to ones only a few times as massive as Earth. But detecting rocky planets like Earth is probably beyond the current technology and must await future space-based missions, the astronomers admit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first of these ''exoplanets'' discovered, in 1996, was at 55 Cancri. The outermost and heaviest planet in the system, which is four times as massive as Jupiter, circles at a distance of 500 million miles, slightly farther than Jupiter in our own system, and takes 14 years to complete an orbit. Because the astronomers have to see a complete cycle before they know a planet is there, its presence was confirmed only in 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star's three innermost planets all circle more tightly than Mercury at distances of 22 million to 3.5 million miles. The closest is also the smallest, only 18 as massive as Earth and surely permanently scorched.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet basks in the lukewarm light of its star from a distance of around 70 million miles, taking 260 days to complete one orbit. Although too massive for life itself, Dr. Marcy said, the planet could harbor rocky moons, just as Saturn and Neptune in our own solar system do, and these would be warmed to the same lukewarm temperatures as Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moons would have to be as massive as Mars, however, in order to keep their water from escaping into empty space. Dr. Marcy said, ''All bets are off on what evolutionary biology would be like on one of these moons.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DIAGRAM: A NEW EXOPLANET: A fifth planet has been discovered orbiting 55 Cancri, a star 41 light-years away in the constellation Cancer.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov. 7 -- The shuttle Discovery glided to a safe landing here Wednesday, bringing to a close an eventful mission that combined challenging space station construction and emergency repairs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle flew over North America from the northwest to the southeast and touched down on the 15,000-foot landing strip at the Kennedy Space Center shortly after 1 p.m. It could be seen passing high above the landing site as a speedy white dot, its distinctive double sonic ba-BOOM sounding moments after it passed overhead, having traveled more than 6.2 million miles since it roared off the launching pad on Oct. 23.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission started out as a pivotal moment in construction of the International Space Station, tightly packed with goals that included delivering a new room -- the Harmony module -- and relocating an enormous solar array and truss from its temporary position atop the station to its permanent location on the left side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving the 35,000-pound array required two spacewalks and a nimble handoff between the robotic arms of the shuttle and the station. Along with those spacewalks and one to prepare the Harmony's external fittings, the mission also called for a fourth spacewalk in which astronauts would test repair techniques for the shuttle's delicate thermal tiles, and a fifth to begin preparing the station for the December visit of the shuttle Atlantis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first three spacewalks went smoothly, and the truss was moved successfully. But two problems caused mission managers to change their plans for the remainder of the mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first was a problem with a rotary joint that keeps the right-side arrays facing the sun. Engineers had noticed that the joint was vibrating oddly and using too much power; during the second spacewalk, on Oct. 28, Daniel M. Tani removed a cover from the joint and found that it was fouled with metal shavings, suggesting that some part of the joint was grinding itself down. The joint will be repaired next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then on Oct. 30, as astronauts inside the station opened the newly relocated solar array, a guide wire snagged on one of the folding panels' hinges and tore two holes in a 110-foot-long ''wing'' of the array. Plans for the remaining spacewalks were shelved to take on a high-stakes, high-risk effort to repair the torn array.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, Scott E. Parazynski rode the station robotic arm, extended with a sensor boom from the shuttle, to reach the array, snip the errant wires and apply five ''cufflinks'' that took the strain off of the material around the tears and allowed the damaged array to be fully extended.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's seven astronauts were Pamela A. Melroy, the commander, who is a retired colonel in the Air Force; the pilot, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marine Corps; Dr. Parazynski; Stephanie D. Wilson; Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army; Paolo A. Nespoli, an Italian representing the European Space Agency; and Mr. Tani, who flew up with the crew and remained aboard the station. The shuttle brought Clayton C. Anderson back to Earth on his 15th wedding anniversary; he had lived and worked aboard the station since June.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews from space on Tuesday, Mr. Anderson said he expected that readjustment to gravity might be a little rough.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an evening news conference, Ms. Melroy said the mission felt like hitting ''a triple home run'' with its dual construction tasks and the round-the-clock effort to come up with a fix for the solar array. ''What you saw is who we are at NASA,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of this mission sets off a scramble aboard the space station to prepare for the next shuttle visit, with three spacewalks planned by the three-member station crew so that the orbiting outpost would be ready for a new laboratory module, known as Columbus, that will be brought up by the Atlantis on a mission that may begin as early as Dec. 6.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference after the landing, NASA's administrator, Michael Griffin, said it was hard for most people to appreciate the difficulty and the accomplishments of the work going on in orbit far above their heads.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think -- and I don't say this lightly -- I think that building the space station is far more difficult and certainly far more complex than was executing Apollo,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''What's happening here is extraordinary. And it's way beyond anything that has ever been done by human beings before, anywhere.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Difficulties like the solar array problem are to be expected, he said, but can't be predicted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't change the brake pads on my car without encountering any problems,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''Part of learning how to live and work in space is learning how to identify and deal with those problems when they do occur.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts and their support team on the ground performed admirably under difficult conditions on an unusually busy and lengthy mission that ended with a smooth landing yesterday. Their accomplishments were a testimonial to the ingenuity of NASA -- and a warning of how precarious the nation's space ventures can become when unexpected glitches develop far from the nearest repair shop.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-day mission to enlarge the international space station now circling overhead was scheduled to be arduous from the start. The prime tasks were to add a new closet-size ''room'' that will allow new laboratories to be attached on future flights and to move large solar arrays that provide power to the station. Those two tasks alone constituted the most challenging construction job ever undertaken in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission became even more difficult when two unexpected snags developed in the solar power arrays. First, a rotary joint that turns one set of solar power wings toward the sun vibrated oddly and was found to be fouled with steel shavings. Before astronauts had time to inspect that problem closely, an even more alarming mishap occurred on another solar array that had just been moved to a new location. As a sheet of solar panels was being unfurled, it snagged on wires and tore in two places, making it impossible to deploy the array fully. That threatened to reduce the power supply enough to constrain further assembly of the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fix turned out to be rudimentary but effective. On a dangerous and difficult space walk, lasting more than seven hours, an astronaut was able to reach the damaged area by riding a robotic arm a long distance from safe haven. He cut the tangled wires and inserted some wire-and-metal sutures -- made from materials on the shuttle following instructions from the ground -- to prevent the tear from widening.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an impressive feat of improvisation that kept plans for completing the station on schedule. Yet the patchwork repair was a reminder that space ventures can encounter problems that threaten a mission -- and that the stakes will rise as humans try to plant outposts on the Moon and on Mars.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14 -- China's success in shooting down one of its own satellites last January has given new energy to efforts in the United States to develop and launch more -- and cheaper -- satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significantly, the new approach to satellites is getting a boost not just from giant aerospace corporations but from small, entrepreneurial companies. Entrepreneurs have also been behind other recent efforts to move ahead in space, including the Ansari X Prize, the $10 million competition that put a pilot in space without government financing in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The efforts of the entrepreneurs are also seen as crucial to keeping the United States at the forefront of space technology as Russia, Europe and increasingly China become more technically adept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The world is moving to new uses of space, and our technology in the United States has not progressed because of the time and expense it takes us to do a mission,'' said Robert Conger, vice president of Microcosm Inc., a small company that is working to perfect a low-cost launching vehicle at its factory in Hawthorne, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making launchings cheaper and quicker would benefit both the military and National Aeronautics and Space Administration because critical satellites could easily be replaced if damaged. And, proponents say, such launchings could unleash a spate of educational, commercial and scientific uses of space that are not being pursued because of expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not even counting the cost of a satellite itself, most space launchings now cost $30 million to $100 million. The private companies aim to reduce those costs to $4.6 million to $7 million, and one specialized space mission company is under contract to launch two satellites at a cost of $11.5 million apiece. Because of the costs and lengthy preparations for a launch, there were just 22 successful government and commercial launchings in the United States in 2006. Russia, France and other countries put 40 satellites into orbit last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Wertz, who teaches astronautics at government space agencies in the United States, Canada and Europe and has written basic textbooks on space mission design and costs, is among those arguing that many more satellites could be launched each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look at it this way,'' said Mr. Wertz, who is also president of Microcosm. ''If we could have launched a satellite within 20 hours of the Asian tsunami in 2004, we could have found villages needing help right away rather than a week or two later. We could have saved more lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wertz founded Microcosm in 1984 to conduct research for the Air Force and to specialize in reducing the cost of space missions. The company, which has 40 employees, is working under contract with the Air Force to develop a rocket that can put a satellite weighing less than 800 pounds in orbit, with eight hours' notice, for $4.6 million. The rocket and fuel assembly -- the launching vehicle -- will cost $3.9 million of that total, Mr. Conger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prime difficulty in the process, Mr. Conger said, is designing a fuel tank and pump assembly that can hold liquid oxygen under great pressure and push fuel out fast enough to attain a speed of 4.7 miles a second to achieve orbit, while being light enough to hold down costs. Microcosm engineers, he said, are using composite materials for the fuel tanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company in the same pursuit of low-cost rocketry, but more advanced because it has a major investment from its founder, is Space Exploration Technologies, which calls itself SpaceX. Also based in Hawthorne, it is trying to create an array of rockets, ranging from a low-price Falcon 1, for light satellite payloads, to a Falcon 9, which the company hopes will be able to deliver cargo to the International Space Station in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who started Zip2, a software company, in 1995 and sold it in 1999 for $307 million. He then founded PayPal, the electronic payment system, which went public and was sold to <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for $1.5 billion in 2002. Mr. Musk, now 36, then began SpaceX. So far, ''I've invested $100 million in the company,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two test firings of the Falcon 1 have failed to reach orbit, but in the second attempt the rocket's propulsion system worked as planned, Mr. Musk said. A third launch is scheduled for January. The launching vehicle's cost will be $7 million, Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SpaceX, which has 330 employees, also has a $278 million contract from NASA to demonstrate the Falcon 9 rocket and a spaceship, with the goal of carrying cargo in 2009 to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can do any payload for one-half to one-third the price of larger competitors,'' Mr. Musk said, referring to <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, <span class="companylink">Arianespace</span> of France, ISC Kosmotras and Dnepr space launching system of Russia and the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main competitor for the entrepreneurial upstarts is <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span>, which was founded in 1982 to develop smaller, less expensive space and rocket systems. Orbital, based in Dulles, Va., has 3,300 employees and has had 24 successful launch missions over the last 12 years for its Pegasus system, which sends payloads into orbit on the back of an L-1011 jetliner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of a mission is roughly $30 million. But Orbital -- which gets about $63 million of its $1.05 billion in annual revenue from the launch vehicle business and the balance from missile and satellite development for the military and NASA -- also has a lower-cost launching vehicle named Minotaur 1. That vehicle is putting two satellites in orbit for the Air Force at an average cost of $11.5 million each. Government-supplied rocket engines help hold down costs for the Minotaur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the capability and reliability,'' said Barron S. Beneski, vice president for investor relations for Orbital. ''And reliability doesn't come cheap.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure to make lower-cost, more frequent space launches is real, Mr. Conger of Microcosm said. ''Our economy is dependent on satellites these days. Think of credit card verification, flows of information on the Internet, global positioning for navigation,'' he said. And the more important challenge is global competitiveness, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs say satellites could do many more things if launching them could be made more affordable. ''Satellites can track not only velocity but the direction of winds over large areas, so we'll be able to know well in advance where a hurricane is going -- enormously helpful for reducing property damage,'' Mr. Wertz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, he and Mr. Conger projected a wide variety of uses for future space missions, from education to specialized manufacturing at zero gravity to soil analysis and surveys of water availability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Wertz said he was concerned about continued financing for the cheaper rockets. The company's total investment over more than eight years in the program, which it calls Scorpius Low-Cost Launch Services, is now $65 million from government and $15 million from the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got $40 million to go,'' Mr. Wertz said, ''and these are challenging times.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, Nov. 16 -- Even as the shuttle Discovery touched down at the Kennedy Space Center last week, the shuttle Atlantis was being readied for a mission to take up another new module to the International Space Station as early as Dec. 6.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the launching will happen on time depends largely on what the station's commander, Peggy Whitson, the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and the American astronaut Daniel M. Tani get done in a nonstop series of tasks inside and outside the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in the midst of a very dynamic and exciting -- but also very challenging -- stage,'' said Kenneth O. Todd, a manager of the space station program, in a briefing with reporters here on Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts' work began with a successful spacewalk on Nov. 9, and includes two more spacewalks, scheduled for Nov. 20 and 24. The pace will not let up, even on Thanksgiving, as the astronauts perform a series of moves to prepare the station for the arrival of Atlantis and the European-made Columbus module.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series of on-orbit tasks is so complex that Rob Navias, a mission commentator, has called it a ''modular shell game.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the astronauts have removed the shuttle docking port from the current position at the end of the Destiny module and placed it on the end of the new Harmony module, which had been put in a temporary position as part of the last shuttle mission. Harmony was then moved to the end of the Destiny module, and now can serve as the docking station and a connection point for Columbus and a Japanese laboratory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are fortunate that things have been going well for us,'' said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the manager of the shuttle program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The additional spacewalks will be devoted to connecting the station's power and cooling systems to the new module. Mission managers still are not sure that everything will be done in time for a Dec. 6 launching, but seem increasingly optimistic thanks to Commander Whitson and her crew, who have shown a determination to work ahead of the demanding schedule set for them and leave mission controllers on the ground struggling to match their pace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to put our sneakers on every day'' to keep up with them, Mr. Todd said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has yet to resolve a serious problem that has emerged in recent months with one of the enormous rotary joints that helps solar panels to face the sun. The joint on the right side of the station is damaged, and an inspection during the last mission showed that the mechanism was peppered with metal shavings. The joint cannot be used until the problem is analyzed and fixed, and that cannot take place until next year, when replacement parts can be flown up and a plan of action devised.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the added power that the rotary joint helps the solar panels to draw, the station will not be able to support the power needs of the fully completed station -- though it is not yet clear at what point that would become critical. A mission in February to bring up the first of two Japanese science modules could be the last before the power needs become acute.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still doing the analysis and sharpening our pencil,'' Mr. Todd said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 -- When the space shuttle fleet is retired in 2010, the United States will be dependent on an increasingly hostile Russia for five years to give American astronauts access to the International Space Station, lawmakers and NASA officials said Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who leads the Senate subcommittee on space, which oversees the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said he was concerned about the gap before the launching of the shuttle's replacement, the Orion crew vehicle, in 2015.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This gap gives Americans no independent access to the $60 billion space station that they are largely paying for, he told a subcommittee hearing. It also gives Russia, whose leader, Vladimir V. Putin, is increasingly challenging American interests, greater influence over the joint project.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, agreed with Mr. Nelson and asked what the reaction would be if a deepening chill in relations between the nations were to bar American access to space. ''The American people will wake up and say, 'What happened?''' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said that he, too, did not care for the plan but that it was the best alternative the United States had, given a NASA budget constrained by tight federal spending and the need to use shuttle money to develop Orion and its launching vehicle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't like it,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''I consider it unseemly in the extreme and unwise strategically for the United States to be dependent on any other nation.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orion is scheduled to make its first flight with a crew in March 2015, he said. That could be moved up to as early as September 2013, he said, if the project received more money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawmakers said they were not optimistic about the acquiring of more money, however. Ms. Hutchison said that she, Mr. Nelson and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, had introduced a measure to provide an additional $1 billion, but that the proposal was not gathering support.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VON BRAUN   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Michael J. Neufeld.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 587 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wernher von Braun was a giant of the 20th century. But what, in the modern imagination, did he represent? Visionary science? Cynical manipulation? The marriage of science and technology? The convergence of war and peace? Was von Braun the Columbus of space? The brains of the military-industrial complex? The face of modernity? Was he a war criminal, as many of his contemporaries believed? Or was he, as Michael J. Neufeld argues in ''Von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War,'' a modern Faust, in league with the devil?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neufeld's thoroughly satisfying biography confirms the broad outlines of its subject's life as they have been known for many years. Born to aristocratic parents in 1912, von Braun told his mother when he was about 10 that he wanted his life to ''turn the wheel of progress.'' A precocious child, he discovered rocketry and spaceflight in his teens and committed himself to putting men (including himself) on the Moon. Even before Hitler came to power, an officer in the German Army selected von Braun from among the membership of the Society for Space Travel, an amateur rocket group, to pursue the possible military applications of this new technology. The army sponsored von Braun's doctoral studies in physics and engineering and promptly classified and confiscated his dissertation, completed in 1934, when he was just 22.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the ensuing decade von Braun worked on multiple rocket programs for Hitler's Germany, including the ballistic missile designated by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry as Vengeance Weapon 2, or V-2. In the last days of the war, von Braun and his closest aides buried their records in a mine shaft and fled west, away from the approaching Soviet Army, to surrender to the Americans. Brought to the United States as part of Project Paperclip, von Braun and his colleagues shared with the Americans what they knew about ballistic missiles. Most found places for themselves in the emerging United States Army missile program, eventually becoming citizens and pillars of the cold war arms race.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through all this military activity, von Braun never lost his passion for spaceflight. He desperately wanted the Jupiter intercontinental ballistic missile that he developed at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Ala., to be the first rocket to place a man-made satellite into orbit, but the Eisenhower administration refused to launch an instrument that would raise the thorny question of overflight of Soviet territory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Soviet satellite Sputnik was launched on Oct. 4, 1957, the space race was on. Von Braun and his rocket team were soon transferred to the new civilian space agency, NASA, to build the rocket that would carry humans to the Moon. The resulting Saturn launch vehicle, still the most powerful ever to leave Earth, powered the Apollo program to the fulfillment of von Braun's dream.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did not, however, take the route he had recommended. Instead of building a large space station in Earth orbit as a way-station to the Moon, NASA flew directly from Earth orbit to lunar orbit. When the Apollo program ended prematurely in the early 1970s, von Braun and his fellow travelers had been unable to build the infrastructure in space that they had envisioned. Disillusioned, von Braun left NASA to take a high-paying position in the aerospace industry, only to have his life cut short by cancer in 1977, at age 65.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Von Braun has been the subject of at least nine previous English-language biographies. But Neufeld's version, exhaustively researched in German and American archives and written in clear, fast-paced prose, offers the most complete, fully documented and critical account that the imperfect documentary record is likely to yield. Neufeld acclaims him ''the most influential rocket engineer and spaceflight advocate of the 20th century.'' This book amply supports that judgment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though most previous biographies have been hagiographic celebrations, some have noted his association with -- if not his commission of -- war crimes in Hitler's Germany. Neufeld also sees him as a modern-day Faust, whose power came from a bargain with the devil. The devil in Neufeld's analogy is Nazi Germany in general and Hitler in particular, from whom von Braun personally received the cherished title of ''Professor.'' Neufeld scours the historical record for evidence of von Braun's crimes, rehearsing his membership in the SS, his development of deadly weapons and, most important, his participation in the notorious slave labor program that built his V-2s at a horrible human cost.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neufeld finds no smoking gun, no evidence that von Braun actively planned or even oversaw the crimes perpetrated on his workers, but he does believe that von Braun's participation in the planning and operation of the Mittelwerk, the underground rocket factory manned by slave laborers from the adjacent Dora concentration camp, would make him guilty of crimes against humanity. And he demonstrates that von Braun covered up his past by dissembling and flat-out lying when confronted with the record. If not guilty of crimes against humanity, von Braun was certainly morally obtuse. Only in the summer of 1944, when the war was clearly lost, he later recalled, did there dawn on him ''the realization that I might be aiding an evil regime.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neufeld is less attentive to the moral guilt of American leaders and institutions. Many of them aided and abetted the suppression and misrepresentation of von Braun's history, as well as the histories of many others in Project Paperclip. In the heat of the cold war, they, too, subordinated their moral principles to what they saw as higher purposes. As the physicist Herbert York later said: ''Some people regard von Braun's unwavering dedication to the grand dream of space flight as heroic and farsighted. Others cannot overlook the grotesque means and unprincipled behavior he used to realize his dreams. I am among the latter, but in this instance I was glad to exploit his willingness to go, without argument, wherever the money was.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Von Braun may have been, as the satirist Tom Lehrer said, ''a man whose allegiance is ruled by expedience,'' but his keepers behaved expediently as well. To paraphrase Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox's judgment on the Pentagon in ''The Imperial Animal'' (1971), if you have a von Braun, you will use him, and he will use you.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERHAPS the rocket baron's most lasting legacy is his vision for space travel. In the 1950s, at the height of his popularity, von Braun used public appearances, Collier's magazine and  <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> television productions to sell the public an idealized model of mankind's future in space. His launching vehicles would be used to build a space station in Earth orbit from which humans would fly to the Moon and then to Mars. Von Braun actually cared more for the Moon mission than for Mars, but he appreciated the romantic appeal of the red planet. That paradigm so captured the imagination of NASA, and the American public, that the United States has been pursuing it ever since.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the NASA administrator Michael Griffin has now declared the space shuttle and the space station mistakes, NASA has vowed to continue with both while beginning to pursue the ''vision for space exploration'' announced by George W. Bush in 2004. That vision is a slightly revised version of the von Braun model, omitting the increasingly troubled and expensive space station. For better or for worse, we remain in the thrall of von Braun's potent imagination.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next time an unexpected comet shows up in the inner solar system, Amy J. Lovell may not get time at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico to observe it before it swings back out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a quarter of its annual budget slashed, to $8 million from $10.5 million, Arecibo will be listening to the universe less often in the coming years. For researchers like Dr. Lovell, a professor of astronomy at Agnes Scott College in Georgia, that may mean her work -- detecting radio waves emitted by ions from busted-up water molecules -- will take years longer to complete.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm prepared to live with that,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More alarming would be the closing of Arecibo in four years, a possibility that has been raised by the National Science Foundation, which pays for the operation of the telescope. ''Then I'm completely up the creek without a paddle,'' Dr. Lovell said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carved in the hilly terrain, a thousand feet wide and 167 feet deep, Arecibo has been listening to radio waves arriving from the cosmos since 1963, and today it remains the world's largest and most sensitive radio telescope. It is also one of the most recognizable, appearing as a backdrop in the movies ''Contact'' and ''GoldenEye.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era of tight and tightening budgets, a review panel for the foundation's astronomy division two years ago looked for places where money could be freed up for new facilities. It recommended a 25 percent cut in Arecibo's foundation financing by 2011 and then another 50 percent cut, to $4 million, in 2011.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said Arecibo should look to other institutions and agencies to make up for the 2011 cut; if it could not find the money, the panel said, the foundation should consider closing it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quarter of its staff was laid off last year. The telescope is now on hiatus for repainting, but when it resumes operation, the number of observing hours will be cut, and nearly half of its receivers will be furloughed. Its emphasis will shift to large, continuing surveys, and smaller projects like Dr. Lovell's may be much more squeezed than in the past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An outcry followed the review panel's decision, particularly from planetary scientists who thought that the group had overlooked Arecibo's role in cataloging potential dangers from asteroids. Its radar can precisely plot the orbit of an asteroid to determine if it could be on course for a collision with Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, scientists and officials testified before a Congressional committee about the asteroid issue and touched on Arecibo's fate. ''The planetary science community is in danger of losing one of its instrumental crown jewels,'' Donald K. Yeomans, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is a candidate to pick up some of the financing, particularly the $1 million to $2 million annual cost of the planetary radar. The agency has contributed to the radar operations in the past, as much as $500,000, but NASA officials say their focus should be on instruments in space, not on the ground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't asked N.S.F. to operate any of our spacecraft,'' said James L. Green, director of NASA's planetary science division.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert L. Brown, director of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center at Cornell University, which runs Arecibo, remains hopeful that Arecibo will stay open.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people at NASA and the people at the N.S.F. are reasonable people whose intentions are good,'' he said. ''Arecibo is caught in the middle.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cornell has also talked to the Puerto Rican government and the University of Puerto Rico. The atmospheric sciences division of the N.S.F. -- Arecibo's radar is used to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere -- may end up contributing to the budget.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something else may also weigh in Arecibo's favor: it may be much cheaper to keep it open. To dismantle the telescope and return the area to a natural state could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other than the hellish heat, a crushing carbon dioxide atmosphere and corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid, Venus is a lot like Earth, scientists said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference at the Paris headquarters of the European Space Agency, the scientists, working on the agency's Venus Express mission, played up the Venus-as-Earth's-twin angle in presenting their newest findings, including signs of lightning, surprising swings of temperature and additional evidence that Venus could have once had oceans the size of Earth's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're really twins which are just separated at birth,'' said Dmitri Titov, the mission's science coordinator. ''The key question is why those twins are so different.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understanding the dynamics and history of Venus's turbulent atmosphere could lead to a better understanding of the role that heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide play in shaping the climate of planets including Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight scientific articles describing the observations of Venus Express, the first spacecraft to visit the planet in more than a decade, appear in today's issue of the journal Nature.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venus is about the same size and mass as Earth, and of roughly the same composition. And before the space age, planetary scientists imagined an Earth-like environment, perhaps even tropical jungles, obscured by Venus's perpetual cloud cover. But in 1958, when astronomers measured intense microwaves emanating from the planet, they first got a hint that it was not as lush as they had imagined.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent visits by spacecraft confirmed that the surface temperatures exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt tin and lead. Although Venus is closer to the Sun than is Earth, the clouds reflect much of the sunlight, and the high temperatures largely result from the heat-trapping effects of an atmosphere that is almost pure carbon dioxide and about 100 times as dense as Earth's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists imagine that Venus formed with much liquid water, just like Earth, but that because it is closer to the Sun, with sunlight twice as intense as on Earth, the water began to evaporate. Water vapor, also a greenhouse gas, trapped heat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That heats up the surface and leads to more evaporation,'' said David Grinspoon of the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science. ''It's a powerful feedback.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evaporation accelerated until all the liquid water had turned into a thick atmosphere of water vapor. As the water molecules floated in the air, scientists hypothesize, ultraviolet rays from the Sun broke them apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Chemical reactions with minerals in the rocks transformed the oxygen into carbon dioxide. The hydrogen, the lightest of atoms, escaped into outer space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measurements from Venus Express, which arrived at the planet last year, support that hypothesis, looking at amounts of hydrogen remaining in the atmosphere compared with concentrations of deuterium, a heavier version of hydrogen. The heavier deuterium would escape more slowly into space, and Venus Express detected a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio 150 times as high as on Earth, a finding that agreed with earlier measurements. What was surprising, though, was that the deuterium concentration turned out to be 2.5 times as high in the upper atmosphere as near the ground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't completely figured out what it means yet,'' Dr. Grinspoon said. ''Once we crack this mystery, this will be an important clue to this overall question of the history of water.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other measurements, Venus Express detected the bursts of radio waves known as ''whistlers,'' which, at least on Earth, are generated by lightning, and also found large temperature swings, up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, between the daytime and nighttime sides of Venus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much thicker atmosphere would have been expected to minimize the temperature differences, said Andrew P. Ingersoll, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology who wrote a commentary in Nature to accompany the scientific papers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ingersoll said he remained skeptical of lightning despite earlier observations by space probes and Earth telescopes. The clouds of Venus are much different from those that produce thunderstorms on Earth. ''They're more like smog in L.A.,'' he said. ''It's really just a haze of sulfuric acid. That kind of cloud, at least on Earth, doesn't produce electrical charge. And thus it's a little puzzling to have lightning.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venus is offering new evidence of onetime oceans that were the size of Earth's. NASA   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 -- The space shuttle Atlantis is to launch on schedule Thursday for a mission to the International Space Station after being cleared by a review of all elements of the flight, NASA managers said Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an all-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, in which engineers reviewed and debated technical issues, managers decided that the shuttle and its seven-member crew could take off on Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., manager of the space shuttle program, said in a televised news conference that there were no technical issues standing in the way of the 11-day mission that will install the European Space Agency's new Columbus laboratory in the growing station. The shuttle has a launch window of Dec. 6 to Dec. 13, Mr. Hale said, and must leave the station by Dec. 23 in order to return home by Christmas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching the Columbus module, which has long been delayed by shuttle program problems, will give Europe a foothold on the station and greatly expand the station's research capability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, the fourth and final shuttle flight to the station this year, will include at least three space walks to link the Columbus module to the Harmony connection module installed last month by a previous shuttle crew, and to remove a large nitrogen tank. In addition, a European Space Agency astronaut, Leopold Eyharts, a French Air Force general, will change places with an American, Daniel M. Tani, as a member of the crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael T. Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager, said officials were not concerned about indications this week that there was an air leak between the United States' Destiny laboratory module and the newly installed Harmony module. Mr. Suffredini said several subsequent tests indicated the initial measurement was incorrect.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said a fourth spacewalk might be added to the mission to have astronauts further check out a huge gear that rotates a set of the station's solar power arrays. On the last shuttle mission, astronauts discovered metallic shavings in the mechanism that caused managers to curtail motion of the solar panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the fourth excursion is approved, Mr. Suffredini said, astronauts would remove most of the thermal coverings over the 10-foot-wide gear, conduct a detailed inspection of the mechanism and bring back more samples of the metal debris for analysis. In addition, he said, they would retrieve one of 12 large bearings that are part of the device so that it can be closely examined for damage, which will help engineers work out a plan to correct the problem.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, concerned that people in the social networking generation have not shown enough interest in its work, has renovated its Web site to appeal more to the 18- to 25-year-old set.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, introduced over the weekend, has new blogs and widgets and more ways for people to view and manipulate content. A MyNASA feature has a ''top playlist'' that lets people watch clips of the space shuttle Discovery's return to Florida or the California wildfires viewed from orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, which has not had major overhaul since early 2003, still has information for policy makers and the media, but also more diversions. It is meant to compete with sites like Space.com (run by a company called Imaginova) and CNN, both of which have had more sophisticated presentations on space exploration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Younger folks look at the Web a different way,'' said Brian Dunbar, Internet services manager for NASA. ''They want to be able to pick and choose.'' He estimates that the NASA site gets about a million unique visitors a month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new features, like better feeds to users of aggregation sites like Digg, were made with young adults in mind.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can prioritize the page however you'd like,'' said Jennifer Robinson, vice president and managing director of Critical Mass, a Web design company that worked on the site with eTouch Systems, a Web technology company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't expect to see a closed community like Facebook springing up on NASA's site. As a government agency, NASA is limited in how much personal information it can gather on users. ''There are privacy concerns about the kind of information we can collect,'' Mr. Dunbar said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Science Times yesterday about a repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope misstated the year of a previous mission. Cmdr. Scott Altman and Michael J. Massimino were on a Hubble mission in 2002, not 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Dec 05 2007    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREENBELT, Md. -- It's the last roundup for the People's Telescope.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next August, after 20 years of hype, disappointment, blunders, triumphs and peerless glittering vistas of space and time, and four years after NASA decided to leave the Hubble Space Telescope to die in orbit, setting off public and Congressional outrage, a group of astronauts will ride to the telescope aboard the space shuttle Atlantis with wrenches in hand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, at least, is the plan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a roller coaster ride from hell,'' Preston Burch, the space telescope's project manager, said in his office here at the Goddard Space Flight Center of the controversy and uncertainty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nearby building, the Hubble's astronaut knights -- dressed as if for surgery, in white gowns, hoods and masks --swarmed through a giant clean room to kick the tires, so to speak, of new instruments destined for the Hubble and to try out techniques and tools under the watchful eye of the Goddard engineers. They practiced sliding a new wide-field camera 3, suspended in air like a magician's grand piano, in and out of its slot on a replica of the telescope that is mechanically and electrically exact down to the tape around the doors.''We have to train their minds and bodies,'' said Michael Weiss, the deputy project manager of Hubble, adding that when the astronauts see the real telescope in orbit, ''they say they've seen it before.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spacewalking astronauts have refurbished the Hubble four times in the last two decades; but the trip planned for August, almost everybody agrees, really will be the last service call. The shuttles are scheduled to stop flying in 2010, and without periodic maintenance, the telescope's gyroscopes and batteries are expected die within about five years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts, engineers and scientists here say they are resolved to pull off the most spectacular rejuvenation of the telescope yet, one, they say, that will leave it operating at the apex of its abilities well into the next decade so that it can go out in a blaze of glory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be a brand new telescope, practically,'' said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute on the Johns Hopkins campus in Baltimore. He added, ''We want to return crackerjack science we can be proud of.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last visit, Dr. Mountain explained, is unique. ''You don't have to do routine maintenance,'' he said. ''It's like a car you're only going to keep another 20,000 miles. You don't buy new tires.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers and project managers are busy mapping out five days of spacewalks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well -- never a given 350 miles above Earth -- the astronauts will install a new camera and spectrograph and change out all the gyroscopes that keep it properly pointed and the batteries that keep it running. They are also planning to repair a broken spectrograph and the Hubble's workhorse, the Advanced Camera for Surveys, which had a severe short-circuit last winter and was pronounced at the time probably beyond repair.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dramatic turnabouts have characterized the history of the Hubble telescope, which was hailed before its launching in April 1990 as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo invented the telescope.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, the Hubble would be able to discern details blurred by the turbulent murky atmosphere. But its 94-inch diameter mirror turned out to have been polished to the wrong shape, leaving it with what astronomers call a spherical aberration. The Hubble became branded as a ''technoturkey.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1993, astronauts fitted the telescope with corrective lenses (at the cost of removing one of its five main instruments, a photometer), and the cosmos snapped into razorlike focus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three more visits by astronauts kept the Hubble running and, by replacing old instruments, actually made it more powerful. Along the way, the astronauts graduated from yanking equipment fitted with large astronaut-friendly handles to operating on instruments never meant to be repaired by people wearing the equivalent of boxing gloves in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, after an infrared camera named Nicmos unexpectedly ran out of coolant, the astronauts attached a mechanical refrigerator to run coolant through its pipes. A year later, the Hubble's astronomers used the rejuvenated camera along with the advanced survey camera to record the deepest telescopic views ever obtained of the universe. The images captured galaxies as they existed a few hundred million years after the beginning of time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have an instrument that reaches so far beyond what you've ever had before, you make discoveries that nobody ever thought of before,'' said John Grunsfeld, who will be the payload commander on the Atlantis mission. ''And we see things that nobody ever saw before. As a result, you know, Hubble became not just an observatory, but an icon for all of science. And Hubble has become part of our culture.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That status did not come cheaply.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Weiler, director of the Goddard center and formerly associate administrator for science at NASA, estimated that over the years the Hubble had cost $9 billion. ''There are few people, especially Americans, who won't say it was worth it,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this seemed doomed to a premature end after the shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003 that killed its crew of seven. Sean O'Keefe, who was then the NASA administrator, declared that a shuttle flight to the telescope was too risky because, unlike the space station, it offered no safe haven if anything went wrong with the shuttle. The public was appalled. Schoolchildren even offered to send their pennies to NASA to keep the telescope going.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers and engineers challenged the reasoning of Mr. O'Keefe, whose background was in public administration, and not engineering. Others in the space science community, noting that the science budget was being squeezed by President Bush's Moon-Mars initiative, suggested that it was time to move on and that the Hubble repair money might be better spent on other science projects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody could see where he was coming from,'' David Leckrone of Goddard, the Hubble's project scientist, said, referring to Mr. O'Keefe's distress about the Columbia and a mandate for increased emphasis on safety. But, he added, ''It seemed so un-NASA-like. We would never have sent anybody to the Moon if we were so risk averse.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought we were dead,'' Dr. Leckrone said. ''As long as he was administrator, it stuck.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2005, however, Mr. O'Keefe resigned to become chancellor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. His successor, Michael Griffin, who has a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering, instituted a rigorous risk analysis, culminating in a two-day meeting of experts that concluded it was no riskier to fly to the telescope than to go to the space station. In fall 2006, after the shuttles had begun flying again, Dr. Griffin approved the Hubble mission to a standing ovation from scientists and engineers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all agree the risks are acceptable,'' Dr. Leckrone said. ''Griffin led us through that process with a good deal of intellectual vigor. He didn't fake it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a backup, NASA will have the shuttle Endeavor, which is scheduled for a September mission to the space station, prepped for a quick launching if a rescue is needed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, engineers, challenged by Mr. O'Keefe to keep the Hubble going as long as possible, learned to run it on a kind of austerity program, using two gyroscopes to keep the telescope pointed instead of the usual three (one for each dimension in space). They also learned how to preserve the batteries, which derive power from solar panels in the sunlitpart of each orbit and provide electricity in the dark part. As a result, the batteries, which degraded rapidly for years, are now actually slightly stronger than before, the engineers say, and the Hubble has a healthy gyroscope in reserve in case one fails.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it weren't for two-gyro science,'' Mr. Weiss, the deputy project manager, said, ''the next gyro failure would take us out of science.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Dr. Grunsfeld, who has been to Hubble twice, the crew includes Cmdr. Scott Altman, who led a Hubble mission in 2003; the pilot, Gregory Johnson; and the mission specialists, Andrew J. Feustel, Megan McArthur, Col. Mike T. Good and Michael J. Massimino, who also worked on the Hubble in 2003 and performed two spacewalks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new wide-field camera was designed to extend the Hubble's vision into the ultraviolet wavelengths characteristic of the hottest stars and into the longer infrared wavelengths characteristic of cool stars, complementing the abilities of the advanced survey camera. It will replace the wide-field planetary camera 2, which has been in the telescope since 1993 and has been its only visible-light camera for the last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the old camera is slid out, perhaps as early as the first spacewalk, will be ''a heart-stopping moment,'' Dr. Mountain said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld's crew will install another new instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, into the slot now occupied by an old corrective optics package known as Costar that is no longer needed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instruments installed on the Hubble since the 1993 repair were built taking the mirror's aberration into account. The new spectrograph is also designed to be sensitive to invisible ultraviolet light. Astronomers hope to use it to map a so-called ''cosmic web,'' stretching through intergalactic space, in which two-thirds of atoms in the universe are thought to be drifting and hiding.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tasks will be the easier parts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the bigger challenges of the mission will be surgery on the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, which can take pictures of things and break down their light to analyze their composition. The spectrograph had an electrical failure in 2004. To get inside the spectrograph, 111 screws that were never meant to be removed in space have to be unscrewed and kept from floating off. The plan is to clamp a plate over them beforehand and unscrew them through tiny holes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such option exists for the Advanced Camera, the choice for 70 percent of Hubble's prospective users and the chief dark-energy-hunting instrument on or off the planet. It suffered a huge short-circuit in its power supply last winter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a task that could be spread over two spacewalks, the astronauts will clamp a new power supply to the outside of the camera. From there, according to ground tests, power can be fed back inside to the other parts of the camera through existing wires, unless they were damaged in the short-circuit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one additional piece of business, the astronauts will attach a grapple fixture to the bottom of the telescope so that a robot spacecraft could grab it and attach a rocket module in the future. The rocket would then drop the telescope into the ocean.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that time is not yet. The telescope's orbit will be stable through 2024, according to recent calculations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this work could, in principle, be performed in the allotted five days of spacewalks. In that case, when the Atlantis pulls away and human eyes glimpse the Hubble for the last time in person, the telescope would have its full complement of instruments to dissect the light from the cosmos for the first time since 1993.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running down a list of subjects like planets around other stars, dark energy and the structure of the universe, Dr. Leckrone called the telescope a toolkit for discovery. Noting that any astronomer in the world could propose to use it, he said: ''A lot of brain power comes to Hubble. It's mouthwatering to think of what they will do with it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether the astronomers were tempted to run the rejuvenated instrument frugally to prolong its life beyond its anticipated 2013 demise, Dr. Mountain said the idea was to go for broke.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want to trade science for false longevity,'' he said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 4 -- The space shuttle Atlantis is poised for a Thursday launching to the International Space Station on an 11-day mission that will make the orbital outpost more international.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said Tuesday that the Atlantis and its crew of seven were ready for a liftoff at 4:31 p.m. as the space station passes over the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A countdown that began Monday has gone without incident, and the weather forecast is close to ideal, the officials said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle weather officer, Kathy Winters of the 45th Weather Squadron of the Air Force, said at a morning status briefing that there was a 90 percent chance of good weather at launching time. ''We are optimistic about the weather on Thursday,'' Ms. Winters said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principal goal of the mission is to add the European Space Agency's new Columbus laboratory to the growing station. The laboratory, which is 23 feet long and 15 feet in diameter, will significantly increase the station's research capability and give Europeans a major foothold in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching the 22,700-pound, billion-dollar module, built in Italy and outfitted in Germany, has long been delayed by a series of shuttle program problems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is very significant for Europe,'' said Frederic Nordlund, head of the European Space Agency's office in Washington. ''With Columbus, we become co-owners of the International Space Station.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe has been involved in human space flight for decades, flying astronauts and equipment aboard the Russian Mir space station, on numerous space shuttle missions and on missions to the current space station, Mr. Nordlund said. But joining a major piece of hardware to those put into space by Russia and the United States means full partnership, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus will be managed from a new control center built in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and Europeans will be in charge of almost all aspects of the module. In a few weeks, Mr. Nordlund said, Europe will be launching its first unmanned supply vehicle, named the Jules Verne, to the station, further solidifying its role in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis's mission is to be the fourth and final shuttle flight to the station this year. The crew includes Hans Schlegel, a European Space Agency astronaut from Germany who will participate in two of the mission's three planned spacewalks to install Columbus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also aboard is another European astronaut, Gen. Leopold Eyharts of the French Air Force, who will change places with the American astronaut Daniel M. Tani as a member of the station crew. During his tour, General Eyharts is to spend much of his time outfitting Columbus and getting it ready for full operations.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANNAPOLIS, Md., Dec. 3 -- By now, nearly five years after her husband died when the space shuttle Columbia broke apart over Texas just 16 minutes before its scheduled landing at Cape Canaveral, the astronaut's widow has a meticulous list of the things to pack for remembering him in public.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American flag that was draped over his coffin; the flight patch recovered from the shuttle debris in East Texas; the Tolstoy quotation he carried in his wallet, inscribed now over a laminated photograph of the seven-member crew; his T-38 flight helmet; portraits of him in his orange NASA suit; some of his many e-mail messages to her from his 16 days in space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before what she called the final large public memorial here on Sunday for her husband, Cmdr. William C. McCool, 41, the pilot of the shuttle that was lost on Feb. 1, 2003, Lani McCool was frantically making mental checklists: Who has the flag? The white scarf used to cover the flag? A plastic bag to protect the photographs and e-mail messages from the rain? The Columbia mission lapel pins?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This moment had been building for years; it was the last big tribute planned, and she and her three grown sons were tired. Mrs. McCool, who sometimes describes herself to friends as ''the woman in a bubble,'' is reclusive, and the spotlight makes her uneasy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Annapolis service was over, she said, she would finally catalog this mobile collage of his life and her grief and put it into storage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My reason for having so much of Willie's stuff around me still is that it's like an art piece,'' she said. ''But when a date for this was set, I started archiving things -- not exactly cleansing, but it was nice, kind of moving forward.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now, in quiet moments, she can finally turn to the question of what to do at Commander McCool's unmarked grave, a patch of grass in a cemetery in her hometown, Anacortes, Wash.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. McCool, a photographer and artist, regularly visits the grave and adorns it with temporary tributes, including a peace sign made of rose petals and 46 red balloons for his 46th birthday last September.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she got to Annapolis, where Commander McCool's funeral was held in 2003, at the Naval Academy chapel, she said: ''Coming here, it feels like the final burial. I'll pat the dirt, and I can finally be at peace.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's service was held on the cross-country course at the Naval Academy, where Mr. McCool, a midshipman who graduated in 1983, was a runner and team captain. The academy unveiled a seven-foot-high granite marker, with a bronze bas relief of Mr. McCool running on one side and the words ''Sixteen Minutes From Home,'' engraved on the other, near a replica of his flight patch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the foot of the marker, which was financed with private donations, one of Commander McCool's e-mail messages is engraved in a cobblestone: ''I've been reflecting about there being a clue to peace from this vantage point,'' it said. ''The answer is very obvious from here.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the service on Sunday, which drew about 150 people, including NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, Mrs. McCool was able to muster the calm to speak. Her voice broke and she said, ''I'm sorry,'' as she was reading from her husband's e-mail.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, at many of the dozen or so public memorial services and tributes to her husband, the events have felt like a mix between a wedding and a funeral, she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Annapolis service had that feel -- the excitement of touching the flight patch replica on the granite marker, which Mrs. McCool had the artist place at her ''kissing height,'' about five feet. But she also listened to a midshipman play ''Amazing Grace'' on bagpipes to close the service, and wore dark sunglasses, even in the rain, to hide her tears.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A constant for Mrs. McCool at these events is her close friend Rona Ramon, the widow of another astronaut on the Columbia, Col. Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut in space. Mrs. McCool goes to Israel for Colonel Ramon's memorials, and Mrs. Ramon comes to the United States for Commander McCool's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Ramon, who came to Annapolis with two of her four children, said: ''In Hebrew we say there's nothing by coincidence. These two events are so connected; it's been a time to think about peace.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Sunday service was over, Mrs. McCool's son Cameron, 20, said of his mother, ''I feel relief for her; I can always feel the stress in her voice.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before she goes back home this week, Mrs. McCool plans to go to back to the Willie McCool marker alone. She said she would take the shells from the 21-gun salute at his funeral, spread them out around the granite stone and take a photograph for her collection.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By WARREN E. LEARY   </div><div>458 words</div><div>7 December 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>20</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 6 -- NASA officials delayed the launching of the space shuttle Atlantis at least until Saturday after canceling Thursday's attempt because of problems with a pair of fuel sensors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leroy Cain, head of the mission management team, said at an evening news conference that engineers had abandoned the possibility of trying again on Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending more than five hours poring over data about the sensor problem, Mr. Cain said his managers needed more time and would go home ''to sleep on it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Saturday liftoff would occur at 3:43 p.m. However, Air Force weather forecasters said there was only a 60 percent chance of acceptable weather.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technicians were about 80 percent finished with loading 500,000 pounds of propellants into the shuttle's large external fuel tank early Thursday when tests indicated problems with two of four sensors at the base of the liquid hydrogen section. Technicians drained the tank and examined sensor data during the process.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since flight rules require that at least three of the four sensors be working to launch, officials at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida scrubbed the flight for the day and began preparations to try again on Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis and its crew of seven were to blast off at 4:31 p.m. on a mission to deliver a European science laboratory called Columbus to the International Space Station. Weather conditions were close to ideal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, we're a little disappointed in the events today,'' said Doug Lyons, the launch director. ''But we're certainly working to resolve our issues and make an attempt as soon as we possibly can.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cain said subsequent analysis indicated the problem involved an open electrical circuit in the sensor system, and not the sensors themselves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sensors are part of a backup system to ensure that the three main engines cut off at the right time during launching. Premature cutoff in the more than eight-minute dash to space could cause the shuttle to fail to reach orbit, and having the engines keep running once fuel is exhausted could result in a disastrous explosion, experts said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had problems with the fuel sensors on several flights after the Columbia disaster in 2003, when the system went through numerous modifications.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 7 -- NASA officials on Friday again postponed the launching of the space shuttle Atlantis as they continued to discuss how to deal with a fuel sensor problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight, scheduled for Thursday and later pushed to Saturday, is now set for a Sunday liftoff at 3:21 p.m., officials said. But a Sunday launching is not guaranteed, as mission officials plan to meet again Saturday to discuss options that may mean further delays, N. Wayne Hale, the shuttle program director, said Friday night. Mr. Hale called the fuel sensor system ''suspect'' and said thinking is still ''evolving.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one has come forward with a good plan to improve our situation,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Atlantis can launch, he said after six hours of discussions by engineers and technicians, NASA must be convinced that it can work around the fuel gauge problem during the shuttle's 8.5-minute climb into orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis's mission is to carry a European science laboratory called Columbus to the International Space Station. NASA has until Dec. 16 to get the shuttle off before this launching window closes. The next opportunity is in January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Leinbach, launch director at the Kennedy Space Center here, said Atlantis has until Monday to launch before standing down for three days to replenish fuel. After that, the next chance for flight would be Dec. 14.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technicians were loading propellants into the shuttle's external fuel tank on Thursday when tests showed problems with two of four sensors at the base of the liquid hydrogen section of the tank. Flight rules require that at least three of the four sensors are working.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers said analysis indicates the problem does not involve the sensors themselves, and may be caused by an open electrical circuit or another fault in wiring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fuel system sensors assure that the shuttle's three main engines do not cut off too soon or burn too long during launching. Premature cutoff could cause the shuttle to fail to reach orbit and having the engines keep running if fuel is exhausted could result in an explosion, experts said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 8 -- NASA will try to launch the space shuttle Atlantis on Sunday under restrictive rules to deal with problem fuel sensors and an unusually tight liftoff schedule.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight, originally scheduled for Thursday and postponed twice as engineers assessed the sensor issue, was set for liftoff at 3:21 p.m., officials said Saturday. However, if all four sensors in the bottom of the liquid hydrogen propellant fuel tank do not operate properly during fueling, the flight will be scrubbed.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 9 -- NASA on Sunday delayed the launching of the space shuttle Atlantis until at least Jan. 2 to give engineers time to diagnose and fix its balky fuel tank sensors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight, originally scheduled for Thursday and then rescheduled for Sunday, was given its latest postponement when one of four critical sensors in the liquid hydrogen section of the external tank malfunctioned during early morning fueling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said at a news conference that technicians would try to isolate and repair the problem while the Atlantis stayed on its launching pad here at the Kennedy Space Center. If the issue requires a rolling back of the shuttle to its hangar for repairs, the new launching date probably would slip later into January, said LeRoy Cain, head of the mission management team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a lot of options before we determine if we have to roll back,'' Mr. Cain said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Gerstenmaier, director of space flight for the agency, said there was enough margin in next year's plans that a January flight by the Atlantis should not interfere with another shuttle mission scheduled for February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main mission for the Atlantis and its crew of seven is to deliver and install a large European science laboratory on the International Space Station. NASA had until Dec. 14 to see the shuttle off before its last launching window of the year would close.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had hoped to extend the Atlantis's 11-day mission to allow for an extra spacewalk by shuttle astronauts to trouble-shoot a malfunctioning joint that turns a set of solar power panels on the station. Officials have begun looking at the possibility of having the crew aboard the station stage a spacewalk to examine the joint, Mr. Gerstenmaier said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After earlier problems with the sensors, launching officials set stringent standards for a planned Sunday liftoff at 3:21 p.m. Eastern Time. If all the sensors had not acted properly, the flight would have been scrubbed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We gave it a good try today,'' said Doug Lyons, the mission's launching director.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly eight billion miles away, the Voyager 2 spacecraft has passed through a sonic boom of solar wind particles in the outer part of the solar system, NASA scientists said. On Aug. 30, the craft detected the speed of charged particles from the Sun passing it abruptly slowing from 700,000 miles per hour to 350,000 miles per hour. Over the next two days, the spacecraft passed through the boundary four more times as the solar system's ''termination shock'' bubble expanded and contracted. Voyager 2's twin, Voyager 1, passed through the boundary three years ago, in the opposite hemisphere and about a billion miles farther from the Sun. The new data confirm a squashed shape for the magnetic bubble enveloping the solar system, which has been pushed inward in the southern hemisphere. Both spacecraft will eventually exit the solar system, perhaps as soon as 7 to 10 years from now.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will fill the space shuttle Atlantis's fuel tank next week in hopes of cracking a fuel gauge problem that led to back-to-back launching delays, the agency said. The trouble could be anywhere in the 100 feet of wiring between the four gauges at the bottom of the fuel tank and the shuttle itself, in any of the connectors, or even in the sensors themselves, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager. At the same time, engineers will conduct other tests, mostly in laboratories, to try to figure out what is causing the gauges in the Atlantis's tank to malfunction.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- The lame wheel on the NASA Mars rover Spirit has proved an invaluable science tool, turning up evidence of a once habitable environment, scientists said Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have largely unraveled the mystery of geological patterns called ''spiders'' that appear each spring around the south pole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists reported their findings here at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right front wheel of Spirit stopped turning in March 2006. Since then, the rover has been driving backwards, dragging the lame wheel along. This May, scientists noticed a bright spot in the trail of overturned dirt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They turned Spirit around for a closer look, finding high levels of silica, the main ingredient of window glass. They then aimed the rover at a nearby rock, wanting to break it apart to determine if the silica was just a surface coating, or if the rock was silica all the way through.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target rock survived Spirit's charge, but a neighboring rock cracked open. The interior of that rock, which the scientists informally named ''Innocent Bystander,'' turned out to be rich in silica.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, such high concentrations of silica can form in only two places: a hot spring, where the silica is dissolved away and deposited elsewhere, or a fumarole, an environment, often near a volcano, where acidic steam rises through cracks. The acids dissolve other minerals, leaving mostly silica. On Earth, both environments teem with life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirit's twin, Opportunity, which has been exploring a spot on the other side of Mars, has found evidence of an environment once steeped in acidic groundwater. The silica discovery is the first time that Spirit has seen signs of widespread water in its surroundings, a 90-mile-wide impact crater known as Gusev Crater.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gusev was chosen as a landing site, because, at least from orbit, it looks as if it were once a lake with what appears to be river channels flowing away from it. However, until now, the rocks that Spirit has examined have largely been volcanic basalt with little hint of water.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This shows us a side of Mars we haven't seen before, and my guess is that it's more common than we had thought,'' said Steven W. Squyres, the project scientist for the rovers. ''Whichever of those conditions produced it, this concentration of silica is probably the most significant discovery by Spirit for revealing a habitable niche that existed on Mars in the past.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From far above the surface, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been taking a closer look at radial patterns of ''spider'' gullies, as well as bright and dark fan-like features that appear in the Martian landscape each spring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists first spotted the gullies several years ago in images taken by the Mars Global Surveyor. With the much higher resolution of Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists saw for the first time that the gullies were wider at the center of the pattern. Another instrument allowed them to map the images onto the Martian topography; the centers of the spiders were at the top of the small hills. Those two bits of information indicated that the gullies were carved by something flowing uphill -- and that pointed to carbon dioxide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Tuesday, Candice Hansen, deputy principal investigator for the orbiter's high-resolution camera, said it now appeared that a layer of translucent carbon dioxide ice, perhaps half a yard thick, formed over the south polar terrain during the winter months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, sunlight warms the ground, vaporizing carbon dioxide at the base of the ice layer. The gas flows uphill, carving channels in the underlying soil. At weak points in the ice, the gas erupts in small geysers. The release of pressure causes the carbon dioxide gas to freeze solid and fall as white snow -- the white parts of the fan-like patterns. Dust blown out with the carbon dioxide falls on the ground to form the dark parts of the fans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is unlike anything on Earth,'' Dr. Hansen said, though similar patterns have been seen on the Neptunian moon of Triton.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials scrambled this year to decide how to handle the legal and public relations fallout surrounding Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, an astronaut who drove from Texas to Florida to confront a romantic rival, according to e-mail messages released Wednesday by the space agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 222 pages of messages also suggested a still-friendly relationship between Captain Nowak and Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy in the days before Captain Nowak drove to Orlando, where, the authorities say, she spritzed her rival, Capt. Colleen Shipman of the Air Force, in the face with pepper spray.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Shipman, who had been dating Commander Oefelein, had just arrived at the Orlando airport after visiting him in Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Captain Nowak's arrest, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, chief of the astronaut corps, flew to Florida and initially spoke on behalf of the agency. Many of the e-mail messages to Colonel Lindsey included kudos.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Steve, you are handling an incredibly difficult task extremely well,'' wrote Michael Coats, an astronaut who is director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other officials offered tactical suggestions. Carl E. Walz, a retired astronaut helping plan the next generation of space flight, asked whether it would help to take the case through the military courts, which ''might get it out of the media circus.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey responded that the agency was working with military justice officials, but that ''unfortunately, the situation is a lot more complex than that!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The messages were posted online by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in response to Freedom of Information Act requests from many news organizations, including The New York Times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The messages suggest that the agency's public relations effort in the Nowak case was under close internal scrutiny. Eileen Hawley, director of external relations for the Johnson Space Center, sent around a message from an outside public relations professional, characterizing it as praising NASA ''for caring about our family, for neither defending nor protecting her and for acknowledging her professional capabilities.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hawley added, ''If we continue to strike this balance of caring but not taking sides; remaining open; and not making excuses, we'll be well served.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hawley included the professional's message, saying, ''Hats off to NASA,'' for its message control and, ''If you have a crisis and are looking for words to sound good and allow wafel room. ... NASA made it look easy today.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The messages between Captain Nowak and Commander Oefelein were professional and warm, with a hint of flirtation. He asked her advice on the menu for his mission last December, and on Jan. 5, after his return from space but a month before the airport confrontation, he asked whether she would be at a happy-hour celebration of the midpoint of colleagues' stay aboard the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She replied, ''Only if u r!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The messages reflect the banter of friendly colleagues, with her offering to pick up lunch for him and planning get-togethers for running and bike rides.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Commander Oefelein's relationship with Captain Shipman was developing. In late January, Commander Oefelein invited her on a trip his shuttle crew was taking to his home state, Alaska, and said he had been asked about her clothing size for arctic gear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think I can figure that out,'' he wrote. ''Sized sexy and athletic.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wrote that he usually stayed with his parents on such visits, but had asked for a hotel room this time ''due to noise requirements,'' adding, ''We need some 'privacy'!!!!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private messages form an incomplete picture of the intertwined lives of the two astronauts, because NASA did not include messages deemed purely personal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not every e-mail,'' said James Hartsfield, a spokesman for the Johnson Space Center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal comments came through messages related to official astronaut activities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fact was seized on by Captain Nowak's lawyer, Donald A. Lykkebak, who said through a spokeswoman that the messages were ''deceptively incomplete'' and had ''little if anything to do with Lisa Nowak's case.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak and Commander Oefelein have been dropped from the astronaut corps and have returned to duties with the Navy. Her trial on charges of assault and attempted kidnapping is to begin in April.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- American astronauts aboard the International Space Station said Thursday that they would perform an extra spacewalk next week to examine malfunctioning joints that turn a set of solar power panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts -- Peggy A. Whitson, the station commander, and Daniel M. Tani, a flight engineer -- said during a NASA news conference televised from space that they would do the spacewalk, which would have been performed by astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis if it had taken off on schedule last week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission of the shuttle and its crew of seven has been delayed until Jan. 10 so engineers can fix a problem with sensors in its giant fuel tank. The Atlantis is to deliver the Columbus, a science module built in Europe, to the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson and Mr. Tani will do a detailed inspection of the station's starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, or SARJ, while the third station crewman, Col. Yuri I. Malenchenko, a Russian, assists from inside. During their excursion, the astronauts will also inspect a smaller joint that maneuvered a pair of solar panels and suffered an electrical short last week, mission officials said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anticipated six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk will be the 100th time astronauts have ventured outside the station or visiting space shuttles to do construction work on the station. In an inspection last month, astronauts discovered that the big rotary joint that steers a beam to which sets of solar panels are installed was covered in metallic grit or shavings, indicating a destructive grinding process in the mechanism. NASA needs to repair and clean up the joint so that solar panels can track the sun to provide enough power for future station expansion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Shireman, deputy program manager for the station, told a later news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston that the new problem with the smaller joint needed to be addressed even before the big rotary joint was repaired. Engineers believe the small joint may have been hit by space debris or a meteorite, causing it to short out and lose its ability to pivot a set of solar panels to face the sun, Mr. Shireman said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are spare parts on the station to repair some things that might be wrong with the smaller joint, he said no fixes were planned during the coming spacewalk.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In business, repurposing is all the rage. Take a product or service intended for one purpose and have it do something else.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even NASA has caught the repurposing bug. The agency took its Deep Impact spacecraft -- the one that in 2005 sent an 800-pound probe crashing into comet Tempel 1 to understand better the composition of comets -- and gave it a new mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two missions, really. One was to study known extrasolar planets with one of the telescopes on the spacecraft, and the other to fly past a second comet, Boethin, in 2008, and try to characterize it by surveying it with cameras and an infrared spectrometer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since what is now called the Epoxi mission was announced, a problem cropped up. Boethin, which is about a mile in diameter and was discovered in 1975, seems to have disappeared. Astronomers cannot locate it and suggest that it may have broken into pieces to small to be seen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in addition to repurposing Deep Impact, NASA is retargeting it, too. The agency announced last week that it had approved sending the spacecraft to another small comet, Hartley 2. The spacecraft has already performed a course-correcting rocket burn, and it is now scheduled to pass within about 600 miles of the comet in October 2010.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- NASA spent Tuesday troubleshooting problems in space and on the ground, with astronauts examining malfunctioning joints on the International Space Station and engineers testing fuel tank sensors aboard the shuttle Atlantis as it sits on its launching pad.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peggy A. Whitson, the space station commander, and Daniel M. Tani, the flight engineer, performed a 6-hour-56-minute spacewalk in which they inspected two errant joints that turn the station's solar-power panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts made an examination of the large starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, or SARJ, while the third station crewman, Col. Yuri I. Malenchenko of Russia, assisted from inside. The joint, which turns two sets of solar panels for alignment with the sun, has been locked in a stationary position for weeks while engineers try to trace the source of unexpected vibrations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, technicians at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida loaded 500,000 pounds of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the Atlantis's external fuel tank to test malfunctioning fuel gauge sensors that have twice delayed the shuttle's launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the tanking test, which began shortly after dawn, one of four hydrogen sensors that are part of an engine cut-off system failed early and two others worked intermittently. Later in the day, before the tank was drained, one of the erratic sensors also failed, leaving only one working properly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, told a news conference televised from the Johnson Space Center in Houston that special equipment had isolated the problem to a metal and glass connector through which wiring from inside the tank joined with circuits outside the shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today, the sensors themselves were exonerated in these tests,'' Mr. Hale said. ''We know exactly what we've got to work on now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said engineers did not know what caused the connector to malfunction when the system was exposed to cold hydrogen or if the problem could be repaired at the launching pad instead of rolling the shuttle back to its hangar. Engineers will take a few days to assess the information, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the problem can be fixed while the shuttle is on the launching pad, NASA hopes to launch the Atlantis on Jan. 10 to carry the European science laboratory Columbus to the space station. Launching plans on Dec. 6 and Dec. 9 were canceled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalking astronauts first examined a smaller joint on the station's right side that maneuvers a pair of solar panels. On Dec. 8, that joint, which keeps the panels pointed at the sun, had an electrical short that officials suspected was caused by space debris or a meteorite. The astronauts found no evidence of that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At another news conference from the Johnson Space Center, Ginger Kerrick, the station spacewalk director, said the problem appeared to be inside the rotary mechanism of the joint. A replacement for the suspected part is aboard the station, and managers said they might have spacewalking astronauts substitute it early next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two previous inspections, astronauts discovered that the larger rotary joint that steers a beam to which sets of solar panels are installed is covered in metallic grit or shavings, indicating a destructive grinding process in the mechanism. NASA needs to repair and clean up the joint so that solar panels can track the sun to provide enough power for future station expansion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson and Mr. Tani removed several panels covering the big rotary joint to photograph and inspect the mechanisms underneath.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's spacewalk was the 100th time astronauts have ventured out from the station or visiting space shuttles to do construction or maintenance work. With her fifth spacewalk giving her 32 hours and 36 minutes outside, Dr. Whitson established a record for female astronauts, causing mission control to call her the queen of spacewalking.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The mother of a veteran NASA astronaut who is now on board the International Space Station died Wednesday when her car was struck by a freight train in a Chicago suburb, the police said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose Tani, 90, the mother of the astronaut Daniel M. Tani, was pronounced dead at a Lombard, Ill., hospital after the accident, the police said in a statement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnson Space Center in Houston had no immediate comment on when and how Mr. Tani had been informed of the death.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tani, 46, arrived at the space station on Oct. 25 aboard the shuttle Discovery for a two-month tour. But the stay has been extended because of problems launching another shuttle.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- NASA has delayed the launching of a mission to Mars by two years, to 2013, because of an undisclosed conflict of interest involved in one of two final proposals, officials said Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postponing the Mars Scout program mission means that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will miss an opportunity to launch a flight to Mars for the first time in more than a decade, Doug McCuistion, director of the agency's Mars Exploration Program, said at a news conference.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars and Earth only get close enough to efficiently launch explorations every 26 months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reducing 26 mission proposals to two, and entering an evaluation period this fall to select a winner, Mr. McCuistion said an unspecified conflict of interest arose concerning one proposal and the assessment group.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resolving the conflict, the nature of which Mr. McCuistion said he could not discuss, required disbanding the review panel and forming a new one. This process, he said, in setting back a selection by at least four months, meant that keeping to the original launching date would put undue cost and schedule pressure on the winner.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Delaying the next Scout mission is allowing the mission planning teams to re-plan their proposed missions,'' he said. ''It will also reduce the risk of cost overruns driven by the tight mission schedule.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teams, one at the University of Colorado and the other from the  <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> branch in Boulder, Colo., have until August 2008 to submit their new proposals. NASA will make a final selection next December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both groups are proposing similar spacecraft to orbit Mars and study why the planet's thin atmosphere is escaping into space. The five-year, $475 million mission is part of the Scout program to send missions with relatively modest costs to regularly explore Mars. Mr. McCuistion said the delay could add as much as $40 million to the cost of the mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other news concerning Mars, NASA said Friday that a recently discovered asteroid that appeared on course to hit the planet would probably pass it within 30,000 miles. The asteroid, estimated to be about 164 feet wide and named 2007 WD5, should zoom by about 6 a.m. on Jan. 30, 2008, the announcement said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainties about the asteroid's orbit gives it a 1-in-75 chance of hitting Mars, scientists said. If it were to hit, it would strike at about 30,000 miles per hour and create a crater more than a half-mile wide.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minister of defense caused a media squall after joking about invasions by space aliens and movie monsters. Responding to a question at a news conference, the minister, Shigeru Ishiba, told reporters that he was studying whether the nation's pacifist Constitution would limit a military response to an attack by space aliens. ''There are no grounds to deny that there are unidentified flying objects and some life forms that control them,'' Mr. Ishiba said, smiling at first, but then delivering a straight-faced explanation. ''If Godzilla attacked, that would probably be a natural disaster relief operation,'' making military action legally permissible, he said. The comments came days after Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Nobutaka Machimura, who is the government's top spokesman, professed belief in U.F.O.'s.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- In Washington, it almost seems radical -- completing government projects at their original budgeted cost.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at NASA, the new director of the space science division appears to be making headway at doing just that, creating some anguish among researchers and contractors along the way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his eight months on the job, the director, S. Alan Stern, has turned back almost a half-dozen requests for more money from projects experiencing cost overruns, he said. That has forced mission leaders to trim parts of their projects, streamline procedures or find other sources of financing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern, an astrophysicist and planetary scientist, became associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in April. In an appearance before Congress the next month, he outlined a tough plan for keeping missions on budget and holding leaders responsible: better cost-estimating tools to more realistically price missions, more experience for scientists running projects, and new studies to better understand and reduce technology risks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA devotes about $5.4 billion a year to its science program, divided among specialties like astrophysics, earth science and planetary exploration. To finance President Bush's exploration initiative to return humans to the Moon, while also financing space shuttle operations and a shuttle replacement out of the agency's approximately $16 billion annual budget, science program money is being held to about a 1 percent increase per year for four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factoring in inflation and the loss of what had been anticipated financing increases, space experts say this amounts to a loss for NASA science of about $3 billion over that period. For Dr. Stern, that means doing more with less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first targets in his effort to attack cost overruns was the Kepler mission, a project started in 2001 to launch a planet-hunting telescope. Because of management problems, technical issues and other difficulties, the price tag went up and the launching date slipped from the original 2006 target.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, NASA resolved itself to a 20 percent cost overrun, which raised the price to $550 million, and accepted a 2008 launching time. Then the Kepler team came to Dr. Stern last spring with a request for an additional $42 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Four times they came for more money and four times we told them 'no,''' Dr. Stern said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Dr. Stern's team threatened to open the project to new bids so other researchers could take it over using the equipment that had already been built, the Kepler group came up with a solution. Among other measures, the duration of the four-year mission was cut by six months and preflight testing was scaled back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When they came to believe I was serious and had my boss's backing,'' Dr. Stern said, ''they took it seriously. They quickly found a way to erase that bill.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern, 50, came to NASA from the  <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., where he directed the Space Science and Engineering Division. His hard line on cost overruns has been one of the first signs of change noticed by researchers and many outsiders. So far, he said, his team has rolled back cost overruns in almost a half-dozen projects, sending out word that this is now standard procedure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I admire what he's doing,'' said Dr. Lennard A. Fisk, professor of space science at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Space Studies Board at the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Fisk, who headed NASA's science directorate in the 1980s, said true reform required a cultural change at the agency in how it runs programs. And a director must be consistent, he said, to convince people of the seriousness of the effort.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the beginning, he has to be hard-nosed with everybody,'' Dr. Fisk said. ''The first one he blinks on could be a problem. He has to maintain his credibility.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern said that when he took the job, he told the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, that he planned personnel and policy changes in his division to make the most of a stagnant budget while continuing to sponsor world-leading space science. He noted the appointment of Dr. John C. Mather, a Nobel laureate, to the vacant post of chief scientist in the directorate as a sign that science, not just launching spacecraft, would be the chief focus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're just not walking around swinging the ax,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We have a very new team that, I hope, is changing the way we do business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern said he did not blame individual managers or the NASA field centers responsible for some projects for all of the overrun problems. For years, costs have not been as tightly controlled as possible, starting with unrealistic estimates of how much it would take to complete a project, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last five years, he said, continuing projects have come back to NASA asking for $5.4 billion in new money. Although a few projects were canceled, the agency found extra money in some cases by borrowing from other programs or delaying future initiatives.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, we sacrificed the future for the present,'' Dr. Stern said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the agency made cost control more difficult by changing mission requirements during development or modifying launching dates, Dr. Stern said. It became routine for project managers to come back to NASA headquarters for more money when there were problems, he said, and often, they got it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With today's tight budgets, he said, it is unfair to expect NASA to raid other programs or stop initiating programs to pay for the excessive costs of current projects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mission that makes the mess is responsible for cleaning it up,'' Dr. Stern said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged that NASA shared responsibility for some problems, noting that ''the blame goes all around.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency needs to change the way it does business, he said, in part by avoiding the tendency to micromanage projects and by doing a better job of picking more experienced people to lead programs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The person at the helm should not be a rookie,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern's new push scored what he called one of its biggest victories when cost overruns threatened a flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory. The $1.7 billion project is to launch a nuclear-powered, wheeled robot laboratory to Mars in late 2009, a craft three times larger than the Spirit and Opportunity rovers now operating there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a review last summer showed a $75 million cost overrun, Dr. Stern's office scaled back some of the laboratory's capabilities. That included eliminating a camera to take images of its descent to landing and stopping work on a laser chemistry instrument called Chem-Cam, developed by researchers in the United States and France, that would burn off surface coatings of materials to determine their composition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move stirred an uproar among scientists, and the Planetary Society space advocacy group mounted a public campaign against it, calling for a Congressional review of the decision. In November, Dr. Stern announced that Chem-Cam and the descent imager were back on the laboratory manifest. The descent camera's designer and maker offered to finish the instrument at its own expense, he said, and the Chem-Cam team got more money from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a main sponsor, and its French partners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a win-win situation,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We got a lot of the cost reduction we wanted, and their instruments get to fly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Roger C. Wiens at Los Alamos, the principal investigator on Chem-Cam, said he had delivered several spacecraft instruments for past projects, but his latest dealings with NASA headquarters were unique.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I haven't experienced this in the past,'' Dr. Wiens said. ''We were surprised to be taken off the mission and are very glad to be back on.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wiens said everyone working on Chem-Cam, including the French partners, pitched in to save it, scrambling to find extra money and ways to reduce costs. Acknowledging that tough times would continue financially and that the rules had changed, Dr. Wiens said he would keep vying for space missions but would ''take another deep breath before we put in another proposal.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Louis D. Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, said he was pleased that the Mars laboratory was able to recover some of its discarded instruments. But he said similar problems would continue and probably get worse with continued budget pressure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How long can you balance budgets at the expense of the science?'' Dr. Friedman asked. ''And is it constructive, in the long run, to tell people that if they have an overrun, even for a legitimate reason, they are in danger of cancellation?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern realizes, he said, that even with good planning and management, there will always be projects that end up costing more than anticipated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll never get all the overruns out of the system,'' he said, ''but we can reduce it and make it less common, if not rare.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- NASA on Monday released an intentionally scrambled, partly deleted version of the safety data it gathered from 24,000 interviews with airline pilots, making good on a promise to Congress to make public information that it said earlier this year would shake public confidence in the airlines and threaten their commercial interest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the agency released the data from the $11.5 million program in a format that made it difficult if not impossible for outsiders to analyze in search of trends, presenting the reports as documents rather than spreadsheets. And the NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, said his agency had no plans to do additional work with the material, which he sought to disown in a conference call with reporters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard for me to see any data here that the traveling public would care about or ought to care about,'' he said. ''But it's also not for me to prescribe what others may care about. We were asked to release the data and I said that we would, and I've done that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As released, the survey data no longer linked pilot reports to the type of plane the pilot flew, the pilot's experience level or other particulars. NASA said the reason was to maintain the anonymity of respondents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sometimes testy exchange with reporters, Dr. Griffin said that it was never NASA's intention to do anything more than test methods of data gathering. The project, called the National Aviation Operations Monitoring System, sought to uncover safety problems by surveying pilots, rather than waiting for them to make anonymous reports, or gathering information from ''black boxes'' or similar sources.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, who extracted the promise from Dr. Griffin to release the information, said that the thousands of pages of ''redacted'' and ''disaggregated'' data put on the Internet on Monday was ''a start but not a satisfactory start.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon said the database, which also includes 5,000 interviews with pilots other than airline pilots, was so extensive that there must be safety insights to be gained from analyzing it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like penicillin or other types of discoveries, it's not what you went in looking for,'' he said. ''I think we're going to find some things that will help us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon and Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina, who is chairman of the investigation and oversight subcommittee, pledged to push NASA further. Mr. Miller said that ''if 80 percent of the pilots they ask agree to sit still for a half-hour survey, voluntarily, my conclusion is the pilots had something they wanted others to know about.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is now 3 years old, and it's been dumped, unanalyzed and scrubbed of much of the useful information,'' Mr. Miller said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin did not say whether the project had yielded any useful insight into how to conduct surveys, which NASA had expected at one point would be extended to mechanics, flight attendants and others. He expressed frustration about his agency's problems in bringing the project to a close. It was, he said, ''intended to have a beginning, a middle and an end, and we seem to be unable to end it, which is a bit frustrating because we don't have the money to continue it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Researchers being funded by the United States government will always have a strong belief that their research work should be extended ad infinitum,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jon A. Krosnick, a professor at Stanford who helped with the survey design, said in a letter to the Science Committee on Dec. 17 that the project had been terminated before it could be expanded beyond pilots to other personnel important to safety.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's discomfort with the study it paid for appeared to arise partly from the differing approaches of engineers, who run NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, and the social scientists who conducted the survey. The engineers tend toward gathering numbers from computers; the social scientists interview people. At the F.A.A., officials have said that the reports in the survey were not sufficiently detailed to be useful. Laura J. Brown, a spokeswoman, said Monday that the survey had gathered ''hangar talk, perceptual data'' that her agency would probably find hard to integrate with its other data sources. But, she said, ''We do intend to see how it can fit with the rest of our data.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next effort to launch the space shuttle Atlantis could come as early as Jan. 24, but will probably slip into February as engineers test and repair a suspect fuel sensor connector, a NASA official said. The official, John Shannon, deputy space shuttle program manager, said experts at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama were to test the electrical connector, taken from the Atlantis's external fuel tank, next week to confirm that it was the source of the problem. Meanwhile, Mr. Shannon said in a telephone news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, technicians at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida will start modifying the shuttle's tank. NASA postponed two efforts in December to fly the Atlantis and its cargo to the International Space Station and had hoped to try again on Jan. 10.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has grudgingly released data from a four-year survey of pilots about the safety of American aviation. The information was released the day before New Year's, with no interpretation of the findings and in a format that is very difficult for outsiders to analyze. If the agency intended to show contempt for the flying public, it succeeded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2000 and 2004, NASA conducted about 29,000 interviews with airline pilots and general-aviation pilots to determine how often they saw risky incidents, like near midair collisions or runway incursions. It was a pioneering effort to determine if reaching out to pilots instead of waiting for them to report incidents might yield insights into emerging problems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, NASA, struggling under a heavy burden of space projects with a limited budget, seems to have lost interest in the aviation study even before any useful conclusions could be drawn about the value of the methodology or the safety significance of early findings. The survey was terminated before it could be extended to air-traffic controllers, flight attendants and mechanics. And NASA at first refused to release any of the data until pressured to do so by Congress.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the agency has reluctantly disgorged partial results that were heavily redacted to protect the identities of pilots. There are tantalizing hints of problems -- complaints about fatigue, pilots asleep on the flight deck and difficulties communicating with air-traffic controllers -- but no indication of how often they occur or whether they are getting worse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has no intention of analyzing the data but does plan to ask the National Academy of Sciences to assess the validity of the methodology. That is not enough. The academy should also assess whether there are any clues in the data that could shed light on air safety. Congress should insist that NASA release the data in a form that can be analyzed by other independent experts. With air corridors growing more congested, it would be nice to know if the surveys -- paid through taxpayer dollars -- turned up anything air travelers need to worry about.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By itself, the discovery of another extrasolar planet, this time by astronomers in Germany, is no big deal. It's just another in what is now a long line of planets found orbiting stars other than the Sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this finding different is what else is orbiting the star, TW Hydrae, some 180 light-years from Earth -- a circumstellar disk of dust and gas, the raw material of a solar system. This is the first time a planet has been found along with such a protoplanetary disk, said one of the discoverers, Johny Setiawan of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Setiawan said the disk had been well studied. It is thick with dust and gas but has a hole, or empty zone, out to five million miles from the star, and a thin, relatively clear zone beyond that for several hundred million miles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also suspected there might be a planet there. Dr. Setiawan and his colleagues found it with a technique, radial velocity, that uses spectroscopy to measure the small movements of a star in relation to Earth caused by the gravitational pull of a planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They report in Nature that the planet is 10 times more massive than Jupiter and less than four million miles from TW Hydrae.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the earlier observations, it was known that TW Hydrae is a very young star, 8 million to 10 million years old. So the planet has to have formed in less than that time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Setiawan said the finding should help refine theoretical models and ''help explain how other planetary systems formed.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers speculate that the formation of the planet, through accretion of dust or some sort of gravitational instability, may account for the ''clearing'' of the disk's thin zone.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of scientists working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory won a round in federal court on Friday in their challenge to a Bush administration requirement that they submit to extensive background checks or face losing their jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in California, issued an opinion allowing the scientists to continue working until the question of their privacy challenge can be addressed at a full trial.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had sued the administration over a new domestic security requirement that all contract workers at the laboratory, which is run jointly by NASA and the California Institute of Technology, undergo background checks and identification requirements. The 26 scientists and engineers filing the suit, whose jobs the government classifies as ''low risk,'' argued that the background checks, which could include information on finances, psychiatric care and sexual practices, constituted an unacceptable invasion of their privacy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government, which is requiring the upgraded security review at every federal agency, argued that the contract employees be held to the same standard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lower court had denied the scientists' request for an injunction to block the background checks; in the opinion released Friday, the court of appeals reversed that decision and sent the case back to the lower court.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is truly a vindication for these scientists and engineers,'' said Dan Stormer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ''They've been loyal and hard-working and committed to science and this country -- and they've been threatened with the loss of their jobs simply because they stood up for their constitutional rights. Any way you address that, it's wrong.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government, Mr. Stormer added, had taken a ''talismanic use of the word 'terror' to overcome constitutional protections.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court's language was strong, stating that the questions asked on the government's forms for the background checks were so ''open-ended and highly private'' that it was ''difficult to see how they could be narrowly tailored to meet any legitimate need'' and there were ''absolutely no safeguards in place to limit the disclosures to information relevant to these interests.'' NASA, the court ruled, had proved no damage that would come to the agency if it could not carry out the background checks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Cabbage, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said, ''NASA will, of course, comply with any rulings from the court of appeals.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA began installing a new connector in the space shuttle Atlantis's fuel tank in hopes of launching the craft in early February, two months late. The agency is aiming for a Feb. 7 launching to deliver Europe's long-awaited Columbus laboratory to the International Space Station. The Atlantis was grounded after fuel gauges in its external tank failed late in the countdown Dec. 6 and again three days later. A fueling test about two weeks later traced the problem to a faulty connector that passes through the bottom wall of the fuel tank and links wiring from the gauges to the shuttle.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Messenger spacecraft dashed past Mercury on Monday, getting a glance at the solar system's innermost planet, which it will eventually orbit for detailed studies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The robot spacecraft, the first to visit the planet in more than three decades, passed about 124 miles above Mercury's cratered surface at 2:04 p.m. E.S.T. before continuing on a path that is to bring it back three more times in the next three years before settling into orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything went really well,'' Eric Finnegan, the Messenger systems engineer, said after the encounter. A faint signal reappeared on schedule after the craft emerged from behind Mercury after the close approach, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the flyby, Messenger was to take more than 1,200 pictures of areas not photographed before and make measurements of the planet's surface chemical composition, wispy atmosphere and gravitational field.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect many surprises,'' said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the mission's lead investigator. Understanding Mercury's history is pivotal to studying the evolution of the inner solar system, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger carried out the encounter on automatic pilot, having turned itself and its main antenna away from Earth on Sunday to get maximum protection from the Sun behind its highly reflective sunshade. The craft is to contact Earth again Tuesday, when it will begin sending back data from the flyby, scientists said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, launched by NASA in August 2004, is only about halfway through a 4.9-billion-mile journey needed to maneuver it into orbit. The journey involves more than 15 trips around the sun, including flying by the Earth once, passing Venus twice and three swings around Mercury before slipping into orbit on March 18, 2011.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The complexity of this mission, with its numerous flybys and multitude of maneuvers, requires close and constant attention,'' said Peter D. Bedini, project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., where the craft was designed and built and the mission is controlled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Messenger streaked past Mercury at more than 16,000 miles per hour but a major goal of the encounter was to use the planet's gravity to slow the craft by 5,000 m.p.h. Two more flybys in October of this year and September 2009 will bleed off enough speed for the spacecraft to orbit the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger -- short for Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging -- is the first spacecraft to visit the planet since NASA's Mariner 10 made three flybys from 1974 to 1975. Mariner 10 mapped 45 percent of the planet, leaving an entire hemisphere a mystery until now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury, with a diameter of 3,030 miles, is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It is the densest of all planets, and it is the only inner planet other than Earth with a global magnetic field, Dr. Solomon said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- NASA is working to solve a potentially dangerous vibration problem in its next generation of launching vehicles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers are concerned that a new rocket, the Ares I, which will replace the space shuttle and send astronauts on their way to the moon, could shake violently during the first minutes of flight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is common to solid rocket boosters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If not corrected, the shaking, which arises from the powerful first stage of the rocket, could ''shake apart the whole structure,'' said Paul Fischbeck, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They know it's a real problem,'' said Professor Fischbeck, who has consulted on risk issues with NASA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern is not the shaking of the first stage, but how it affects everything that sits on top: the Orion crew capsule, instrument unit and a booster.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they hoped to have a plan for fixing the design as early as March and did not expect the problem to delay the goal of returning astronauts to the moon by 2020.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope no one was so ill-informed as to believe that we would be able to develop a system to replace the shuttle without facing any challenges in doing so,'' the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said in a statement to The Associated Press.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA has an excellent track record of resolving technical challenges,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''We're confident we'll solve this one as well.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Jorge Arenas of the Institute of Acoustics in Valdivia, Chile, said that the problem was serious but added that ''NASA has developed one of the safest and risk-controlled space programs in engineering history.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, the space agency has been working on a plan to return to the moon, at a cost of more than $100 billion. Two rockets are planned, the Ares I, which would carry the astronauts into space, and the Ares V, an unmanned heavy cargo ship.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rocket's first stage is composed of five segments derived from the solid boosters that NASA uses to launch the shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shaking problem involves pulses of added acceleration caused by gas vortexes similar to the wake that develops behind a fast-moving boat, said Professor Arenas, who has researched vibration and space launching issues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I vortexes match the natural vibrating frequencies of the rocket's combustion chamber, and the combination causes the shaking.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senior managers were told of the findings last fall, but NASA did not talk about them publicly until The Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request this month and the watchdog Web site Nasawatch.com submitted detailed engineering-oriented questions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first launching of astronauts aboard Ares I and Orion is scheduled for March 2015.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 -- A new survey of astronauts and flight surgeons shows no evidence of crew members' going on space missions drunk or impaired by alcohol, NASA officials said Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anonymous survey, taken over the Internet by all 31 NASA flight surgeons and 87 of 98 current astronauts, is the second recent investigation to find no indication of drunkenness among astronauts immediately before launching into space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inquiries responded to a report last year that cited two unconfirmed incidents in which an astronaut was reportedly impaired by alcohol before flying.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new survey found one isolated incident involving ''an apparent interaction between prescription medication and alcohol,'' Ellen Ochoa, deputy director of the Johnson Space Center and a former astronaut, said on a conference call with reporters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew member in the incident, which was in the final days before a mission, was subsequently cleared for the flight, officials said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In response to a direct question regarding personal observations, all respondents reported never witnessing a crew member consume alcohol, on launch day, in the time leading up to launch,'' a space agency report said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accusations of potentially drunken astronauts arose last July in a report by an independent committee looking into astronaut health care after the arrest of Capt. Lisa M. Nowak of the Navy on charges of attacking a romantic rival at an airport. Captain Nowak was dismissed from the astronaut corps.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA safety chief, Bryan D. O'Connor, investigated different reports. Mr. O'Connor said in a report in August that his interviews with astronauts and flight doctors had found no evidence that they were true.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they did not know whether the drug-alcohol-interaction incident in the new survey was one of those in the original health report.   </p>
