<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A peanut-shaped comet was spewing hundreds of pounds of fluffy ice chunks every second as a NASA spacecraft swung by it two weeks ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, this whole thing looks like a snow globe that you've simply just shaken,'' Peter H. Schultz, a Brown University professor working on the mission, said Thursday during a news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Deep Impact spacecraft passed within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 two weeks ago, producing a series of photographs that showed bright jets coming off a rough surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What fascinated the mission scientists most was that the chunks of water ice in the jets were not being lifted off the surface by the force of water vapor heated by the sun, but rather by jets of carbon dioxide. This was the first time that such carbon dioxide jets had been observed at a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frozen carbon dioxide -- dry ice -- turns to carbon dioxide gas at a temperature of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Water ice stays frozen until it reaches much higher temperatures. Thus, it appears that the carbon dioxide gas on the comet is blowing apart the still-frozen water ice, along with dust particles, and sending it into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists who analyzed the photos of Hartley 2 said that the frozen carbon dioxide within the comet must date from the beginnings of the solar system, because once it turns to gas, it disperses into space. ''If it's there, it's primordial,'' Lori M. Feaga, another member of the science team, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the bright specks seen in the images ranged in size from golf balls to perhaps basketballs, the spacecraft did not suffer any damage as it flew through the storm at a speed of 27,000 miles an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the absorption of light by the specks, the scientists deduced that the chunks were not solid ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not seeing hail-size softballs or even ice cubes,'' said Jessica M. Sunshine, a deputy principal investigator on the mission. ''What we're seeing are fluffy aggregates of very small pieces of ice. And so, they're akin more to maybe a dandelion puff that is very empty air that can be easily broken apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carbon dioxide jets are coming off the two lobe-shaped ends of the comet, which is just three-quarters of a mile long. The spacecraft also found large amounts of water vapor -- and not carbon dioxide -- emanating from the central narrow waist region between the two lobes. This may mean that, for reasons not yet deciphered, the middle part of the comet does not contain much carbon dioxide, and thus the water ice in it can warm into vapor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wouldn't expect this at all,'' Dr. Sunshine said. ''This comet is doing two things at once.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hartley 2 findings differ significantly from what the Deep Impact spacecraft found when it visited Comet Tempel 1 five years ago. At Tempel 1, Deep Impact found water vapor emissions similar to those coming from the middle of Hartley 2, but no carbon dioxide jets and no visible chunks of water ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Tempel 1 visit, NASA decided to reuse the spacecraft, which still had ample maneuvering fuel left, to head to a second comet. The mission was renamed Epoxi, an amalgamation of two acronyms: Epoch, or Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization, which has been using one of the spacecraft's cameras to look at stars known to have planets, and Dixi, or Deep Impact Extended Investigation, for the second comet fly-by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has emphasized how different comets are from one another and how understanding them is a much more complex problem than the rather simplistic approach I like to normally take,'' said Michael F. A'Hearn, Epoxi's principal investigator.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 16 years and $1.5 billion of other people's money, it is almost showtime for NASA and Sam Ting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting and being fussed over by technicians in a clean room at the Kennedy Space Center in preparation for a February launching -- and looking for all the world like a giant corrugated rain barrel -- is an eight-ton assemblage of magnets, wires, iron, aluminum, silicon and electronics that is one of the most ambitious and complicated experiments ever to set out for space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment, if it succeeds, could help NASA take a giant step toward answering the question of what the universe is made of. It could also confer scientific glory on both the International Space Station and a celebrated physicist reaching one last time, literally, for the stars. If it fails, it will validate critics who think it a scandal the experiment was ever approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The device, named the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, is designed to sift the high-energy particles flying through space known as cosmic rays. On Feb. 27, the space shuttleEndeavour will ferry the spectrometer to a permanent berth on the space station. But the real destination is the shadow universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think you learned in high school that the universe is made of atoms and molecules, protons and electrons, stars and galaxies, but over the last few decades astronomers have concluded -- not happily -- that all this is just a scrim overlying a much vaster shadowy realm of invisible ''dark matter'' whose gravity determines the architecture of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they are lucky, scientists say, the Alpha spectrometer could confirm that mysterious signals recorded by other satellites and balloons in recent years are emanations from that dark matter, revealing evidence of particles and forces that have only been theoretical dreams until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if dark matter won't ever become the ultimate diet -- eat it and disappear -- knowing what nature is made of could be useful someday in ways nobody can dream. Einstein's curved spacetime, equally elusive to the senses, proved crucial to the function of GPS devices that were invented decades after Einstein's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or the device could find even something weirder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real discovery is outside the ring of existing knowledge,'' said Samuel Chao Chung Ting, the 74-year-old Nobel laureate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and leader of the cosmic ray project, in his laboratory at CERN outside Geneva in August. A few yards away, the hulking spectrometer was sitting in a test frame, being pinged by a beam of protons in final tests before being shipped to Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting, one of science's great control freaks and worrywarts, has spent his life commanding armies of physicists. In 1974 he discovered a particle that would revolutionize physics, but he took so long checking for errors and looking for more particles that another lab found it and he wound up splitting the Nobel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gazing at his spectrometer, almost ready for space at last, Dr. Ting shrugged off the question of what he had up his sleeve next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You must think I am really stupid,'' he said. ''You see how much trouble this was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment was born in the early 1990s when, despite his prestige, Dr. Ting failed to land a role on the largest physics machines ever contemplated, the Superconducting Supercollider (canceled before completion in 1993 by Congress) or the Large Hadron Collider (now operating at CERN, as the European Organization for Nuclear Research is known).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he turned his eyes to the heavens. According to the laws of physics, equal amounts of matter and its science-fiction-sounding evil twin, antimatter, which annihilates ordinary matter in a flash of energy upon contact, should have been created during the Big Bang. It is one of the abiding mysteries of science why the universe is now all matter. Or is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of a single atomic nucleus heavier than anti-helium could mean there was an anti-star or maybe a whole anti-galaxy somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't do the measurement, you will never know,'' Dr. Ting said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994 Dr. Ting told Dan Goldin, then NASA's administrator, that he could make that measurement with a space-based cosmic ray detector. Mr. Goldin was instantly smitten and agreed to put the spectrometer on the International Space Station, which was desperately lacking scientific credibility, bypassing the agency's normal peer-review procedures and setting off resentment among other cosmic-ray physicists that still lingers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the lure was that the space agency would not have to pay for it. The bulk would be paid for by Dr. Ting's army of collaborators abroad, which grew to 600 scientists from 16 countries, including Italy, Germany, Russia, China and Taiwan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, a prototype of the spectrometer was built and flown successfully on the space shuttle for 10 days on a trip to the Mir space station, although not without some Tingian drama. Behind in the construction schedule, Dr. Ting announced one day that he was canceling the Christmas break. ''Perhaps on Christmas Day we will take a few minutes to reflect,'' Peter Fisher, an M.I.T. physicist who was there, recalled Dr. Ting saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work got done on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle Columbia disintegrated in 2003, killing its crew of seven astronauts, Dr. Ting's fortunes took a turn for the worse. NASA decreed an early end to the shuttle era, and the Alpha spectrometer was dropped from the flight manifest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting fought back. In 2005, invited to address a Senate committee on the state of American science, he used his five minutes and nine transparencies to mount a rousing defense of basic science and of his experiment. ''They were surprised to hear that the space station can do good science,'' Dr. Ting recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the following years powerful senators like Ted Stevens of Alaska, Bill Nelson of Florida and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas sat through Dr. Ting's PowerPoint shows or visited the project at CERN. In the end, Congress ordered NASA to provide an extra shuttle flight for the experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three days after Barack Obama's inauguration, we were back on the manifest,'' Dr. Ting said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then nobody, with the possible exception of Dr. Ting, expected the experiment to find any primordial antimatter. Most theorists have concluded that it disappeared in the first moments after the Big Bang. ''The original goal has evaporated,'' said Greg Tarle, a cosmic-ray physicist at the University of Michigan and longtime critic of the experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the heavens were crackling with intimations of dark matter. Two years ago a European satellite named Pamela registered an excess of anti-electrons, or positrons, in space -- perhaps from collisions of dark matter particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that satellite had no way to tell positrons, which are exotic, from protons, which are humdrum, being the nuclei of hydrogen, and everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alpha spectrometer does. ''It will tell us whether these things are there or not,'' said John Ellis, a CERN theorist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectrometer is a miniature spacegoing version of the cathedral-size particle detectors that now line the Large Hadron Collider. At its heart was to be the most powerful magnet ever flown in space, a superconducting electromagnet like the ones in the collider, which would sort high energy particles according to their electrical charges and momenta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to some physicists, including Dr. Ellis and Dr. Ting, the positrons from dark matter should have a unique spectral signature that the cosmic ray spectrometer can measure. If the signal follows the model, Dr. Ting said, ''Everyone will believe it is dark matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say it will be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish the dark matter signal from the background violence of pulsars and black holes in the local universe. David Spergel, a Princeton astrophysicist, said, ''Cosmic rays are the dirtiest way of looking for dark matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many physicists say they will not be satisfied that dark matter has been found until there is supporting data from particle accelerators and underground experiments that seek to detect the particles directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Burton Richter, who shared the Nobel with Dr. Ting in 1976, said, ''This was a good experiment when Sam proposed it; it's even hotter now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even Dr. Ting's supporters were nonplused by the latest twist in the Alpha experiment saga. Earlier this year, with a fall flight date finally secured, Dr. Ting announced he was ripping out the heart of his experiment and replacing his superconducting magnet with a weaker permanent magnet that had flown on the prototype flight. That meant he would miss the deadline for shipping the instrument to Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA promptly reshuffled the schedule and moved the flight to next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're Sam, you're allowed to show up at the airport a few seconds before your flight,'' Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting gave two main reasons for the last-minute change. Vacuum chamber tests in February revealed that the helium needed to keep the magnet cold and superconducting could run out in as little as two years. Refilling it in space was not an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, he said, the station's lifetime had been extended from 2015 to 2020 or 2028, and it would not be right to occupy space on the station for all those years with a dead experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weaker field of the permanent magnet, Dr. Ting said, would be more than offset by the longer time the equipment would be aloft and a slight redesign of the particle tracking arrays. Indeed, Dr. Ting called it an ''upgrade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the space station was coming down in 2015, we would not change the magnet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late change, however, led to renewed criticism from scientists who wondered if the experiment had been degraded or whether it was even safe to fly now. ''This project has been given some kind of pass on everything,'' said Dr. Tarle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle engineers, however, said they were relieved that they would not have to deal with liquid helium, which can vaporize explosively -- as it did in the Large Hadron Collider two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology, who had helped evaluate the project for the Department of Energy, said in an e-mail that despite the ''apparently flawed process'' by which the experiment had originally been approved, it should fly. ''I wouldn't bet against Sam,'' he added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TASIILAQ, Greenland -- With a tense pilot gripping the stick, the helicopter hovered above the water, a red speck of machinery lost in a wilderness of rock and ice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the right, a great fjord stretched toward the sea, choked with icebergs. To the left loomed one of the immense glaciers that bring ice from the top of the Greenland ice sheet and dump it into the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hanging out the sides of the craft, two scientists sent a measuring device plunging into the water, between ice floes. Near the bottom, it reported a temperature of 40 degrees. It was the latest in a string of troubling measurements showing that the water was warm enough to melt glaciers rapidly from below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the highest we've seen this far up the fjord,'' said one of the scientists, Fiammetta Straneo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temperature reading was a new scrap of information in the effort to answer one of the most urgent -- and most widely debated -- questions facing humanity: How fast is the world's ice going to melt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists long believed that the collapse of the gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica would take thousands of years, with sea level possibly rising as little as seven inches in this century, about the same amount as in the 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But researchers have recently been startled to see big changes unfold in both Greenland and Antarctica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of recent calculations that take the changes into account, many scientists now say that sea level is likely to rise perhaps three feet by 2100 -- an increase that, should it come to pass, would pose a threat to coastal regions the world over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the calculations suggest that the rise could conceivably exceed six feet, which would put thousands of square miles of the American coastline under water and would probably displace tens of millions of people in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists say that a rise of even three feet would inundate low-lying lands in many countries, rendering some areas uninhabitable. It would cause coastal flooding of the sort that now happens once or twice a century to occur every few years. It would cause much faster erosion of beaches, barrier islands and marshes. It would contaminate fresh water supplies with salt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, parts of the East Coast and Gulf Coast would be hit hard. In New York, coastal flooding could become routine, with large parts of Queens and Brooklyn especially vulnerable. About 15 percent of the urbanized land in the Miami region could be inundated. The ocean could encroach more than a mile inland in parts of North Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abroad, some of the world's great cities -- London, Cairo, Bangkok, Venice and Shanghai among them -- would be critically endangered by a three-foot rise in the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate scientists readily admit that the three-foot estimate could be wrong. Their understanding of the changes going on in the world's land ice is still primitive. But, they say, it could just as easily be an underestimate as an overestimate. One of the deans of American coastal studies, Orrin H. Pilkey of Duke University, is advising coastal communities to plan for a rise of at least five feet by 2100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we need immediately to begin thinking about our coastal cities -- how are we going to protect them?'' said John A. Church, an Australian scientist who is a leading expert on sea level. ''We can't afford to protect everything. We will have to abandon some areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea-level rise has been a particularly contentious element in the debate over global warming. One published estimate suggested the threat was so dire that sea level could rise as much as 15 feet in this century. Some of the recent work that produced the three-foot projection was carried out specifically to counter more extreme calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global warming skeptics, on the other hand, contend that any changes occurring in the ice sheets are probably due to natural climate variability, not to greenhouse gases released by humans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such doubts have been a major factor in the American political debate over global warming, stalling efforts by Democrats and the Obama administration to pass legislation that would curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. Similar legislative efforts are likely to receive even less support in the new Congress, with many newly elected legislators openly skeptical about climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large majority of climate scientists argue that heat-trapping gases are almost certainly playing a role in what is happening to the world's land ice. They add that the lack of policies to limit emissions is raising the risk that the ice will go into an irreversible decline before this century is out, a development that would eventually make a three-foot rise in the sea look trivial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melting ice is by no means the only sign that the earth is warming. Thermometers on land, in the sea and aboard satellites show warming. Heat waves, flash floods and other extreme weather events are increasing. Plants are blooming earlier, coral reefs are dying and many other changes are afoot that most climate scientists attribute to global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the rise of the sea could turn out to be the single most serious effect. While the United States is among the countries at greatest risk, neither it nor any other wealthy country has made tracking and understanding the changes in the ice a strategic national priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consequence is that researchers lack elementary information. They have been unable even to measure the water temperature near some of the most important ice on the planet, much less to figure out if that water is warming over time. Vital satellites have not been replaced in a timely way, so that American scientists are losing some of their capability to watch the ice from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The missing information makes it impossible for scientists to be sure how serious the situation is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a scientist, you have to stick to what you know and what the evidence suggests,'' said Gordon Hamilton, one of the researchers in the helicopter. ''But the things I've seen in Greenland in the last five years are alarming. We see these ice sheets changing literally overnight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodging Icebergs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the brilliant sunshine of a late summer day in southeastern Greenland, the pilot at the controls of the red helicopter, Morgan Goransson, dropped low toward the water. He used the downdraft from his rotor to clear ice from the surface of Sermilik Fjord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frigid waters were only 30 feet below, so any mechanical problem would have sent the chopper plunging into the sea. ''It is so dangerous,'' Mr. Goransson said later that night, over a fish dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking the temperature of waters near the ice sheet is essential if scientists are to make sense of what is happening in Greenland. But it is a complex and risky business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two scientists -- Dr. Straneo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and Dr. Hamilton, of the University of Maine -- are part of a larger team that has been traveling here every summer with financing from the National Science Foundation, the federal agency that sponsors much of the nation's most important research. Not only do they remove the doors of helicopters and lean over icy fjords to get their readings, but they dodge huge icebergs in tiny boats and traipse over glaciers scarred by crevasses that could swallow large buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading that the scientists obtained a few weeks ago, of 40 degrees near the bottom of the fjord, fit a broader pattern that researchers have been detecting in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water that originated far to the south, in warmer parts of the Atlantic Ocean, is flushing into Greenland's fjords at a brisk pace. Scientists suspect that as it melts the ice from beneath, the warm water is loosening the connection of the glaciers to the ground and to nearby rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect has been something like popping a Champagne cork, allowing the glaciers to move faster and dump more ice into the ocean. Within the past decade, the flow rate of many of Greenland's biggest glaciers has doubled or tripled. Some of them have eventually slowed back down, but rarely have they returned to their speed of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two seismologists, Meredith Nettles and Goran Ekstrom of Columbia University, discovered a few years ago that unusual earthquakes were emanating from the Greenland glaciers as they dumped the extra ice into the sea. ''It's remarkable that an iceberg can do this, but when that loss of ice occurs, it does generate a signal that sets up a vibration that you can record all across the globe,'' Dr. Nettles said in an interview in Greenland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyzing past records, they discovered that these quakes had increased severalfold from the level of the early 1990s, a sign of how fast the ice is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellite and other measurements suggest that through the 1990s, Greenland was gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to the sea every year. But since then, the warmer water has invaded the fjords, and air temperatures in Greenland have increased markedly. The overall loss of ice seems to be accelerating, an ominous sign given that the island contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 20 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strictly speaking, scientists have not proved that human-induced global warming is the cause of the changes. They are mindful that the climate in the Arctic undergoes big natural variations. In the 1920s and '30s, for instance, a warm spell caused many glaciers to retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John R. Christy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is often critical of mainstream climate science, said he suspected that the changes in Greenland were linked to this natural variability, and added that he doubted that the pace would accelerate as much as his colleagues feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For high predictions of sea-level rise to be correct, ''some big chunks of the Greenland ice sheet are going to have to melt, and they're just not melting that way right now,'' Dr. Christy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet other scientists say that the recent changes in Greenland appear more pervasive than those of the early 20th century, and that they are occurring at the same time that air and ocean temperatures are warming, and ice melt is accelerating, throughout much of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helheim Glacier, which terminates in Sermilik Fjord, is one of a group of glaciers in southeastern Greenland that have shown especially big changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent day, the red helicopter landed on a rocky outcrop above the glacier, a flowing river of ice about 25 miles long and nearly four miles wide. On the side of the canyon, Dr. Hamilton pointed toward a band of light-colored rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was, in essence, a bathtub ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something caused the glacier, one of Greenland's largest, to speed up sharply in the middle of the last decade, and it spit so much ice into the ocean that it thinned by some 300 feet in a few years. A part of the canyon that was once shielded from the sun by ice was thus left exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glacier has behaved erratically ever since, and with variations, that pattern is being repeated all over Greenland. ''All these changes are happening at a far faster pace than we would have ever predicted from our conventional theories,'' Dr. Hamilton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days after the helicopter trip, an old Greenlandic freighter nudged its way gingerly up Sermilik Fjord, which was so choked with ice that the boat had to stop well short of its goal. ''You have to be flexible to work out here,'' said the leader of the team that day, Dr. Straneo of Woods Hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon she was barking orders, and her team swung into motion. A cold, Arctic drizzle fell on the boat and the people. Off the port side in a rickety skiff, David Sutherland, a young scientist at the University of Washington, tossed a floating buoy, carrying a string of instruments, into the water, and an anchor snatched it below the surface. Over the next year, it will measure temperature, currents and other factors in the fjord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sutherland climbed back aboard the freighter with cold, wet feet. As the boat headed back to port, it passed icebergs the size of city blocks, chunks of the Greenland ice sheet bound for the open sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Ocean in Flux</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest reason to think that the level of the sea could undergo big changes in the future is that it has done so in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the waxing and waning of ice ages, driven by wobbles in the earth's orbit, sea level has varied by hundreds of feet, with shorelines moving many miles in either direction. ''We're used to the shoreline being fixed, and it's not,'' said Robin E. Bell, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at all times in the past, when the shoreline migrated, humans either had not evolved yet or consisted of primitive bands of hunter-gatherers who could readily move. By the middle of this century, a projected nine billion people will inhabit the planet, with many millions of them living within a few feet of sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a majority of climate scientists, the question is not whether the earth's land ice will melt in response to the greenhouse gases those people are generating, but whether it will happen too fast for society to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent research suggests that the volume of the ocean may have been stable for thousands of years as human civilization has developed. But it began to rise in the 19th century, around the same time that advanced countries began to burn large amounts of coal and oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sea has risen about eight inches since then, on average. That sounds small, but on a gently sloping shoreline, such an increase is enough to cause substantial erosion unless people intervene. Governments have spent billions in recent decades pumping sand onto disappearing beaches and trying to stave off the loss of coastal wetlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have been struggling for years to figure out if a similar pace of sea-level rise is likely to continue in this century -- or whether it will accelerate. In its last big report, in 2007, the United Nations group that assesses climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that sea level would rise at least seven more inches, and might rise as much as two feet, in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the group warned that these estimates did not fully incorporate ''ice dynamics,'' the possibility that the world's big ice sheets, as well as its thousands of smaller glaciers and ice caps, would start spitting ice into the ocean at a much faster rate than it could melt on land. Scientific understanding of this prospect was so poor, the climate panel said, that no meaningful upper limit could be put on the potential rise of sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report prompted fresh attempts by scientists to calculate the effect of ice dynamics, leading to the recent, revised projections of sea-level rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellite evidence suggests that the rise of the sea accelerated late in the 20th century, so that the level is now increasing a little over an inch per decade, on average -- about a foot per century. Increased melting of land ice appears to be a major factor. Another is that most of the extra heat being trapped by human greenhouse emissions is going not to warm the atmosphere but to warm the ocean, and as it warms, the water expands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the study of the world's land ice still in its early stages, scientists have lately been trying crude methods to figure out how much the pace might accelerate in coming decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One approach, pioneered by a German climate researcher named Stefan Rahmstorf, entails looking at the past relationship between the temperature of the earth and sea level, then making projections. Another, developed by a University of Colorado glaciologist named Tad Pfeffer, involves calculations about how fast the glaciers, if they keep speeding up, might be able to dump ice into the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two methods yield approximately the same answer: that sea level could rise by 2 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet between now and 2100. A developing consensus among climate scientists holds that the best estimate is a little over three feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculations about the effect of a three-foot increase suggest that it would cause shoreline erosion to accelerate markedly. In places that once flooded only in a large hurricane, the higher sea would mean that a routine storm could do the trick. In the United States, an estimated 5,000 square miles of dry land and 15,000 square miles of wetlands would be at risk of permanent inundation, though the actual effect would depend on how much money was spent protecting the shoreline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst effects, however, would probably occur in areas where land is sinking even as the sea rises. Some of the world's major cities, especially those built on soft sediments at the mouths of great rivers, are in that situation. In North America, New Orleans is the premier example, with large parts of the city already sitting several feet below sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defenses can be built to keep out the sea, of course, like the levees of the New Orleans region and the famed dikes of the Netherlands. But the expense is likely to soar as the ocean rises, and such defenses are not foolproof, as Hurricane Katrina proved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storm surges battering the world's coastlines every few years would almost certainly force people to flee inland. But it is hard to see where the displaced would go, especially in Asia, where huge cities -- and even entire countries, notably Bangladesh -- are at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, scientists point out that if their projections prove accurate, the sea will not stop rising in 2100. By that point, the ice sheets could be undergoing extensive melting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Beyond a hundred years out, it starts to look really challenging,'' said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. ''You start thinking about every coastal city on the planet hiding behind a wall, with storms coming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Shortage of Satellites</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Saturday morning a few months back, a University of Colorado student named Scott Potter, sitting in a control room on the Boulder campus, typed a word into a computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''GO.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next 40 seconds, indicators in the control room turned red. Alarms rang. Pagers buzzed. High above the earth, a satellite called ICESat, reacting to Mr. Potter's order, prepared itself to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commotion was expected. Mr. Potter, one of several Colorado students who hold part-time jobs as satellite controllers under professional supervision, was doing the bidding of NASA. His command that day formally ended the ICESat mission, which had produced crucial information about the world's ice sheets for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of August, two weeks after Mr. Potter sent his order, the remains of ICESat plunged into the Barents Sea, off the Russian coast. Its demise was seen by many climate researchers as a depressing symbol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade of budget cuts and shifting space priorities in Washington, several satellites vital to monitoring the ice sheets and other aspects of the environment are on their last legs, with no replacements at hand. A replacement for ICESat will not be launched until 2015 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are slowly going blind in space,'' said Robert Bindschadler, a polar researcher at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who spent 30 years with NASA studying ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several federal agencies and two presidential administrations, Democratic and Republican, have made decisions that contributed to the problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, an attempt by the Clinton and Bush administrations to combine certain military and civilian satellites ate up $5 billion before it was labeled a ''horrendous and costly failure'' by a Congressional committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A plan by President George W. Bush to return to the moon without allocating substantial new money squeezed budgets at NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Obama administration is seeking to chart a new course, abandoning the goal of returning to the moon and seeking a substantial increase in financing for earth sciences. It is also promising an overall strategy for improving the country's environmental observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major elements of the administration's program won support from both parties on Capitol Hill and were signed into law recently, but amid a larger budget impasse, Congress has not allocated the money President Obama requested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, NASA is spending about $15 million a year to fly airplanes over ice sheets and glaciers to gather some information it can no longer get by satellite, and projects are under way in various agencies to plug some of the other information gaps. NASA has begun planning new satellites to replace the ones that are aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The missions that are being designed right now are fantastic,'' said Tom Wagner, who runs NASA's ice programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite difficulties are one symptom of a broader problem: because no scientifically advanced country has made a strategic priority of studying land ice, scientists lack elementary information that they need to make sense of what is happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do not know the lay of the land beneath most of the world's glaciers, including many in Greenland, in sufficient detail to calculate how fast the ice might retreat. They have only haphazard readings of the depth and temperature of the ocean near Greenland, needed to figure out why so much warm water seems to be attacking the ice sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information problems are even more severe in Antarctica. Much of that continent is colder than Greenland, and its ice sheet is believed to be more stable, over all. But in recent years, parts of the ice sheet have started to flow rapidly, raising the possibility that it will destabilize in the same way that much of the world's other ice has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain measurements are so spotty for Antarctica that scientists have not been able to figure out whether the continent is losing or gaining ice. Scientists do not have good measurements of the water temperature beneath the massive, floating ice shelves that are helping to buttress certain parts of the ice sheet in West Antarctica. Since the base of the ice sheet sits below sea level in that region, it has long been thought especially vulnerable to a warming ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cavities beneath ice shelves and floating glaciers are difficult to reach, and scientists said that too little money had been spent to develop technologies that could provide continuing measurements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out whether Antarctica is losing ice over all is essential, because that ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea level by nearly 200 feet. The parts that appear to be destabilizing contain water sufficient to raise it perhaps 10 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist and head of that university's Center for the Environment, praised the scientists who do difficult work studying ice, but he added, ''The scale of what they can do, given the resources available, is just completely out of whack with what is required.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate scientists note that while the science of studying ice may be progressing slowly, the world's emissions of heat-trapping gases are not. They worry that the way things are going, extensive melting of land ice may become inevitable before political leaders find a way to limit the gases, and before scientists even realize such a point of no return has been passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The past clearly shows that sea-level rise is getting faster and faster the warmer it gets,'' Dr. Rahmstorf said. ''Why should that process stop? If it gets warmer, ice will melt faster.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, designed to peer to the edges of the universe and beginning of time, is running about one-third over its $5 billion budget and more than a year behind schedule, an independent review panel reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The James Webb Space Telescope, which already consumes 40 percent of the astrophysics budget at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will actually end up costing $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion, the panel said, and the earliest launching date would be September 2015. NASA gave the go-ahead for the telescope in 2008 expecting that it would be launched in June 2014.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line was that there was just not enough money in the budget to execute the work that was required,'' said the review panel's leader, John R. Casani, a former project manager for NASA's successful Voyager, Galileo and Cassini missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report raised fear that other projects would be hurt. ''This is NASA's Hurricane Katrina,'' said Alan P. Boss, who leads the subcommittee that advises NASA's astrophysics program. The telescope, he said, ''will leave nothing but devastation in the astrophysics division budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope, equipped with a 21-foot-wide mirror and floating almost a million miles above the night side of the Earth, is designed to gather faint infrared light that emanated from the farthest, earliest stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is in good shape technically, the panel said. But it said the Webb project managers had failed to make realistic estimates of the costs and schedule. The report placed further blame on NASA headquarters for not catching the flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Casani said that to meet at 2015 launching date the project would need increases of more than $200 million in both 2011 and 2012, and that panel was not able to come up with suggestions for reducing the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher J. Scolese, NASA's associate administrator, said agency officials agreed with the report's findings and were working to adopt its recommendations, including a better management structure. Richard Howard, the agency's deputy chief technologist, will become the program manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scolese said the agency would devise a new schedule and budget for the telescope and look for where the money would come from. ''We have more homework to do on this,'' he said. But he added, ''I doubt we're going to find $200 million'' to add to the project for 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel and its report followed budget overruns of $95 million in fiscal year 2009 and $20 million in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who leads the appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA, requested the review in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter on Wednesday to the NASA administrator, Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., Ms. Mikulski wrote of ''dismay'' of the poor management and inadequate budgeting that the panel reported. ''We cannot afford to continue with business as usual in this stark fiscal situation,'' she wrote.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something big is going on at the center of the galaxy, and astronomers are happy to say they don't know what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of scientists working with data from NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope said Tuesday that they had discovered two bubbles of energy erupting from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The bubbles, they said at a news conference and in a paper to be published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal, extend 25,000 light years up and down from each side of the galaxy and contain the energy equivalent to 100,000 supernova explosions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're big,'' said Doug Finkbeiner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, leader of the team that discovered them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The source of the bubbles is a mystery. One possibility is that they are fueled by a wave of star births and deaths at the center of the galaxy. Another option is a gigantic belch from the black hole known to reside, like Jabba the Hutt, at the center of the Milky Way. What it is apparently not is dark matter, the mysterious something that astronomers say makes up a quarter of the universe and holds galaxies together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wow,'' said David Spergel, an astrophysicist at Princeton who was not involved in the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And we think we know a lot about our own galaxy,'' Dr. Spergel added, noting that the bubbles were almost as big as the galaxy and yet unsuspected until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, head of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, said, ''This shows again that the universe is full of surprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most surprised was Dr. Finkbeiner. A year ago he was part of a group led by Gregory Dobler of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., that said it had discerned the existence of a mysterious fog of high-energy particles buzzing around the center of the Milky Way. The particles manifested themselves as a haze of extra energy after all the known sources of gamma rays -- the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation -- had been subtracted from Fermi data that had recently been made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Dr. Finkbeiner and his colleagues speculated that the haze was produced by dark matter. The center of the galaxy is home to all manner of wild and woolly high-energy phenomena, including a gigantic black hole and violently spinning pulsars, but cosmological theories also suggest that dark matter would be concentrated there. Collisions of dark matter particles, the theory goes, could produce showers of gamma rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the follow-up analysis, the haze -- besides being bigger than Dr. Finkbeiner and his colleagues had thought -- turned out to have sharp boundaries, like, well, a bubble. Dark matter, according to the prevailing theory, should be more diffuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dark matter has been there billions of years,'' Dr. Finkbeiner explained. ''If something has been going on for billions of years, you wouldn't expect a sharp edge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and the other scientists said this did not mean that dark matter was not there clogging the center of the galaxy, but that it would be harder to see.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a fool's errand to make precise predictions about the future. Even the famously prescient often fall on their faces.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1945, for example, Arthur C. Clarke suggested with astounding foresight that orbiting communications satellites would someday mimic Earth's rotation. But he also predicted that humans would land on Mars in 1994, that the last coal mine would be closed in 2006 and that in 2009, electronic monitoring would mean the end of professional criminals. He had to be kidding about the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was first tempted to make specific predictions for 2011, I wisely resisted my own worst impulses. Then I thought, Why not predict what won't happen? Of course, predicting what won't happen can backfire, too. In 1920 The New York Times ridiculed the idea of the scientist Robert H. Goddard that rockets could leave the surface of the Earth. The newspaper published a correction on July 17, 1969, after the Apollo crew began its journey to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm restricting myself to 2011, mostly, and I've got a lot of confidence in the 9 predictions that follow. In fact, I'll bet the house on them. Of course, the mortgage comes with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here goes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011 human beings will not evolve, much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, I know, we recently evolved the ability to digest milk sugar. Milk sugar? What ever happened to really big evolutionary changes, like giant, bald heads with huge brains and extrasensory perception, or flippers and gills so we could live underwater in the New Atlantis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a year isn't much time to evolve gills, given that we take so long to reproduce and grow up, so I'll extend this prediction to 2111.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will not find any good-size life in outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At best we'll get something microscopic. But I don't foresee us finding anything big enough to see with the naked eye. And that's what people want -- not intelligent life, just something that moves around, maybe hops up and down, and makes some kind of noise (purring would be nice).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will not find the ivory-billed woodpecker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are one of the people who didn't know that we had lost it, well, we did. It happened when we cut down a lot of Southern hardwood forests. And now it seems to be extinct, although there are always new sightings. No doubt there will be more blurry videotapes, with appended proofs that the blur is an ivory bill, but these are as unsatisfying as microscopic extraterrestrials, or Sasquatch footprints. We won't find a Sasquatch either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neanderthals will not be cloned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do I know? Because cloning predictions almost never come true. Remember the armies of cloned supermen, and the rampant identity confusion (because of clones, not credit card theft)? Have you seen them? No, instead we get something like the same cat again, but not exactly. And sheep: Cloning a sheep seems a bit like cloning chairs. How different are sheep from one another anyway?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virtual colonoscopy will not replace the old-fashioned, really invasive one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computerized scans are not up to snuff yet. Besides, doctors would lose money, and until marijuana is legalized, colonoscopies are one of the few legal ways for the over 50 crowd to get high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first human will not be conceived in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This one is actually more of a dare than a prediction. It ought to be possible, and there's nothing lost in the trying. Please, astronauts, make my day, and your own. It will give the world a nice boost to have a space baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one will upload himself or herself (memories, personality, neuroses, creepy desires) into a computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transhuman moment, sometimes referred to as the singularity -- when we, or some of us, transcend our physical bodies and become digital -- will not occur next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope it does in my lifetime, though, because I like the idea of cybermysteries in which people are killed by being erased, or downloaded. But really, my big goal is to see ''download'' replace ''whack'' as a term of art in the world of crime. (''Did you download Charlie?'' ''Yeah, in cement shoes, boss, way down.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atheism will not become a dominant world religion despite the efforts of some scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because atheists, like certain negative prognosticators, are all about what's not -- in this case, they assert, God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole idea of getting together to reaffirm a lack of belief, joining hands and not praying, writing a creed about what they don't believe -- I don't think so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, zombieism: that's an up-and-coming alternative -ism, at least until someone writes them in to all the world's holy books. Then all bets are off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest living animal will not turn out to be a 76-meter (249-foot) octopus in the Mariana Trench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm going out on a limb here, because I'm contradicting Arthur C. Clarke. That's what he predicted for 2011. He also predicted that even larger creatures would be discovered shortly after this octopus event, when we bore through the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa (not happening either).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair to a great man, though, I think he was just fooling around. He made those predictions in <span class="companylink">Reader's Digest</span> in 2001, and by that time he'd been in the prediction game so long he must have been tired of the whole business and decided to say whatever came to mind, which, apparently, was that we would find a giant octopus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, we won't. Happy 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 15, 2010, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the foolishness of making precise predictions in science misstated the number of developments that the writer said would not come true in 2011. There were 9, not 10. The article also misstated the date of a correction in which The New York Times finally apologized for having ridiculed, in 1920, the idea that rockets would one day be able to leave the surface of the Earth. The correction was published on July 17, 1969 -- a day after the Apollo 11 moon mission began; it was not published on June 17 of that year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both planetary science and cosmology are ripe for big news in 2011, the former in its effort to find planets beyond the Earth and the solar system that could harbor water and thus life as we know it, and the latter in the unending effort to figure out what the universe is made of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding out how common habitable planets are around Sun-like stars is the mission of NASA's Kepler satellite, which has been trailing the Earth's orbit of the Sun ever since its launching in March 2009, staring at 156,000 stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra looking for telltale blips in starlight caused by planets passing in front of them. Last June, the Kepler team released a list of 350 stars thought to be harboring planets, but at the same time, and over the protests of some astronomers, they held back the data on 400 more stars that they wanted to check out over the summer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the Kepler 400 are expected to be released. The smallest planet on the previous list was about one and a half times the diameter of the Earth. The Kepler scientists will not say anything about the stars on the withheld list or their candidate planets, but in an e-mail message Natalie Batalha, a co-investigator on Kepler, said it would not be unreasonable to suspect that there is a smattering of planet candidates smaller than that on the new list. More small planets could also show up as more data is analyzed, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of an Earth-size planet would be another step on a path that planet hunters have been following for the past 15 years, since the first exoplanet was discovered. About 500 exoplanets are now known, but most of these have been giant ones circling too close to their stars, because they are easiest to find. As techniques have been refined, smaller planets have come into view, and a recent survey by University of California astronomers, Andrew Howard and Geoffrey Marcy, concluded that about a quarter of all Sun-like stars should have Earth-size planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If indeed there are Earth-size planets in the Kepler 400, however, Dr. Batalha and others hasten to point out, these would not quite be the planets of our dreams. An Earth-like planet -- that is to say, one that is the right temperature for water and thus life as we know it -- would take about a year to complete a circuit around a star like the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler would be lucky to have seen even one blip from a planet in such an orbit in the data analyzed so far and would need an additional year or two to record enough blips to determine that it was indeed in a habitable, water-friendly orbit around a star like our Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called habitable zone around a smaller dimmer star would be smaller, however, and a planet in that zone would complete its orbits more quickly, fast enough to have produced several blips noticeable by Kepler. In September, there was a flurry of excitement when a team of planet hunters led by Steven Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, announced it had detected a small planet, Gliese 581g, in the habitable zone of a dim red star in the constellation Libra. But enthusiasm cooled when a rival team of veteran planet hunters from the University of Geneva said it couldn't find the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Batalha said that if the Gliese planet were in Kepler's patch of sky and did transit its star, the Kepler spacecraft would have seen it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider will enjoy the accelerator's first full year of banging protons together in search of new secrets of nature. On top of Haleakala in Hawaii, the biggest digital camera ever built, with 1,400 megapixels, on a telescope known as Pan-Starrs 1, will continue scanning the sky for killer asteroids -- in that case no news is good news -- and anything else that goes bump in the cosmic night. Another large camera, known as the Dark Energy Survey, will swing into action at a mountaintop observatory in Chile, looking to discern the effects of dark energy on the history and evolution of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any day now, the mystery particle that is presumed to make up the dark matter that amounts to a quarter of creation, and which provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies, could pop out of the collider and leave its tracks in one of a number of underground detectors. Or it could signal its presence in space by high-energy emanations recorded by experiments like NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope or the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a sophisticated cosmic ray detector that will be installed on the International Space Station next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European satellite called Planck will continue its mission, begun in 2009, of surveying a cosmic radio haze left over from the Big Bang for clues to the origin and structure of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Hubble Space Telescope, rejuvenated by on-orbit surgery a year and a half ago, will keep scrutinizing the heavens with its matchless clarity, sifting eternity pixel by pixel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quest goes on, although the role and surely the leadership of American science in it is uncertain. Incoming Republicans have already signaled their desire to whack discretionary spending, which includes nonmilitary research, back to 2008 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would pretty much undo the America Competes Act, which aimed at doubling research funds for a number of government agencies over five years; it was first passed in 2007 and reauthorized by the House of Representatives last summer but is still awaiting a vote in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might be a long wait.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, though, NASA will have a less contentious time pursuing its science missions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists will finally get their first extended look at Mercury. After a trip of six and a half years through the inner solar system, NASA's Messenger spacecraft will finally pull into orbit around Mercury on March 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft has zoomed past Mercury three times, its camera photographing about 98 percent of the surface. Its other instruments have collected intriguing data regarding the magnetic field and the tenuous atmosphere of molecules that are blasted off the planet's surface by the Sun's radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But each of those fly-bys lasted just hours, while the orbital phase of the mission will go on for at least a year. That will allow Messenger to gather enough data to identify elements and minerals in the rocks on Mercury and to observe changes in the atmosphere and magnetic fields as the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle emerges from its quiet period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got the instruments to do that, but we need time in orbit,'' said Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator of the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most intriguing is what Messenger will find when it peers into craters near Mercury's poles. The day side of Mercury reaches 800 degrees Fahrenheit, but within the shadows of the polar craters, where the Sun never shines, temperatures are thought to be around minus 300 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means there could be large deposits of water ice on Mercury. Radar measurements from Earth have already given suggestions of water, but some scientists believe that the deposits could instead be sulfur or silicates, which could produce the same radar results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We hope to have great fun,'' Dr. Solomon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the space shuttle front, NASA hopes to launch Discovery for a final time at the end of this month, carrying supplies to the International Space Station. In February, the shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to make the same trip, bringing up the final piece of the station, a particle physics experiment known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. And then, finally, the space station, already occupied for a decade, will be complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, the six people living there will be able to focus more on what is to be the primary mission for the next decade: a zero-gravity science laboratory. So far, experiments on the station have produced a stream of interesting but not Earth-shaking results, and many scientists criticize the $100 billion cost as money that could have been better spent on research on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie A. Robinson, the program scientist for the space station, said that was unfair, akin to criticizing a 20-year-old for all the time and cost of parenting and college and not yet living up to his or her career potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's exactly where the space station is,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''The fact is, we've done relatively little research on the space station.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, more attention will turn to whether the experiments -- which include growing crystals, studying the bone loss experienced by the inhabitants, and looking at how combustion occurs differently without gravity -- pay off for the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mars, scientists will be looking to NASA's once-and-future rovers, including vehicles that landed there nearly seven years ago and may or may not have life left in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vigil continues for the Spirit, the rover that may already be dead. Trapped in sand, it fell silent this year when its solar panels could no longer produce enough electricity as the Martian winter approached and days shortened. The Spirit will probably never move again, but could still prove valuable as a stationary science outpost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that the rover was able to conserve enough energy to keep its heaters running and that, as the days lengthen again, it will revive and get back in touch with Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At some point, you start to worry when you haven't heard from it,'' said John Callas, the project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Spirit is still silent come March and April, when its solar panels should be producing the greatest amount of energy, then hope will start fading. Still, the mission has already been a remarkable success for a machine that was designed to last only three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the other rover currently on Mars, the Opportunity, should be nearing its next destination, a huge crater named Endeavour, by the end of next year. It has been on a three-year drive covering about a dozen miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Opportunity survives that long, it will be able to investigate terrain that is deeper -- and hence, older -- in Mars's past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's next Mars rover, Curiosity, is to blast off late in 2011. Technical difficulties during its development have delayed the launching for two years, but it is expected to get to Mars about eight months after liftoff, providing planetary scientists with the most detailed exploration to date of the Martian surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size and weight of a small S.U.V., Curiosity dwarfs the Opportunity and Spirit rovers. Its instruments include a laser that will vaporize pieces of rocks and then identify minerals from the colors in the resulting smoke.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery was initially scheduled to make its 39th and final flight last Monday, bearing fresh supplies and an intelligent robot for the International Space Station. But complications delayed the flight from Monday to Friday, when the hydrogen leak led NASA to conclude that the shuttle would not be ready to launch before its flight window closed this Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost at the same time that NASA managers were deciding to delay another attempt until Nov. 30, the opening of the next available launching window, engineers spotted a 7-inch-long crack in protective foam insulation on the side of the giant tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crack, on the side of the tank facing the Discovery, represented a possible source of debris that could have posed a threat to the shuttle's fragile heat shield during the climb out of the dense lower atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said the crack would have been spotted during normal prelaunching inspections and most likely would have prompted a delay even if the hydrogen leak had not developed. In the end, senior NASA managers decided to take the time needed to make sure the problems were well understood and repaired before making another attempt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will come back in late November and give it another shot,'' said Michael Leinbach, the launching director. ''We're going to fly when we're ready, and clearly we were not ready to fly today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's six-member crew -- Cmdr. Steven W. Lindsey; Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force, the shuttle pilot; Col. Benjamin A. Drew Jr., also of the Air Force; Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army; Nicole P. Stott; and Dr. Michael R. Barratt, a physician-astronaut -- flew back to Houston after the launching scrub was announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is attempting an 11-day mission to deliver critical supplies and equipment to the International Space Station. It will be loaded with a new cargo module, more than 6,000 pounds of supplies and equipment and a spare set of cooling system radiators that will be stored outside the lab complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of temperature issues related to the space station's orbit, NASA will have only about one week, from Nov. 30 through Dec. 5 or 6, to get the Discovery off the ground this year. Otherwise, the flight could be delayed until late February, throwing a wrench into NASA's plans for carrying out a final three missions and retiring the shuttle fleet by next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery's not going out easy,'' Mr. Leinbach joked earlier in the week. ''She's giving us a little bit of trouble. But that's fine -- she'll fly perfectly when she does.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft passed within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 about 10 a.m. Eastern time. Soon after, it turned its high-speed antenna toward Earth to beam back the photos it had taken.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People at mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., cheered when the signal from the spacecraft came in and cheered again as the pictures popped up on their computer screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first ones, taken hours earlier while the spacecraft was tens of thousands of miles from Hartley 2, showed a small white dot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they saw several images taken near its closest approach and marveled at odd shape of Hartley 2, which seemed to resemble a peanut or a bowling pin flying through space. Rays of gas and dust were shooting off its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are all holding our breath to see what discoveries await us in the observations near closest approach,'' Michael A'Hearn, a University of Maryland astronomer and the mission's principal investigator, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Deep Impact spacecraft officially completed its mission in 2005 after it visited the comet Tempel 1, letting loose an 800-pound piece of equipment that crashed into that comet as it passed by. The collision allowed scientists to identify some of the minerals beneath the surface of Tempel 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spacecraft still had plenty of maneuvering fuel left, so NASA approved a second mission, called Epoxi, that included a visit to a second comet. Three years ago, the mission had to shift course when the comet it was aiming for, Comet Boethin, could not be found. The backup target was Hartley 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odd shape of Hartley 2 could mean that the comet, three-quarters of a mile wide, was originally two objects that somehow spiraled into each other and stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets are believed to contain primordial materials that date back to the beginning of the solar system, some 4.5 billion years ago. ''If we understand the comets really well, it will tell us how the planets got made,'' Dr. A'Hearn said. ''That's why we choose comets to study.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epoxi is a combination of two acronyms: Epoch, or Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization, which has been using one of the spacecraft's cameras to look at stars known to have planets, and Dixi, or Deep Impact Extended Investigation, for the second comet fly-by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on Earth, NASA had less luck with the space shuttle Discovery, which was originally scheduled to launch on Monday but has been delayed by various setbacks. Most recently, bad weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida postponed the launching to Friday afternoon at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-day mission, which will take supplies to the International Space Station, is to be the 39th and last flight of the Discovery as the space shuttle program winds down.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traveling 27,000 miles per hour, the spacecraft, left over from the Deep Impact mission, will come within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 on Thursday at 9:50 a.m. Eastern time. Hartley 2 will be only the fifth comet to be photographed close up, and the event will make the spacecraft the first to have visited two comets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is going to give us the most extensive observation of a comet to date,'' said Timothy W. Larson, the project manager for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary mission of Deep Impact, launched in January 2005, was to visit Comet Tempel 1. As the spacecraft neared, it separated into two pieces -- the main spacecraft, about the size of a subcompact car, and the 800-pound impactor, which crashed into the comet on July 4, 2005. From a spray of ice and dust gouged from the comet, scientists were able to identify some of the minerals beneath its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets are of particular interest to planetary scientists because they contain almost pristine ingredients from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the crash, the part of Deep Impact that did not slam into the Tempel 1 still had plenty of propellant left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The spacecraft was still in good shape, willing to do more work,'' Dr. Larson said. ''It just needed a new reason for living.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA approved a new mission called Epoxi. The name is a combination of two acronyms: Epoch, or Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization, which has been using one of the spacecraft's cameras to look at stars known to have planets, and Dixi, or Deep Impact Extended Investigation, for the second comet flyby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft was sent on a looping path to intersect Comet Boethin in 2008. Boethin, a mile-wide comet with a 11.8-year orbit, had been visible during its previous passes into the inner solar system, most recently in 1986. But when astronomers looked for it in late 2007, it was nowhere to be seen. Boethin had apparently broken into smaller pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not wanting to send Epoxi to visit a comet that no longer existed, the mission team shifted to Hartley 2, which required an additional two years to reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft has taken 2,000 pictures a day of Hartley 2 as it approaches. The spacecraft cannot keep its high-speed antenna pointed at Earth and its cameras pointed at the comet at the same time. So during its closest approach, the spacecraft will focus on the comet for 18 consecutive hours before turning back to Earth to radio the data. Michael F. A'Hearn, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland and the mission's principal investigator, said Hartley 2 would help scientists understand whether what they learned at Tempel 1 was common among comets or peculiar to that comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three-quarters of a mile wide, Hartley 2 is much smaller than the four-mile-wide Tempel 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite that, it puts out more gas,'' Dr. A'Hearn said. ''This says it's a real active nucleus for its size.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, NASA's other comet spacecraft, Stardust, which flew by Comet Wild 2 in 2006 and caught some grains of dust that it later parachuted to Earth for scientists to study, is also being recycled for another comet encounter. On Feb. 14 next year, it will fly by Tempel 1, the comet that Deep Impact bombarded.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $150 billion, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration could have sent astronauts back to the Moon. The Obama administration judged that too expensive, and in September, Congress agreed to cancel the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a fraction of that -- less than $200 million, along with about $250 million for a rocket -- NASA engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston say they can safely send a humanoid robot to the Moon. And they say they could accomplish that in a thousand days.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, known as Project M, is almost a guerrilla effort within NASA, cooked up a year ago by Stephen J. Altemus, the chief engineer at Johnson. He tapped into discretionary money, pulled in engineers to work on it part time, and horse-traded with companies and other NASA units to undertake preliminary planning and tests. ''We're doing impossible things with really very little, if any, money whatsoever,'' Mr. Altemus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A humanoid dextrous robot -- at least the top half -- already exists: Robonaut 2, developed by NASA and General Motors, is packed on the shuttle Discovery, scheduled for liftoff on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bound for the International Space Station, it will be the first humanoid robot in space. It is to help with housekeeping chores at the space station as NASA learns how astronauts and robots can work together. Eventually, an upgraded Robonaut is to take part in spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project M also draws on other NASA projects that were already under way, including rocket engines that burn liquid oxygen and methane -- a cheap and nontoxic fuel combination -- and an automated landing system that could avoid rocks, cliffs and other hazards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integrating the technologies into working prototypes sped up development. ''That's the magic,'' Mr. Altemus said. ''A lot of times technologies end up in the lab cooking, and then there's this valley of death where they never get to maturation or to flight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project M's planners say that a robot walking on the Moon would capture the imagination of students, just as the Apollo Moon landings inspired a generation of scientists and engineers 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that's going to light a few candles,'' said Neil Milburn, vice president of Armadillo Aerospace, a tiny Texas company working on Project M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as NASA's attention turns away from the Moon -- ''We've been there before,'' President Obama declared in April -- the prospects for sending a robot there are at best uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quandary over Project M encapsulates many of the continuing debates over the future of the space agency: What should NASA be told to do when there is not enough money to do everything? What is the best way to spur advances in space technologies? And given the costs and dangers, how important is it to send people into space at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tricky part is whether it fits in the agency's framework for exploration,'' Mr. Altemus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a blue-ribbon panel was reviewing NASA's human spaceflight program, in particular an ambitious project called Constellation to send astronauts back to the Moon. Although NASA has spent $10 billion on Constellation, most of the program is to be canceled when Congress finishes work on the 2011 budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Altemus, for one, was frustrated by criticism of NASA that emerged during the Constellation debate and elsewhere. ''I always felt like our organization was a Ferrari, and we were never allowed to drive with our foot on the gas,'' he said. ''We were kind of at idle speed all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talking to his son at his kitchen table, Mr. Altemus wanted something that was exciting but not so big that it would require years of deliberation. The idea popped into his head: a walking robot on the Moon, one that could send back live video, in a thousand days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Altemus took it to his staff the next day, telling them, ''Let's do something amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recalled: ''I said, 'Will you get behind me if I put this into the organization? I don't know if we can do it. I don't know if we'll get the money for it or will get approved -- let's try.' And so we just started, and it caught like wildfire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sending a robot to the Moon is far easier than sending a person. For one, a robot does not need air or food. And there is no return trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thousand-day deadline was arbitrary, said R. Matthew Ondler, Project M's manager. ''It creates this sense of urgency,'' he explained. ''NASA is at its best when it has a short time to figure out things. You give us six or seven years to think about something, and we're not so good. Administrations change and priorities of the country change, and so it's hard to sustain things for that long.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the purpose of aiding science education, a thousand days fit easily into the four years that a student spends in high school or college. By contrast, even if NASA achieved Mr. Obama's stated goal of sending astronauts to an asteroid by 2025, a 7-year-old today would have already graduated from college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get the parts they need, Mr. Altemus and Mr. Ondler have resorted to barter. Boston Power gave them a $300,000 prototype of an advanced lithium battery in exchange for engineering help on battery management issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an easy trade, so we made several deals like that,'' Mr. Ondler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armadillo provided a prototype it had built for a lunar lander competition, and NASA exchanged engine technology and access to test facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also paid Armadillo about $1 million, but NASA's traditional development processes would have cost more and taken longer. In six months, the lander flew 18 times under tether and twice in free flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the flights went perfectly, which was the point. ''It's O.K. to put a hole in the ground once in a while,'' Mr. Ondler said. ''It's O.K. to have flame coming out of the wrong end of the engine once in a while, as long as we're learning quickly and building and iterating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ondler told the story of an engineer going to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> to buy about $80 worth of materials to test whether fuel sloshing in the tanks could destabilize the lander during descent. ''From that, we were able to confirm our math models and design the full-scale test,'' he said, all in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project M slipped under the radar of everyone else in NASA, including the administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr. In February, in response to a question about projects that NASA might undertake with other nations, General Bolden cited a two-legged robot that the Japanese space agency wants to send to the Moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do I think I can do that?'' General Bolden said. ''Probably not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, the Project M team was hoping to get a go-ahead to start in March and accomplish the robotic Moon landing by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sophistication of the project, the robot's capabilities would be slight compared with what a human could do on the lunar surface. Project M was conceived as a technology demonstration, not a scientific mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main tasks envisioned for the robot would be to simply pick up a rock and drop it, as part of an education program broadcast to schools. Students could do the same and compare the relative gravity of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work continues on Project M, which has cost about $9 million so far. Armadillo is building a second prototype lander, but there is no money for other aspects, like finishing the legs for Robonaut. Mr. Obama's vision for NASA called for investing $16 billion over five years for space technologies, but the compromise blueprint drawn up by Congress shifts most of the money to a heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project did spark interest among the International Space Station managers, which is why a Robonaut is heading there. ''I'm excited to see how we can evolve the technology in space and actually have a pair of hands and a working humanoid dextrous robot on the space station,'' Mr. Altemus said. ''It's a big move forward for the agency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, the plans for sending one to the Moon are on the back burner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FEW weeks ago, an asteroid almost 30 feet across and zipping along at 38,000 miles per hour flew 28,000 miles above Singapore. Why, you might reasonably ask, should non-astronomy buffs care about a near miss from such a tiny rock? Well, I can give you one very good reason: asteroids don't always miss. If even a relatively little object was to strike a city, millions of people could be wiped out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to telescopes that can see ever smaller objects at ever greater distances, we can now predict dangerous asteroid impacts decades ahead of time. We can even use current space technology and fairly simple spacecraft to alter an asteroid's orbit enough to avoid a collision. We simply need to get this detection-and-deflection program up and running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has already announced a goal of landing astronauts on an asteroid by 2025 as a precursor to a human mission to Mars. Asteroids are deep-space bodies, orbiting the Sun, not the Earth, and traveling to one would mean sending humans into solar orbit for the very first time. Facing those challenges of radiation, navigation and life support on a months-long trip millions of miles from home would be a perfect learning journey before a Mars trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near-Earth objects like asteroids and comets -- mineral-rich bodies bathed in a continuous flood of sunlight -- may also be the ultimate resource depots for the long-term exploration of space. It is fantastic to think that one day we may be able to access fuel, materials and even water in space instead of digging deeper and deeper into our planet for what we need and then dragging it all up into orbit, against Earth's gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, our asteroid efforts may be the key to the survival of millions, if not our species. That's why planetary defense has occupied my work with two nonprofits over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, no one has ever seen the sort of impact that would destroy a city. The most instructive incident took place in 1908 in the remote Tunguska region of Siberia, when a 120-foot-diameter asteroid exploded early one morning. It probably killed nothing except reindeer but it flattened 800 square miles of forest. Statistically, that kind of event occurs every 200 to 300 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, larger asteroids are even fewer and farther between -- but they are much, much more destructive. Just think of the asteroid seven to eight miles across that annihilated the dinosaurs (and 75 percent of all species) 65 million years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a readily achievable detection and deflection system we can avoid their same fate. Professional (and a few amateur) telescopes and radar already function as a nascent early warning system, working every night to discover and track those planet-killers. Happily, none of the 903 we've found so far seriously threaten an impact in the next 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although catastrophic hits are rare, enough of these objects appear to be or are heading our way to require us to make deflection decisions every decade of so. Certainly, when it comes to the far more numerous Tunguska-sized objects, to date we think we've discovered less than a half of 1 percent of the million or so that cross Earth's orbit every year. We need to pinpoint many more of these objects and predict whether they will hit us before it's too late to do anything other than evacuate ground zero and try to save as many lives as we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, how do we turn a hit into a miss? While there are technical details galore, the most sensible approach involves rear-ending the asteroid. A decade or so ahead of an expected impact, we would need to ram a hunk of copper or lead into an asteroid in order to slightly change its velocity. In July 2005, we crashed the Deep Impact spacecraft into comet Tempel 1 to learn more about comets' chemical composition, and this proved to be a crude but effective method.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be necessary to make a further refinement to the object's course. In that case, we could use a gravity tractor -- an ordinary spacecraft that simply hovers in front of the asteroid and employs the ship's weak gravitational attraction as a tow-rope. But we don't want to wait to test this scheme when potentially millions of lives are at stake. Let's rehearse, at least once, before performing at the Met!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has just recommended to Congress that NASA begin preparing a deflection capacity. In parallel, my fellow astronaut Tom Jones and I led the Task Force on Planetary Defense of the NASA Advisory Council. We released our report a couple of weeks ago, strongly urging that the financing required for this public safety issue be added to NASA's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is, surprisingly, not an expensive undertaking. Adding just $250 million to $300 million to NASA's budget would, over the next 10 years, allow for a full inventory of the near-Earth asteroids that could do us harm, and the development and testing of a deflection capacity. Then all we'd need would be an annual maintenance budget of $50 million to $75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By preventing dangerous asteroid strikes, we can save millions of people, or even our entire species. And, as human beings, we can take responsibility for preserving this amazing evolutionary experiment of which we and all life on Earth are a part.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon, at least at the bottom of a deep, dark cold crater near its south pole, seems to be wetter than the Sahara, scientists reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lunar terms, that is an oasis, surprisingly wet for a place that had long been thought by many planetary scientists to be utterly dry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronauts were to visit this crater, they might be able to use eight wheelbarrows of soil to melt 10 to 13 gallons of water. The water, if purified, could be used for drinking, or broken apart into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel -- to get home or travel to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is a very valuable resource,'' said Anthony Colaprete, principal investigator of NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite -- or Lcross, for short -- which made the observations as it, by design, slammed into the Moon a year ago. ''This is wetter than some places on Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sahara sands are 2 to 5 percent water, and the water is tightly bound to the minerals. In the lunar crater, which lies in perpetual darkness, the water is in the form of almost pure ice grains mixed in with the rest of the soil, and is easy to extract. The ice is about 5.6 percent of the mixture, and possibly as high as 8.5 percent of it, Dr. Colaprete said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is a large number, larger than I think anyone was anticipating,'' Dr. Colaprete said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $79 million Lcross mission piggybacked on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which was launched in June last year and has been mapping out the lunar surface for a future return by astronauts. Lcross steered the empty second stage of the rocket, which otherwise would have just burned up in the Earth's atmosphere, onto a collision course with the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, as it neared impact, the Lcross spacecraft released the empty second stage and slowed down slightly so that it could watch the stage's 5,600-mile-per-hour crash into a 60-mile-wide, 2-mile-deep crater named Cabeus. A few minutes later, Lcross, quickly transmitting its gathered data to Earth, met a similar demise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people who watched the live Webcast video transmitted by Lcross, the event was a disappointment, with no visible plume from the impacts. But as they analyzed the data, scientists found everything they were looking for, and more. Last November, the team reported that the impact had kicked up at least 26 gallons of water, confirming suspicions of ice in the craters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new results increase the water estimate to about 40 gallons, and by estimating by amount of dirt excavated by the impact, calculated the concentration of water for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of articles reporting the Lcross results appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also surprising was the cornucopia of other elements and molecules that Lcross scooped out of the Cabeus crater, near the Moon's south pole. Lying in perpetual darkness, the bottom of Cabeus, at minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit, is among the coldest places in the solar system and acts as a ''cold trap,'' collecting a history of impacts and debris over perhaps a couple of billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is quite a reservoir of our cosmic climate,'' said Peter H. Schultz, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University and lead author of one of the Science papers. ''It reflects things that hit the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By analyzing the spectrum of infrared light reflected off the debris plume, Dr. Schultz and his colleagues identified elements like sodium and silver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instruments on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, also watching the impact, identified other compounds, like calcium, magnesium and mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the multitude of minerals, scientists can examine the relative abundances and start speculating about what sorts of objects have been hitting the Moon. Some material looks very similar to what is found in comets. Other minerals look like what is produced by chemical reactions that occur on very cold surfaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's really exciting to me is that Cabeus could be a comet impact site,'' Dr. Colaprete said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lcross and the lunar orbiter are part of NASA's Constellation program, started five years ago by the Bush administration to send astronauts back to the Moon. Arguing that it is too expensive and that the United States has already been there, President Obama has pushed for its cancellation. A compromise on the space agency's future, passed by Congress and signed into law by Mr. Obama last week, sets aside Moon ambitions for now, at least for the return of human explorers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schultz hopes that study of the Moon will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the poles have just opened up a flurry of new questions,'' he said. ''I think it is a destiny that we will go there as humans. I hope it's not just for commercialization.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNITED NATIONS -- There is no United Nations special envoy for space aliens, let's get that straight from the outset, nor even an official designated to pick up the phone should one call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true, however, that a United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs sits in Vienna. (No, it has nothing to do with amorous astronauts, either.) Its task consists basically of monitoring or refereeing cosmic matters -- space debris, for example, or maintaining a list of about 3,000 objects sent hurtling into orbit in the past roughly 50 years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this week, one could argue that with the exception of the scientific community, the office was more obscure than outer space itself. But it has been thrust into the limelight by a scientific conference in Britain whose panels included space-related topics like ''Calling ET, or Not Even Answering the Phone?'' and ''Extraterrestrial Life and Arising Political Issues for the U.N. Agenda.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, basically, is that one day, maybe one day soon, some manner of life or maybe a signal will materialize from another galaxy far, far away. How should earthlings react? Might, for example, the United Nations be designated the spokesman for the entire planet if Darth Vader comes to call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference organizers totally dismissed that latter possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not the little green man in the flying saucer -- that is the wrong image,'' said an organizer, Martin Dominik, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews. What is meant, he explained, were microbes, or perhaps an electronic signal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There could be interaction between life on our planet and life elsewhere so how do we deal with that,'' Mr. Dominik said, warming to the topic. What if the microbes are harmful, for example, or the signal hostile?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The question is should we send messages into outer space or not?'' Mr. Dominik added. ''Is this dangerous? Should we make ourselves visible to extraterrestrial life or not? If they know we are here, do they want to destroy us, will they help us, do we gain something from that? These are all open questions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue becomes more pressing as knowledge of other planetary systems expands and radio telescopes can beam ever more powerful signals into the void. The United Nations could play a valuable role, Mr. Dominik and others noted, in preventing a single nation, or perhaps, the American military from hogging the dance card of the first alien, even if it is a microbe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the United Nations will take a position, exactly. The secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, refused to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no United Nations position on extraterrestrial life,'' said Mazlan Othman, the Malaysian astrophysicist who runs the Office for Outer Space Affairs. (''I am not the ambassador to aliens!'' she said.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a certain recognition that since the 192 United Nations members are generally incapable of reaching agreement on pressing earthly matters like climate change, negotiating a protocol for alien encounters will be one long slog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussion on coping with a threatening asteroid collision has already been grinding on in a subcommittee since 1999, Ms. Othman noted. ''To get consensus on anything at all is difficult at the United Nations -- water, peacekeeping, it is not just extraterrestrials,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's call for sweeping changes in the space program got mugged by lobbyists and pork-minded legislators. An authorization bill for NASA -- the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- that cleared Congress will leave the agency mired in past technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama shocked Congress and the space industry when he announced plans to abandon the Bush administration's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2020 and terminate development of the rockets and crew capsules needed to get there. Instead, he proposed to rely on commercial companies to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station orbit and called on NASA to develop ''game-changing'' technologies to make travel to more distant destinations -- asteroids and eventually Mars -- cheaper and faster.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That made good sense to us as a way to focus NASA on truly venturesome projects while leaving more mundane chores to private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill, which the president is expected to sign and NASA claims to be grateful for, cancels most of the expensive Constellation program that was developing rockets and capsules to establish a base on the Moon. But it orders NASA to develop and fly a new heavy-lift rocket by the end of 2016. The only way to make that deadline (and follow detailed instructions in a Senate report) is by using technologies from existing programs, hardly ''game-changing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is money for research on future space technologies but far less than the president sought. The bill also authorizes an extra shuttle flight beyond those already planned but fails to say where the $500 million to pay for the flight will come from, increasing the risk other NASA programs will be cannibalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A primary goal of those who drafted the legislation was to provide money and save jobs at existing NASA centers and their contractors. At a time of high unemployment, it's hard to argue with that impulse. But the result will be to postpone -- possibly for decades -- the development of the new technologies that could revolutionize long-distance space travel.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A planet orbiting a star causes a slight disturbance in the star's rotation, the effect of the gravitational tug between the star and the planet. Astronomers have been studying the wobbling of stars for a couple of decades, in hopes of finding an exoplanet -- a planet beyond our solar system -- that might offer the possibility of sustaining human life. Now, after 11 years of searching with specialized instruments in Chile and Hawaii, a team of American astronomers has announced in the Astrophysical Journal that it has found the first likely candidate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is called Gliese 581g after its sun, Gliese 581, a red dwarf vastly dimmer than our sun and about 20 light-years from Earth. Potentially habitable does not mean Earthlike. It means that Gliese 581g is the right distance from its sun to be in the habitable zone, able to sustain liquid water and with enough gravity to retain an atmosphere. Gliese 581g orbits its sun in a bit more than 36 days and is almost certainly tidally locked, meaning the same side of the planet always faces the sun. That probably means wide extremes in temperature and a permanent twilight zone between night and day where the climates are more moderate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this discovery so important is that it happened so early in the search for exoplanets and after examining only a tiny sample of small candidate stars as close to Earth as Gliese 581. In the paper reporting their discovery, the astronomers discuss the probable implications with carefully calibrated language that still doesn't hide their excitement. ''If the local stellar neighborhood,'' they write, ''is a representative sample of the galaxy as a whole, our Milky Way could be teeming with potentially habitable planets.'' We are intrigued, too.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, best known as the agency that put the first man on the moon, is about to end its moon program for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under legislation passed by the House late Wednesday, the nation's spaceflight program will take a new direction. NASA -- the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- will turn to private companies to launch astronauts into space, while it starts work on a larger rocket for travel to more distant destinations -- an asteroid, perhaps, and eventually Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill ''helps put the U.S. space program on a more sustainable trajectory,'' Lori B. Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said Thursday during a telephone news conference. ''We now have an important framework.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House, in a 304-to-118 vote on Wednesday, approved a Senate-written bill authorizing $58 billion for NASA over the next three years and setting priorities for the agency. The Senate passed the bill in August, and it now goes to President Obama for his signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As requested by the administration in February, it cancels Constellation, the ambitious program that was to have sent astronauts back to the moon to establish an outpost, but which no longer fits in the budget. NASA has spent more than $10 billion on Constellation in the past five years, mostly on the Ares I rocket and Orion crew capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the compromise legislation does not cancel all of Constellation, as Mr. Obama had originally sought. Development of Orion, capable of deep space missions, is to continue, and the bill directs NASA to develop a heavy-lift rocket able to propel a payload of at least 70 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next skirmish is likely to be over the design of that rocket. The new bill clearly envisions a rocket built of components used in the space shuttles and Constellation's soon-to-be-canceled Ares I rocket. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which wrote the bill, said in an accompanying report that it expected the rocket to include solid-fuel boosters like those of the shuttle or Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some NASA and administration officials have considered switching to the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets currently used to launch satellites for the Air Force. They believe those could be more efficient and less costly because they would avoid infrastructure used only for NASA launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver said that NASA would study all options, including the Delta IV and Atlas V. The legislation calls for NASA to report to Congress in 90 days with a plan for the heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mandate also extends the space shuttle era. Instead of retiring the shuttles in February, it provides money for one more flight to take supplies to the International Space Station in the second half of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pay for the additional shuttle flight and the heavy-lift rocket, the authorization cut deeply into money for future space technologies that NASA had hoped to develop, like orbiting fuel stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lopsided vote in favor of the bill, support for it was not unequivocal. Opponents called it a bad bill; supporters called it flawed, but better than no bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like Candide, it's the best of all possible worlds,'' said John Logsdon, a space policy expert at George Washington University. ''It answers the political imperatives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the transitions have already begun. <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>., the company that builds the solid-fuel boosters for the space shuttles and Ares I, announced 426 layoffs on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the layoffs had been expected as the shuttle program have wound down, but the cuts are also a result of the end of Ares I and Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after Mr. Obama signs the bill into law, NASA cannot yet begin working in earnest on its new mission. Congress has not finished any of the appropriation bills, which set the actual spending levels, for the 2011 fiscal year, which starts Friday. And the stopgap continuing resolution keeps NASA's spending levels -- and programs, including Constellation -- unchanged until after the election in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody from Earth will be visiting anytime soon: The planet, which goes by the bumpy name of Gliese 581g, is orbiting a star about 20 light-years away in the constellation Libra.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the finding is confirmed by other astronomers, the planet, which has three to four times the mass of Earth, would be the most Earthlike planet yet discovered, and the first to meet the criteria for being potentially habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a long haul,'' said Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who, along with R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, led the team that made the discovery. ''This is the first exoplanet that has the right conditions for water to exist on its surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent report for the National Academy of Science, astronomers declared the finding of such planets one of the major goals of this decade. NASA's Kepler satellite -- which was launched in March 2009 as a way to detect Earthlike bodies -- is expected to harvest dozens or hundreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gliese 581g (whose first name is pronounced GLEE-za) circles a dim red star known as Gliese 581, once every 37 days, at a distance of about 14 million miles. That is smack in the middle of the so-called Goldilocks zone, where the heat from the star is neither too cold nor too hot for water to exist in liquid form on its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really the first Goldilocks planet,'' Dr. Butler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other astronomers hailed the news as another harbinger that the search for ''living planets,'' as Dimitar D. Sasselov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics calls them, is on the right track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm getting goose bumps,'' said Caleb Scharf of Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they expressed caution about this particular planet, noting uncertainties about its density, composition and atmosphere, and the need for another generation of giant telescopes and spacecraft in order to find out anything more about it. Other Goldilocks planets have come and gone in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was announced at a news conference Wednesday in Washington, and the findings have been posted on the National Science Foundation's Web site and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors said the relative ease by which planet was found -- in only 11 years -- led them to believe that such planets must be common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Either we have just been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery,'' they wrote in their paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed during the news conference about the possibility of life on Gliese 581g, Dr. Vogt protested that he was an astronomer, not a biologist. Then he relented, saying that, speaking strictly personally, he believed that ''the chances of life on this planet are almost 100 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked the same question, Dr. Butler squirmed and said, ''I like data.'' After a pause he added: ''And what the data say is that the planet is the right distance from the star to have water and the right mass to hold an atmosphere. What is needed simply to find lots and lots of these things is lots and lots of telescope time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest results from Gliese 581 were harvested from observations by two often competing teams, using telescopes in Chile and Hawaii to measure the slight gravitational tugs the star gets as its planets swing by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is hardly the first time around the block for Gliese 581, which is a longtime favorite of planet hunters and now is known to have six planets in its retinue. It is a dwarf star about one-third the mass of the Sun and only about one-hundredth as bright, allowing planets to huddle closer to the campfire. ''It hauntingly reminds us of our own solar system,'' Dr. Butler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of Gliese's planets have already had their moment in the limelight as possible Goldilocks planets. One, known as Gliese 581c, circles just on the inner edge of the habitable zone and was thus thought to be habitable three years ago. But further analysis suggested that the greenhouse effect would turn it into a stifling hell. Another planet, just on the outer edge of the Goldilocks zone, is probably too cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One is on the hot side, the other is on cold side,'' and the new planet is right in between, Dr. Vogt said. ''It's bookended.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues estimated the average temperature on the surface of Gliese 581g to be between 10 and minus 24 degrees Fahrenheit, about the same as a summer day in Antarctica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that means very little, he said, because the planet, like all the others in that system, keeps the same face to the star all the time. So the temperature could vary wildly from the day-side to the night-side of the planet, meaning that an organism could perhaps find a comfortable zone to live in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody really knows what is going on on Gliese 581g, said Sara Seager, a planetary astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''If it was all carbon dioxide, like Venus, it would be pretty hot,'' she said, adding that she would give the planet a 90 percent chance of holding water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, she pointed out, is faint praise in scientific circles. ''Sounds high, but would you fly on a plane that only had an 8 or 9 chance out of 10 of making it?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone is so primed to say here's the next place we're going to find life,'' Dr. Seager said, ''but this isn't a good planet for follow-up.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., is a former board member of <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil</span> and remains a major stockholder. He called a senior Marathon executive in April seeking advice about an alternative-fuel project that NASA was considering.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general, Paul K.

It also raised concerns about an appearance of a conflict of interest, the inspector general said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the call, General Bolden, a two-time space shuttle commander and retired Marine general, held stock in Marathon worth $500,000 to $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general acknowledged to the inspector general that he made a mistake when he talked to Marathon about the fuel project, calling his action ''inappropriate.'' He has since recused himself from the project and has taken refresher ethics training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The episode was the latest in a series of missteps by General Bolden. Over the summer, he said in an interview with the Middle Eastern news network Al-Jazeera that one of NASA's main tasks was to reach out to the Muslim world and help Muslims feel good about their historical contributions to science. NASA and the White House spent a good part of July trying to defend and explain his comments.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> said Wednesday that it was entering the space tourism business, an announcement that could bolster the Obama administration's efforts to transform the National Aeronautics and Space Administration into an agency that focuses less on building rockets and more on nurturing a commercial space industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flights, which could begin as early as 2015, would most likely launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida to the International Space Station. The Obama administration has proposed turning over to private companies the business of taking NASA astronauts to orbit, and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> of Las Vegas won an $18 million contract this year for preliminary development and testing of a capsule that could carry seven passengers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current NASA plans call for four space station crew members to go up at a time, which would leave up to three seats available for space tourists. The flights would be the first to give nonprofessional astronauts the chance to go into orbit aboard a spacecraft launched from the United States. Seven earlier space tourists have made visits to the space station, riding in Russian Soyuz capsules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're ready now to start talking to prospective customers,'' said Eric C. Anderson, co-founder and chairman of Space Adventures, the space tourism company based in Virginia that would market the seats for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Space Adventures have not set a price, although Mr. Anderson said it would be competitive with the Soyuz flights, which Space Adventures arranged with the Russian Space Agency. Guy Laliberte, founder of Cirque du Soleil, paid about $40 million for a Soyuz ride and an eight-day stay at the space station last year. But the prospects that anyone buying a ticket will get to space on an American vehicle hinge on discussions in Congress about the future of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the era of the space shuttle winds down -- two, perhaps three shuttle flights remain -- a clash of visions over what should come next has kept the space agency adrift for much of the past year. An authorization bill written by the House Science and Technology Committee to lay out the direction of NASA for the next three years would largely follow the traditional trajectory for human spaceflight. It calls on NASA to build a government-owned rocket -- likely the Ares I, which NASA has been working on for five years -- for taking astronauts to the space station and then a larger one for missions to the Moon, asteroids and eventually Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competing vision, embodied in President Obama's 2011 budget proposal for NASA, focuses instead on investing in companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> that want to develop the space equivalent of airlines. NASA would then just buy seats on those rockets to send its astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition, the thinking goes, would drive down the costs of getting to space, leading to a profitable new American industry and freeing more of NASA's budget for deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of the free enterprise approach are rallying to block the House version of the NASA authorization bill, which provides only $150 million a year over the next three years for the private-sector space travel initiative, which is known as commercial crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Werb, chairman of the Space Frontier Foundation, was blunt in his assessment of the House bill. ''I think it's awful,'' he said. ''It's leaving NASA with way more pork than program. I see that as a disaster for the agency.'' Mr. Werb's group is urging its supporters to register disapproval with their Congressional representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the president's budget proposed $6 billion over five years for the commercial crew program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Wednesday's news conference, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> officials said that the federal government would have to pay much of the development costs in order for the effort to succeed. ''This is an uncertain market,'' said John Elbon, program manager for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s commercial crew effort. ''If we had to do this with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> investment only and the risk factors were in there, we wouldn't be able to close the business case.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight constraint, of course, is money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a panel led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, concluded that the ambitious program started under President George W. Bush to establish a permanent moon base was ''not executable'' because of inadequate financing. In fact, the panel could not devise any program that could send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit and still fit within the $100 billion allocated to the human spaceflight program in the fiscal years of 2010 through 2020. It offered several alternatives that would require an extra $30 billion over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget request for 2011 sought a modest increase in NASA over all, to $19 billion, but kept the budget projections for the human spaceflight program almost unchanged from the levels that the Augustine panel found inadequate. The panel said that without an increase, the United States should scale back its space ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With that budget,'' Mr. Augustine said in an interview this summer, ''I still think there is no really meaningful space exploration program that involves humans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration worked around the budget shortfall by proposing the cancellation of the entire moon program, known as Constellation, including the Ares I rocket and the Orion crew capsule. Instead, NASA would essentially take a five-year hiatus from large-scale development initiatives and instead work on new technologies that could make the task of space exploration easier and cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House Science and Technology Committee, in its effort to squeeze NASA's human spaceflight program into the budget box, deleted almost all the money from commercial crew and large-scale technology demonstration projects and applied it to slimmed-down Constellation rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Senate passed its version of the NASA authorization bill, which is more of a compromise. It provides less for commercial crew in the first three years than the president's request, but the longer-term plan is to provide the same $6 billion, spread over six years instead of five. It cancels the Ares I rocket and instead directs NASA to begin development of a heavy-lift rocket and indicates that the design should be based on space shuttle technologies, a boon for those contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some experts like Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now heads the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the Senate bill might be repeating the mistake of asking NASA to do too much with too little money. The Senate bill provides less money for development of a larger heavy-lift rocket than the House does for completing the Ares I, already well under development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I respect the need for political compromise,'' Dr. Pace said of the Senate bill, but added, ''It takes some programmatic risk. It spreads itself out too much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff members of the House science committee have been meeting with their counterparts on the Senate's Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation seeking a middle ground. House leaders could move forward with the science committee's bill or substitute the Senate bill or a compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If no final NASA authorization emerges, the Senate and House appropriation committees would decide what to include in NASA's 2011 budget and could end up with something closer to the original Obama proposal.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the triumph of NASA's 1976 Viking mission, which put two unmanned spacecraft on Mars, there was one major disappointment: The landers failed to find carbon-based molecules that could serve as the building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complete lack of these organic molecules was a surprise, and the notion of a desolate, lifeless Mars persisted for years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some scientists say that conclusion was premature and perhaps even incorrect. They suggest that such building blocks -- known as organic molecules, although they need not come from living organisms -- were indeed in the soil, but that they were inadvertently destroyed before they could be detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If true, that could cast the scientific conclusions of the Viking mission in a new light, especially since another Viking experiment claimed to have found living microbes in the soil. Most scientists discounted that possibility -- how could there be life in soil devoid of the building blocks of life?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That gospel of the Viking results has influenced our perspective on life of Mars for 35 years,'' said Christopher McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California and an author of the new findings, to be published in The Journal of Geophysical Research -- Planets. ''What do they find? Nothing. But it turns out it was not really nothing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers scooped Martian soil samples and heated them, looking for organic compounds in the released gases. It found only two -- chloromethane and dichloromethane -- and the scientists concluded that the chlorine compounds were contaminants from fluids used to clean the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in 2008, NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander unexpectedly found a chlorine chemical, perchlorate, in the planet's arctic soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new experiments, the scientists heated a mixture of perchlorate with soil from the Atacama Desert in Chile, often considered the closest thing on Earth to Mars. Chemical reactions destroyed organic compounds in the soil, producing mostly carbon dioxide and traces of chloromethane and dichloromethane, just like what the Viking landers had found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now when we look back at the Viking results, it makes sense,'' Dr. McKay said. ''It was bizarre chemistry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the veteran Mars researcher Gilbert V. Levin, the new paper offers a measure of vindication. His Viking experiment added nutrients to the soil and measured releases of radioactive gas, which would occur as microbes ate the food. Radioactive gas was released, but with the lack of organics in the soil, most concluded it had come from a nonbiological chemical reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael Navarro-Gonzalez of the National Autonomous University of Mexico City and lead author of the new study, said the claim that Viking found life was still inconclusive. ''It gives a big possibility,'' he said, ''but of course we don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levin acknowledged that nonbiological reactions could cause gas to be released, but said the Viking experiment showed that whatever was producing the gas did so at temperatures plausible for microbes but not for other explanations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the leader of the Viking organics experiment, Klaus Biemann, a retired professor at M.I.T., doubts the new interpretation. He noted that the experiment also detected freon, which was certainly a contaminant, and that the presence of perchlorate at the Viking sites, far from where the Phoenix landed, was speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More definitive answers could come with the Mars Science Laboratory, scheduled to be launched next year and to arrive in 2012. It will carry an experiment that will be able to separate perchlorates from organic molecules and thus allow it to identify the organics without destroying them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hundred fifty-four feet long, packed with 700 tons of propellant and anchored to the side of a Utah hill, a solid rocket motor developed for NASA's next generation of rockets is to unleash 3.6 million pounds of thrust in a test Tuesday morning.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this motor design will ever go anywhere is uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To critics, the solid rocket motor -- an elongated version of the boosters that fly on the space shuttles -- is expensive, antiquated technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates counter that solids are reliable and safe and provide a big bang for the buck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is still working on Constellation, the program to send people back to the Moon, and those plans call for the solid rocket motor to serve as the first stage of the Ares I rocket for taking astronauts to the International Space Station and part of the Ares V rocket for the Moon missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Obama administration wants to cancel Constellation, and bills moving through Congress also scale back the human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus NASA will be revisiting the question of what rocket to build next and whether solids will be part of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're starting from scratch, maybe, maybe not,'' said Douglas O. Stanley of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who led a 2005 NASA study that came up with the Constellation architecture. ''If you're starting from where we are now, you don't have to develop the solids. They're already developed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over solids is illustrative of the many questions swirling around the space program's future. Should NASA build on tried-and-true technologies or start over on new designs? Should it aim to build the safest possible rocket, at great cost, or is a rocket that is cheaper and still considerably safer than the space shuttles safe enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid rockets go back to the first rockets, essentially gunpowder in tubes, invented by the Chinese perhaps a millennium ago. NASA's solid rocket motors, built by <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>., or ATK, in Utah, employ the same basic concept: burning the fuel expels hot gases that generate thrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The propellant is a mix of aluminum, ammonium perchlorate, a polymer called polybutadiene acrylonitrile, epoxy and iron oxide poured into cylindrical steel casings 12 feet wide, almost like cake batter into pans. It hardens into the consistency of a pencil eraser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The casings are later stacked at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle booster consists of four segments. NASA has spent a little more than $1 billion developing the longer Ares version, which adds a fifth segment for greater thrust. In the first ground test last September, the engine performed as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's test measures performance at cooler temperatures. Enclosed in a rollaway building, the motor has been chilled to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stanley said the appeal of solid rocket motors is a high thrust-to-weight ratio, which can provide a big, quick push off the launching pad. Solid rocket motors are also much simpler in design, with fewer parts to break than liquid fuel rocket engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Solids tend to buy their way on,'' Dr. Stanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics note that the one failure of a shuttle solid rocket booster was catastrophic: it killed the seven astronauts aboard the shuttle Challenger in January 1986. Defenders point out that the booster itself did not explode; rather, hot gases escaping from a segment joint ignited the liquid fuel in the external tank. A redesign of the joint eliminated the problem, and over all, the solid rocket motors have encountered far fewer technical problems than the shuttle's liquid main engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle solids, Dr. Stanley said, ''have a very high demonstrated reliability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-segment motors would also take advantage of the existing factory that builds the shuttle boosters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For James Muncy, a space policy consultant who has been an ardent critic of Constellation, that is exactly the reason he would like the solids to go away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They work,'' he said. But he added: ''They're expensive. Nobody else needs them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttles never lived up to their initial promises for affordable, frequent access to orbit. The shuttles are complex machines requiring large teams of people to manufacture and assemble the pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Muncy and others conclude that eliminating the shuttle infrastructure is necessary for shaping a leaner, more affordable space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That appeared to be the thinking of the Obama administration and top NASA officials in February when they first called for the cancellation of Constellation and their desire to finance the development of commercial rockets for taking astronauts to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a news conference announcing the administration's proposed 2011 budget for the space agency, Lori Garver, the deputy administrator, said the agency did not plan to buy more solid rocket motors, although ATK could use the motor for its own rocket if it wished to bid for the commercial crew business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With regard to heavy-lift technologies, we're looking at new engine technology programs,'' Ms. Garver said. ''So there is not a funding line certainly not beyond 2010 that we have for solid rocket motors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Congress has resisted the administration plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month the Senate passed an authorization bill for NASA that called for the immediate development of a heavy-lift rocket, which might take advantage of shuttle technologies including the solid rocket motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An equivalent bill under consideration in the House takes a pessimistic view on commercial companies' being able to transport people to space and calls for continued development of a NASA rocket -- presumably Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK has said that the yearly costs for maintaining its factories and producing two motors a year could drop to as little as $300 million a year if it is given enough leeway to run its operations efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Muncy said that as NASA is the only customer of segmented solids, ATK would never produce enough of them to drive down costs further, and NASA alone would continue to pay for ATK's infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He instead favors NASA shifting to using <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed rockets currently used for launching military satellites. That way, he said, the infrastructure costs would be shared by the Defense Department ''and you're not having to pay the fixed costs of something no one else is using and no one else is paying for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Muncy said of Tuesday's test: ''I wish them the best of luck. I don't know why they're doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 1, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a new solid rocket motor developed for NASA misspelled part of the name of a chemical component in the propellant that the motor uses. It is ammonium perchlorate, not ammonia perchlorate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR the past two decades, NASA has been studying what happens to people when they are enclosed in small spaces for long periods of time. The research has yielded insights that might be of use to the 33 Chilean miners, who are likely to be trapped underground for months.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay connected: Researchers studying confinement on long Antarctic missions came to believe in a ''third quarter phenomenon,'' the emergence of depression and anxiety after a mission's halfway point. In two NASA studies involving 13 American and 17 Russian astronauts working on the Mir station and the International Space Station, my colleagues and I found that this response did not typically present itself with space travelers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Simple outside communication. When astronauts seemed to be feeling the blues, Russian space psychologists encouraged them to speak with family, friends and famous people on Earth. They asked them to play music and brighten the lights on board, and they sent unexpected presents and favorite foods on resupply ships. American mission control psychologists have employed similar tactics. For this reason, anything that enhances the link between the miners and family and friends should be encouraged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outsiders: In our orbital studies, we found that crew members displaced intragroup tension and negative feelings to the ''out-group,'' in the astronauts' case, mission control personnel. We all have experienced displacement. You are angry at a boss but can't say anything for fear of reprisal. Instead, you go home and unload on your partner or scream at the parakeet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The miners will probably form subgroups involving people with similar interests and values from whom they can receive solace when they feel angry at someone else. But what if everyone starts to feel frustrated? Will they displace their feelings to the surface, believing that those above aren't trying hard enough to be of help?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important for topsiders to be aware of this possibility. The miners should be made to perceive themselves and people on the surface as a team working together. Also, taking a cue from mission control, where the person who communicates directly with the astronauts is usually also an astronaut, it would be useful to have a trusted miner on the surface speaking with the miners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support the leader: Luis Urzua, a 54-year-old shift foreman, has emerged as the de facto leader of the miners. Decades-long research in the Antarctic found that successful leaders in these situations perform twin (sometimes conflicting) roles: they assign tasks and monitor the emotional states of individuals. Our space research supports these observations. Those above ground should therefore do everything in their power to reinforce Mr. Urzua in these two roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family time: In our work we found that astronauts sometimes worry more about their families on Earth than about themselves in space. While the Chilean government is focusing its attention on the miners, it is crucial that it care for their families, too; knowing that someone is attending to their loved ones will be a relief to the miners, helping them endure the stifling days of confinement ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 444 pp. Viking. $29.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in my career as a science journalist I lucked into what is still one of the most romantic experiences of my professional life. I got to cover the Voyager missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the closest I will ever come to ''Star Trek.'' The two Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, conducted a grand tour of the outer solar system that lasted more than a decade. They cruised over the skies of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and checked out weird landscapes carved in methane and black ice on their many moons, mapping hard features like craters, mountains, cracks, rilles, geysers of sodium and water, and the soft geography, as Stephen J. Pyne memorably calls it, of magnetic fields and radiation belts. They are still traveling. Now roughly 10 billion miles from the Sun, Voyagers 1 and 2 are heading for the boundary of the solar system and interstellar space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over those years we journalists periodically assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where images coming down from Voyager were displayed on television monitors in the pressroom at the same time that scientists huddled in the next building were receiving them. It was like being on the nose of a spaceship. Every morning at 11 o'clock selected members of the Voyager team would assemble in Von Karman Auditorium, nervous and self-conscious, unused to doing science in public, to try to explain what everyone was seeing. Or more often to say that they had no idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were all playing roles with a long tradition, as Pyne, a historian and professor of life sciences at Arizona State University, points out in ''Voyager,'' a meditation on the nature and meaning of exploration itself, disguised as a chronicle of the life and times of a space mission. There are ''moments of exploring that more than any other capture the general imagination, that fuse place, time, discovery and yearning in ways that seem to speak to an era's sense of itself. If they do not inform an age, they do display the vital attributes of an age as nothing else can,'' he writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager, he says, is ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been waiting a long time for a gossipy, intensely reported account of what actually went on in the building next door among the Voyager scientists on their proxy trip to eternity. I wish this were it, but, alas, it's not. Pyne's book, which is based largely on previously published accounts, has deeper concerns. It's a rich mix of history, science and fine writing. Sometimes it seems as if Captain Cook and Prince Henry the Navigator themselves are aboard the busy spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This book blooms with such glorious rushes of exalted prose that I was dog-earing almost every page until I gave up. Contrasting the mission with human explorations from earlier eras, for example, Pyne writes that Voyager was ''a modernist machine loosed onto the cosmos. The Voyagers would not be blinded by gold or the mirage of fame. They would not abandon wife or child, or enslave unwary indigenes. They could not despair, could not be crippled by loneliness, could not fight for the cross or suffer for science, would not know epiphanies or endure tropical fevers. They would lay no claims, issue no proclamations of sovereignty, raise no toasts to king or republic, sign no treaties of trade or military alliance, nor send out reconnaissance parties to lay out routes for folk migration. . . . The Voyagers confronted no Other, or even life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Pyne tells it, there have been three times in Western history when the political, military, economic and, yes, scientific stars aligned to produce an age of exploration. The first wave was during the Renaissance. Think of Christopher Columbus or Magellan. The second great wave, commencing with expeditions to measure the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, had scientific aspirations. Think of Darwin and the Beagle; Lewis and Clark; or Alexander von Humboldt, the German naturalist who traipsed through South America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third wave had its roots in the exploration of Antarctica; the International Geophysical Year (1957-58), which also saw the surprise launching of Sputnik; and the cold war. Voyager owed its existence as well to luck -- a once-every-176-year alignment of the outer planets that made it feasible for a single spacecraft to visit them all on one long excursion through the icy darkness, using the gravity of one planet to slingshot itself to the next, a technique conceived in 1961 by a U.C.L.A. graduate student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pyne details the political maneuvering once a grand tour was endorsed by President Richard Nixon. It was canceled when NASA's budget began to crash in the post-Apollo letdown, then resurrected as a pair of spacecraft. Voyager 2 was launched first, on Aug. 20, 1977. Voyager 1, which would beat its sister to Jupiter and Saturn, followed on Sept. 5. ''Because of politics, the expedition almost didn't happen, and because of politics, it finally did,'' Pyne writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Voyagers spent most of the journey simply cruising through the void, with brief intervals of crazy action and discovery. Pyne handles those encounters with aplomb, highlighting the most memorable moments, but he spends most of the book cruising and ruminating on past explorations and drawing connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparisons to earlier voyages are fun and enlightening. The Portuguese navigators of the 15th century, for example, found that if they wanted to reach southern Africa, they shouldn't just sail down the coast but should go west in an arc, or gran volta, almost to Brazil and then catch the trade winds coming back east. Voyager had its own gran volta, looping past Jupiter in order to get up enough steam to make it to Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other ways, the Voyager missions were utterly unlike their predecessors. For one thing, there were no people on board, so nobody was coming back. Thus there was no way to embody the last stage of the journey of the mythological hero as sketched by Joseph Campbell, the figure who must return with the fruits of his adventure to help humankind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, there was no one to encounter, a subject on which Pyne waxes eloquent. The whole point of exploring, he says, is to meet somebody and be changed, but ''there was no one to enlist as a guide or impress as an interpreter. There was no one to reflect back a self-image of the explorer or serve as a prism to refract visions of the future. There was no one to stand, simply as himself, for an alternative moral universe. There was no one at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Voyager's most telling moments, he writes, were when it turned and looked backward, at the Earth and Moon, at Saturn's rings backlighted by the Sun, or at last the whole solar system with Earth as the famous pale blue dot. As of this writing, the Voyagers have each traveled more than 15 billion winding miles to the very edge of the solar system -- and us with them, only to find ourselves metaphorically back home, and, as T. S. Eliot wrote, to know the place for the first time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still in the process of confirming this candidate is a planet,'' said Matthew Holman, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, at a NASA-sponsored news conference on Thursday. Dr. Holman is the lead author of an article describing the discoveries that the journal Science published on its Web site.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first announcement of a candidate Earth-size planet by the Kepler mission, which in March 2009 launched a one-ton spacecraft to search for planets like ours that just might harbor life. The planet was among more than 700 candidate planets that the team announced in June. If it is made of similar stuff as Earth, its mass would be three to four times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are quickly closing in on Earth-size planets elsewhere in the galaxy as they find planetary systems that look more and more like our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This represents a significant step toward Kepler's goal of determining the frequency of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars,'' Dr. Holman said. Earth-size planets in orbits that are not too hot or too cold are considered the most likely places to look for life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler team also observed, more definitively, two giant, Saturn-size gas planets around the same star, known as Kepler-9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a European team reported what may be a smaller planet, with mass as little as 1.4 times that of Earth, around a star 127 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 15 years since the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star was discovered, astronomers have found close to 500 more. The first were huge gas planets -- composed mostly of hydrogen, similar to Jupiter -- that orbited extremely close to their stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as detection methods improved, astronomers began to find planets closer in size to Earth and planetary systems that contain nearly as many planets as our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth-size planet seen by the European astronomers appears to be one of seven circling the star, HD 10180, located in the constellation Hydrus. Christophe Lovis of the University of Geneva, who led the observations, said the group was certain about the existence of five of the planets, all about the mass of Neptune, but squeezed into orbits closer to the star than Mars is to the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are less certain about the smallest planet. ''For this one, we have about 1 percent false alarm possibility,'' Dr. Lovis said. ''For us, 99 percent is just not enough to be completely sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team also tentatively detected a larger, Saturn-size planet farther from the star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither of the slightly-bigger-than-Earth planets is Earth-like or has much chance for anything to live there. Both have orbits very close to their stars that would sear the surfaces. The small Kepler-9 planet completes an orbit in just over a day and a half at a distance of 2.5 million miles from the star. The small HD 10180 planet is even closer and faster, less than two million miles from the star and completing an orbit in about 28 hours. Earth, by contrast, is 93 million miles from the Sun, and its orbit takes 365 days to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If one particular word can describe planetary systems today, it's 'diverse,' '' said Douglas N. C. Lin, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved with either team. ''Planets are common, and their properties are diverse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, most of the extrasolar planets have been found using the technique of the European team, by looking for wobbles in the wavelength of light from the star caused by the back-and-forth gravitational tugging of unseen planets. The discovery of the HD 10180 planets results from six years of observations at the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the orbits of planets are not edge-on to observers on Earth, the technique underestimates the masses of the planets. Dr. Lovis said that for HD 10180, computer simulations show that for the orbits to be stable, the planets cannot be more than three times the minimum masses calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some planets have been detected when a star dims momentarily as a planet passes in front. The duration of the dip tells the size of the planet, and the time between the light dips tells the length of the planet's orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler mission takes that notion and applies it on a grand scale by staring at a patch of sky in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations to continuously observe the brightness of 156,000 stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kepler scientist, Dimitar Sasselov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, created a stir last month when he said in a lecture that Kepler had discovered many Earth-like planets. He later said that the candidates had not been confirmed and that he should have said Earth-size, not Earth-like. The Kepler instruments cannot measure atmospheric or geological properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the astronomers have seven months of data, and Kepler is scheduled to operate for 3.5 years. Astronomers will soon be able to identify smaller planets farther out, including truly Earth-size planets in orbits that would impart Earth-like temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Come back in a couple of years,'' said William J. Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, ''and we'll give you an answer.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING FOR MARS, I: Mary Roach's jaunty exploration of space travel, ''Packing for Mars,'' plants its flag at No. 6 on the hardcover nonfiction list. Will any astronauts be tossing it in their carry-ons? Some books have been launched into space. Ron Garan, a NASA astronaut who is preparing to fly to the International Space Station in March, has been posting Twitter updates about the books he's taking along, including ''The Blue Sweater: Bridging the Gap Between Rich and Poor in an Interconnected World,'' by Jacqueline Novogratz, and Muhammad Yunus's ''Creating a World Without Poverty.'' He may also find some books left behind by previous travelers, including Goethe's ''Faust'' and Robert A. Heinlein's sci-fi classic ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,'' carried up by the former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> executive Charles Simonyi during his two self-financed voyages.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are there e-books in space? Astronauts do have iPods, according to Robert Pearlman, the editor of the space history Web site collectSPACE, but ''they are of the older, pre-touch-screen generation, and no Kindles, to my knowledge, have made their way to orbit as of yet.'' (Apparently, they have not yet been tested to make sure they don't release dangerous gases.) But astronauts do carry laptops, Pearlman added, and at least one book, ''Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight,'' whose co-editor is the astronaut and physician Michael Barratt, has been read -- and revised -- digitally in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING FOR MARS, II: Roach is known for her salty preoccupation with the body's lower functions, and ''Packing for Mars'' has a lot to say about the challenges of voiding in the void -- or, as she puts it, ''the continuing saga of zero-gravity elimination.'' The space shuttle training toilet at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, it turns out, is equipped with a potty cam. ''Imagine stumbling upon an especially rank porno channel,'' Roach writes, ''then realizing it's you on-screen.'' The bathroom reading is rather limited up there. ''Going to the bathroom in space is a much more 'engaging' activity than here on Earth,'' Pearlman told Roach. ''I suspect therefore not many books make it into the commode.'' Roach confirmed this impression in an e-mail. ''The bathroom reading on the shuttle, based on my time in the shuttle training toilet,'' she said, ''is the 29-step instruction card on the wall!'' As for the downside of too much toilet time, the risk of hemorrhoids may not be that much greater in space. ''Obviously in 1-g there's a pull on your bottom which exacerbates the problem for frequent hemorrhoid sufferers,'' Scott Weinstein, a crew habitability trainer at NASA, said via e-mail. ''But frankly, our astronauts don't have a lot of time for casual reading on the potty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING FOR EARTH: There are about a hundred books in space, according to a 2008 catalog of the International Space Station library posted at governmentattic.org, ranging from ''On the Origin of Species'' to ''The Ten-Day MBA.'' How many are there on Earth? <span class="companylink">Google</span> Books crunched the metadata and came up with a count of all the books ever published: 129,864,880 -- at least as of 8:26 a.m. on Aug 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 29, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A brief report in the Inside the List column last Sunday about Mary Roach's ''Packing for Mars,'' a book on the ways humans adapt to space travel, misstated the location of a toilet equipped with a closed-circuit camera used as a training aid for astronauts. It is at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, not on the space shuttle.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon is shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In making the announcement, scientists were quick to add that the Moon has not shrunk by much, that the shrinking may have occurred over a billion years, and that the Moon will not shrink out of view in the future.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The kind of radius change and shrinking we're describing here is so small that you would never notice it,'' said Thomas R. Watters of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, during a NASA-sponsored telephone news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Watters and his colleagues deduced the Moon's diminishing size from cracks on the surface seen in images taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Moon's core has cooled and contracted, the outer crust fractured into faults, forming ridges as one side of the fracture slid on top of the other. The same cooling and shrinking occurs within all planetary bodies; NASA's Messenger spacecraft recently observed similar -- and much larger -- fractures on the planet Mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest of the Moon ridges is about 300 feet high and stretches for several miles, and some had been seen during the Apollo Moon missions. During Apollo 17, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmidt even drove to one in their lunar rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of the ridges are much smaller and shorter, only tens of yards high, which is why they had escaped notice until the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and its sharp-eyed camera arrived in orbit last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the eons, the shrinkage for the Moon was only about 200 yards, the length of two football fields, out of a diameter of 2,160 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists believe that the ridges are young -- for planetary geologists, a billion years old is young compared with the 4.5-billion-year age of the solar system -- because the ridges cut across small, young craters, but no large craters appear on top of any of the ridges. Large impacts are much rarer and likely to be much more ancient. The ridges also look freshly carved in the moonscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some ridges could be much younger than a billion years, Dr. Watters said, and the shrinking and cracking could be still occurring today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, four seismometers deployed by the Apollo astronauts detected about 30 shallow moonquakes. Dr. Watters said the scientists were looking into the possibility that those moonquakes might have emanated from the newly discovered faults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Wargo, the chief lunar scientist at NASA headquarters, said the findings, which appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science, were more evidence that the Moon was much livelier than its reputation as a cold, unchanging world. ''We're now talking about the Moon in a completely different way,'' Dr. Wargo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A curious lack of older, larger shrinkage cracks may put constraints on current ideas for the origin of the Moon, that it coalesced out of molten wreckage left behind when a Mars-size object slammed into the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Watters said the observations did not argue against the impact theory, but ''our results are really much more consistent with a cooler initial starting temperature for the Moon, a starting temperature that did not allow the entire Moon to melt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: As the lunar interior cooled and contracted, the Moon shrank about 200 yards. As a result its brittle crust ruptured and thrust faults pushed crustal materials up the side of a crater (at arrows) and formed distinctive landforms.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two astronauts, Tracy E. Caldwell Dyson and Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army, took their third spacewalk in the past week and a half to move the 780-pound replacement pump into place and connect the coolant and electrical cables.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pump failed on July 31, disabling one of two external cooling systems. The astronauts were never in immediate danger, but a failure in the second cooling system would have put them in a much more difficult situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all continues to go well, the electrical systems will be largely switched back to the usual configuration by Tuesday afternoon. A final jumper cable rerouting power is expected to be removed Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientific research, largely halted because the astronauts were busy on the pump repair and because of power reductions to avoid overheating, is to resume by next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first spacewalk by Colonel Wheelock and Dr. Caldwell Dyson, on Aug. 7, ran into some difficulty with a balky ammonia line. They overcame that on the second spacewalk, last Wednesday, and removed the broken pump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's 7-hour, 20-minute spacewalk proceeded smoothly. The astronauts accomplished all of their tasks except a lower-priority one unrelated to the pump -- to install an extension cord to preserve access to a power outlet. The outlet will become blocked after the attachment of a cargo module that will be brought up by the next space shuttle mission, scheduled for November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They serve a little more than one million customers, most in rural areas that have no other options. Their services can be painfully slow and cost twice as much as high-speed broadband.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But two companies, WildBlue and HughesNet, are now in a race to change all that. Both plan to launch satellites in the next couple of years that will dwarf their predecessors in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WildBlue's alone will have 10 times the capacity of its three current satellites combined. Such behemoths, the companies say, will enable them, at prices similar to what they now charge, to provide Internet service at speeds many times faster than they now offer -- as fast, in some cases, as fiber connections. Further, the companies argue, satellites can provide service more easily and cheaply per subscriber than their earthbound cable and phone company competitors, particularly to the 14 million to 24 million Americans who live in areas without broadband service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One advantage satellite has is ubiquity,'' Arunas G. Slekys, vice president for <span class="companylink">Hughes Network Systems</span>, said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to satellite's potential in rural regions, ''clearly, there's an unserved market,'' Mr. Slekys said. ''And it's not as though they have terrestrial or satellite. They only have satellite as a choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with their big, shiny new satellites, the companies will still have to overcome earthly concerns. While the new satellites will transmit signals more quickly, there will continue to be slight delays -- a half a second or so -- on users' computers because the signals have to travel 22,000 miles up into space and back down again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the problem of serving residents who are not able to point a satellite dish toward the satellites' location in the southern skies. And then there's the question of making sure satellite modem dishes are clear of snow in winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the satellite companies contend that they should have received a bigger piece of the $7.2 billion in federal stimulus money for extending broadband service to underserved areas in the United States. Of its $2.5 billion share of the stimulus funds, the Agriculture Department is allocating just $100 million in grants to satellite companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas E. Moore, chief of WildBlue, said satellite technology would be able to serve thousands more rural residents than terrestrial services at a fraction of the cost. He cited a $28 million grant to a nonprofit group in North Carolina to extend fiber to 420 schools and libraries. That same grant could have instead directly served 70,000 residents in North Carolina through satellite service, Mr. Moore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For every one of those people, there are literally hundreds more who won't have access to stimulus funds,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joseph Freddoso, president of MCNC, the nonprofit group that manages North Carolina's public education technology network, said satellites were not an ideal primary service for his users, who require a more reliable network for their research and data-heavy applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To compare what we do with what satellite does as a service is an apples-to-oranges comparison,'' Mr. Freddoso said, adding that the grant will serve one million students in 37 counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the strides that satellite companies are taking, other Internet service providers are trying to accelerate their services as well. The life span of a satellite is around 15 years, and the complexity of a broadband satellite, which has three times as many components as TV broadcast satellites, has led the industry to evolve at glacial speeds. And satellites, too, are dependent on complicated rocket launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin R. Laverty, a spokesman for Verizon, agreed that laying down fiber optic cable is expensive initially. But once in place, fiber optic networks can be upgraded much more easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fiber optic is virtually an unlimited technology,'' he said. ''All you have to do is change the electronics on either end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Venech, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span>, says that the speeds his company provides easily surpass even the new offerings from the satellite companies: ''We feel we are strongly positioned to compete against all competitors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite industry has boasted of its capabilities before. In the late 1990s, before the Internet bubble burst, there was a space bubble, said Christopher D. Quilty, a senior vice president in Florida for the investment firm <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp;Associates</span>. ''In the late '90s, there was an overcapacity and overinvestment in everything space.'' He estimated that half a dozen to a dozen satellite broadband initiatives were started globally. ''There were only two surviving projects from that era.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the two, WildBlue, was acquired last December by <span class="companylink">ViaSat Inc</span>., which previously had operations in military, government and commercial satellite communications. The other, HughesNet, is currently operated by <span class="companylink">Hughes Communications</span>. Both are using <span class="companylink">Space Systems/Loral</span> in Palo Alto, Calif., to manufacture their new satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those satellites have more efficient antennas and 100 times the bandwidth of the first-generation broadband satellites 10 years ago, said Christopher F. Hoeber, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Space Systems/Loral</span>. He said residents will have smaller dishes because the new satellites' smaller beams concentrate energy for a stronger connection, less affected by weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More beams also mean satellite frequencies can be reused more often, allowing for greater capacity. WildBlue's satellite, ViaSat-1, is scheduled to be the first to go into orbit, sometime early next year. HughesNet's satellite, Jupiter, will follow in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoeber said first-generation broadband satellites did have problems with weather and delayed transmissions. But he said the new generation, the third, had made notable improvements, as would future versions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's a misperception that the broadband service isn't as good as cable or DSL,'' Mr. Hoeber said. ''And it's not true anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while the two new satellites represent a big step forward, they have little ability, once in space, to adapt to changing technology on the ground. In the future, satellites are likely to have more flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the first steps in that process, the networking company <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> said it had developed the first router for a commercial satellite. The satellite was launched last November, and <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> announced last month that the router successfully supported communications for its first tester, the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Pelton, general manager of <span class="companylink">Cisco</span>'s Internet Routing in Space program, said the router would make satellite communications smoother, allowing a satellite call to be made directly without routing on the ground. ''We're making satellite a full member of the Internet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another manufacturer, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, is building two satellites, to be launched within the next year, that will combine terrestrial and satellite networks in the United States for 4G wireless services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, WildBlue's satellite, ViaSat-1, has started a monthlong test in a thermal vacuum meant to simulate space conditions. HughesNet's Jupiter satellite is still being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Satellite has to evolve at the same rate as terrestrial technologies to be relevant to the market,'' Mr. Moore said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the sun sets over the Atacama Desert in Chile each reliably cloudless night, dazzling ruby red and garnet hues paint the volcanic Andes Mountain peaks in the eastern skyline, deepening almost imperceptibly until they are indistinguishable from black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be the grand finale at many resort areas. But here, it is merely the opening act.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the nearest star had set one evening last August, I peered through the Meade 16-inch telescope in the 15-foot observatory of the Hotel de Larache in San Pedro de Atacama to see the main attraction: the doppelganger Alpha Centauri stars that, without the benefit of magnification, look like one; the misty, yellow Swan Nebula; and the Scorpio Constellation's bi-winged Butterfly Cluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This remote desert, roughly 800 miles north of Santiago, offers some of the clearest views of the Milky Way in the world, making it a natural home to a cluster of high-tech research observatories used by international astronomers. With the opening of a mini-observatory at Hotel de Larache two years ago and several other resort stargazing programs, it has also become a vacation spot for amateur stargazers like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resorts at Atacama are no outliers. Stargazing has increasingly become an alternative to traditional after-sundown dining and drinking at hotels and resorts. Call it night life for nerds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For people who live in the cities -- and more than half the world's population does -- the only way to see the stars in safety and in comfort without worrying about what might happen in the dark is at a resort,'' said Rick Fienberg, a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society, based in Washington. He noted that the International Year of Astronomy in 2009, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the first use of a telescope by Galileo Galilei, brought out millions of people around the world for stargazing events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first encountered stargazing tourism several years ago at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa in Hawaii, a 40-acre resort with sweeping views of Kaanapali Beach. Instead of drinking mai tais at the bar or attending a luau, I joined Eddie Mahoney, an astronomer, who led our group of 12 to the roof of the hotel's nine-story main building. The relatively high perch and resort lighting -- designed to angle down rather than shine up -- preserved the dark setting for his three 50-minute nightly public stargazing sessions ($25 a person).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahoney oriented us by pointing out the North Star, the Big and Little Dippers and the constellation Orion, all visible to the naked eye, of course. But what appeared to be a fuzzy cluster in the sky became clear with binoculars: they were the seven stars in the Pleiades Group. And moving to the 16-inch reflector telescope, far-off planets come into the sharp focus you see in Hubble Space Telescope images: Saturn and its rings, as well as a quartet of Jupiter's moons precisely lined up beside it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly in possession of a 14-inch computerized telescope, Mr. Mahoney still leads stargazing sessions, which he started 10 years ago. Some 6,000 gazers a year take his sky tour, according to the resort management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing light pollution and caring for a planet is an undercurrent of his talks. ''I remind them that Earth is a starship, and we are just passing through,'' said Mr. Mahoney, who distributes -- what else? -- Starburst or Milky Way candies after the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of floating through the galaxy is underscored in the western United States, where low population density and favorable weather combine to make for particularly starry skies. At Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort near Truckee, Calif., Tony Berendsen of Tahoe Star Tours leads summer stargazing programs that merge science and the arts, incorporating poetry readings, string quartet concerts and talks by a visiting astrophysicist. Near Scottsdale, Ariz., the Boulders Resort abjures the science of astronomy in favor of the lore of astrology in its ''Dining With the Stars'' dinners held three times each year, on the summer solstice and the spring and fall equinox dates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had a chance to stargaze out west firsthand this spring during a visit to Colorado. After a day of whitewater kayaking I took part in a decidedly low-tech session at the new Viceroy Snowmass, an opulent 173-room resort on the Snowmass ski slopes near Aspen. Instead of using an observatory or even a telescope, guests sat around a bonfire on the pool deck, faces facing heavenward as the leader, Marieta Bialek, pointed out constellations and planets visible above the mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the planet Venus shining in the west, the overall order of the night sky emerged as the evening progressed. Taking in the panoramic view of the sky was more meditative than scientific, but rewarding nonetheless, especially when a shooting star streaked by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a mystery and wonder about it,'' said Ms. Bialek, leaning back in her chair to point out the constellation Cassiopeia. ''Many people find comfort in the stars. As things are changing around them, the stars stay steady.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That steadiness was evident in the Atacama region of Chile, where there is little night life to compete with the twinkling sky after dark. Nearby resorts that feature stargazing include Tierra Atacama, a stone's throw from Hotel de Larache, and Alto Atacama lodge, which offers guided stargazing nightly, except during full moon phases that wash out the viewing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stargazing at Hotel de Larache is no mere add-on. On my tour there, several gazers took along Pisco sours from the bar to the fireside orientation involving charts and diagrams before navigating paths to the observatory marked in dim red to minimize light pollution. Inside, the dome opened and swiveled under the computerized direction of the scope as it lined up stars and constellations, which the six of us took turns viewing over the next hour, murmuring oohs and aahs normally associated with fireworks and giving us plenty to marvel at over dinner after the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU GO</p>

A group of researchers reports in the journal Science that when the Moon was created, some 4.5 billion years ago, there was not much hydrogen on it, and therefore no water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers determined this by analyzing chlorine isotopes found in lunar rock samples from Apollo missions. The range of chlorine isotopes in lunar samples was 25 times that found in samples from Earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Curious Science of Life in the Void</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mary Roach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 334 pages. <span class="companylink">W. W. Norton &amp;Company</span>. $25.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In conducting research into the physiology of astronauts in space, Mary Roach found out that one man on a Space Shuttle flight wore a sound monitor on his belly for the duration of his voyage. It is Ms. Roach's style to be less interested in the belly-noise findings than in the freaky-deaky part of the story. ''Don't feel bad for him,'' she writes in ''Packing for Mars'' about that awkwardly wired astronaut. ''Feel bad for the Air Force security guy assigned to listen to two weeks of bowel sounds to be sure no conversations including classified information had been inadvertently recorded.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Roach has already written zealously nosy books about corpses (''Stiff''), copulation (''Bonk'') and charlatans (''Spook''). Each time, what has interested her most is the fringe material: exotic footnotes, smart one-liners, bizarre quasi-scientific phenomena. Yet her fluffily lightweight style is at its most substantial -- and most hilarious -- in the zero-gravity realm that ''Packing for Mars'' explores. Here's why: The topic of astronauts' bodily functions provides as good an excuse to ask rude questions as you'll find on this planet or any other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be only slightly unfair to say that Ms. Roach's main focus in ''Packing for Mars'' is scatological. She's interested in borderline mental states too. (''If you carry a bathroom scale to the top of Mount Everest,'' she says, ''you may see that you actually weigh a tiny bit less, not counting the marbles you have obviously lost.'') She also cares about the linguistic acrobatics used by space scientists when they address things they don't want to talk about. A stricture against astronauts' sharing ''undue preferential treatment'' is NASA's way of banning sex in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she cares about one-of-a-kind efforts like the one that the North American Vexillological Association studies in her book's first chapter. Obviously Ms. Roach would have done anything to work the word vexillological into her reporting, and in this case it wasn't even a stretch. Vexillology is the scholarly study of flags. This group analyzed NASA's engineering efforts to plant a flag on the Moon despite an absence of flag-fluttering wind (no atmosphere), extreme heat (2,000-degrees Fahrenheit generated by the nearby descent engine) and a lack of flag-anchoring Moon topsoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's about as serious as ''Packing for Mars'' gets. Ms. Roach is much more enthralled by scientists' curious and curiouser efforts to replicate space conditions on Earth as they analyze every last quirk of the human body. Here's a book that will tell you exactly how bad a stuffy space capsule can smell (''different from the fresh ocean breezes outside,'' the astronaut Jim Lovell tells her, recalling comments made by frogmen who opened the Gemini VII hatch after splashdown) and what happens when astronauts can't bathe for long periods of time. In a book full of smooth segues and clever chapter headings, this section is called ''Houston, We Have a Fungus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chapter called ''The Horizontal Stuff'' is devoted to human guinea pigs who spend months in bed so that the deterioration of immobilized bodies can be studied. One such ''terranaut'' tells Ms. Roach that he loves the meals he's given, particularly the Jell-O. And ''One Furry Step for Mankind'' tells about chimps sent into space. Because Ms. Roach confides every last aspect of her adventures, she describes being sent to what she calls a ''PCLP,'' or Person in Charge of Lying to the Press, when seeking chimp-in-space information. On the grave of Ham, designated the ''World's First Astrochimp,'' she finds both a basket of flowers and a plastic banana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good story. But that's not what Ms. Roach's readers will be chuckling about. The wildest parts of her book involve various forms of human egesta, which is one of her favorite new words. (Another is steatorrhea.) Suffice it to say that for every measurable aspect of human digestion there is a scientist to quantify it, sometimes with a name like Nevin S. Scrimshaw (the benefits of a liquid formula diet) or Kanapathipillai Wignarajah, called Wiggy (human fecal simulants). Some research devoted to astronauts is not as different from commercial diaper testing as you would think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Roach has shown in earlier books, particularly ''Bonk,'' she is completely embarrassment proof. There is no biological situation she will not visualize, no anatomical question she will not ask. So ''Packing for Mars'' is as startling as it is funny, even if its strategic aim is to tell you more than you need to know. ''The report didn't mention anal leakage, but I will,'' she writes about test results on food cubes proposed for astronauts' use. The cubes did not pass muster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As ever, Ms. Roach finds her best material in unexpected places. When she experiences zero gravity on a McDonnell Douglas C-9 military transport jet (better known as the Vomit Comet, though NASA's preferred phrase is Weightless Wonder), she comes back with notes that say ''WOO'' and ''yippee.'' When she rises off the floor and floats, she thinks, ''It's like the Rapture in here every 30 seconds.'' Then she stows away these memories until, later in the book, she considers the implications of zero gravity for porn films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes someone with Ms. Roach's dedication to look at one star in what's supposed to be space and realize that the actress is faking it. This isn't zero gravity. ''Her ponytail is hanging down her back,'' Ms. Roach writes, ''and other things are hanging down her front.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mary Roach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 334 pp. <span class="companylink">W. W. Norton &amp;Company</span>. $25.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who thinks astronauts ply a glamorous trade would do well to read Mary Roach's ''Packing for Mars.'' The book is an often hilarious, sometimes queasy-making catalog of the strange stuff devised to permit people to survive in an environment for which their bodies are stupendously unsuited. Roach eases us into the story, with an anecdote that reveals the cultural differences among spacefaring nations. In Japan, psychologists evaluate astronaut candidates by, among other things, their ability to fold origami cranes swiftly under stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, however, Roach has left all decorum behind. With an unflinching eye for repellent details, she launches readers into the thick of spaceflight's grossest engineering challenges: disposing of human waste, controlling body odor without washing, and containing nausea -- or, if containment fails, surviving a spacewalk with a helmet full of perilously acidic upchuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a wry account, Roach herself braves motion sickness on NASA's ''Vomit Comet,'' a C-9 transport plane modified to fly in parabolas -- the only means of experiencing weightlessness outside of orbit. Its cabin is padded, and on its upward path, passengers are pressed against the floor with a force of roughly twice their body weight. But over the parabola's crest and during the half-minute journey downward, fliers ''rise up off the floor like spooks from a grave.'' Having taken Scop-Dex, NASA's anti-motion-sickness drug, Roach is euphoric. Other passengers -- NASA regulars call them ''kills'' -- are not so fortunate. Violently ill, they have had to be belted into their seats. ''It's like the Rapture in here every 30 seconds,'' Roach declares. ''Weightlessness is like heroin, or how I imagine heroin must be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heroin imagery, I suspect, has as much to do with the motion-sickness meds as with the microgravity. They are a potent combination of scopolamine (an anti-emetic sedative) and dextroamphetamine (a stimulant).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quoting the astronaut Jim Lovell, Roach exposes NASA's untold sanitation woes. The Gemini 7 mission, he says, was ''like spending two weeks in a latrine.'' Roach appears to have combed every mission transcript from the 1960s and '70s for scatological references. The astronauts in ''Packing for Mars'' don't say prim things like ''Houston, we have a problem.'' While on the moon, sitting inside the Apollo 16 lunar module with the astronaut Charlie Duke, John Young blurts: ''I got the farts again. I got 'em again, Charlie. I don't know what the hell gives them to me.'' Roach devotes careful attention to the design of Apollo's ''fecal bag,'' a clumsy receptacle into which germicide had to be manually massaged. In contrast, she portrays the Johnson Space Center's suction toilet as a technological triumph, although docking with its tiny aperture can be a challenge -- requiring ground-based practice on a ''Positional Trainer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admirers of ''Stiff,'' Roach's droll report on the ways that science has used cadavers, will be pleased that ''Packing for Mars'' also contains post-mortem high jinks. The engineering team for the Orion spacecraft (a project scaled back by President Obama) couldn't gather adequate collision data from mere crash dummies, so the team used dead people. In a wonderfully slapstick scene, Roach describes the engineers' efforts to insert a freshly thawed cadaver into a spacecraft mock-up: ''Think of wrestling a comatose drunk into a taxicab.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, fans of ''Bonk,'' her look at the science of sex, will enjoy her relentless inquiry into off-planet mating. When it comes to graphic details, Roach elicits amazing confidences. NASA, she learns, doesn't expect a celibate Mars crew, but one that will ''mix and match or whatever.'' Roach persuades a Russian astronaut to explain ground control's reason for nixing his request for a blowup sex doll: ''We would need to put it in your schedule for the day.'' And a bone-loss-study participant, forced to lie in bed for three months to simulate the effect of weightlessness on his skeleton, divulges where and how study participants conduct their autoerotic lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when I thought there was no question Roach wouldn't ask, and no subject she wouldn't broach, one appeared: emotion. Or, more specifically, grief. While camping on Devon Island, a remote outpost in the High Arctic of Canada, Roach interviews Jon Clark, a flight surgeon who helped investigate the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster. He details for Roach how bodies break apart at high speeds. Then she realizes: he is the widower of the astronaut Laurel Clark, who died on Columbia. Roach -- and the reader -- want desperately to know how he coped with the loss, and how he continued to do this grisly work. But she refuses to find out: ''It seemed insensitive to ask.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happily, Roach does not dwell on Lisa Nowak, the astronaut who drove from Texas to Florida, allegedly in diapers, to confront her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend. She does, however, point out that male astronauts have a diaper alternative that fits directly onto their anatomy. In the way of <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, where a small is termed a ''tall,'' the men's devices come only in L, XL and XXL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a long-duration Mars trip, urine would have to be recycled, which is not as vile as it sounds. ''I will tell you sincerely and without exaggeration that the best part of lunch today at the NASA Ames cafeteria is the urine,'' Roach writes, adding that after purification and desalination, it tastes like Karo syrup. Her husband, however, doesn't share her keenness and protests when she stores her urine in their refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest parts of ''Packing for Mars'' chart the American space effort during the cold war. Roach deals less knowingly with the situation today, when space is, as the private entrepreneurs say, a place, not a program. While investigating zero-gravity sex, she mentions that Robert Bigelow, the founder of Budget Suites America, plans to build an orbiting hotel. But she doesn't convey that NASA itself has begun spurning Big Aerospace boondoggles (like Orion) in favor of shoestring alternatives (a contract with tiny, upstart <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for cargo flights to the International Space Station).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Roach refuses to grapple with grief, she also plays down spaceflight's greatest danger: radiation, for which no cost-efficient shielding has yet been engineered. Linked to brain damage and rapid-onset leukemia, it could quickly devastate a Mars crew. In contrast to excrement and sex, which have dedicated chapters, radiation surfaces in a scattershot, piecemeal fashion. Roach states that astronauts are classified as ''radiation workers'' because they receive such high doses. She tells us that cosmic rays -- high-energy heavy ions from outside our solar system -- can be damaging to cells, and that hydrogen compounds (not metal spacecraft hulls) are required for shielding. But she never directly addresses the radiation from solar flares, and makes a joke about a brilliant idea that, in my view, deserves a chapter of its own: on a Mars mission, the astronauts' solid waste (rich in hydrocarbons) could be wrapped around the crew quarters to protect against cosmic rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the book's end, after more than 300 pages of debunking the romance of spaceflight, Roach herself buys into that idea, making a misguided, emotional pitch for a $500 billion human Mars mission -- at the expense of cheap, reliable, robotic missions. I am not impervious to sentimentality. I felt a surge of tenderness when Roach described the ''unlikely heroics'' of a patch of moss on Devon Island: ''something so delicate surviving in a place so stingy and hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet compared with the irradiated void of space, a frozen rock in the High Arctic is as cozy as a baby's crib. Packing for Mars, Roach has shown, can be entertaining here on Earth. But no way are humans ready to make the actual trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 29, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A brief report in the Inside the List column last Sunday about Mary Roach's ''Packing for Mars,'' a book on the ways humans adapt to space travel, misstated the location of a toilet equipped with a closed-circuit camera used as a training aid for astronauts. It is at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, not on the space shuttle.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael T. Suffredini, manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he was ''disappointed'' the astronauts ran into the unexpected snag, saying a third spacewalk likely will be needed to resolve the leak and bring a replacement pump on line.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ammonia QDs are known to be sensitive systems,'' he said referring to the quick-disconnect fittings. ''They're very complicated; it's very high-pressure ammonia you have to try to be able to disconnect and reconnect on a regular basis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will get thorugh this problem,'' he said. ''The challenge is to get through this problem before the next problem hits the other cooling system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pump shorted out last Saturday, knocking one of the lab's two ammonia coolant systems out of action and forcing the six-member crew to reduce power usage throughout the station to keep critical equipment from overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Expedition 24 crew was not in any immediate danger, but the reduced power meant an interruption of scientific research and left the lab one failure away from a major cooling problem that could, in a worst-case scenario, force the crew to evacuate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Army Col. Douglas H. Wheelock, making his fourth spacewalk, and Tracy Caldwell Dyson, making her first, originally planned a seven-hour excursion to disconnect four coolant system lines and five electrical cables. They then hoped to remove the failed pump and install a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally, the spacewalk on Wednesday was to reconnect the ammonia coolant lines and finish any work that did not get done Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, the initial stages of the spacewalk went smoothly, and the first of the four coolant lines was disconnected without incident. But the astronauts ran into major problems releasing a quick-disconnect fitting on the second line, known as M3. After initially opening the mechanism, Colonel Wheelock reported a clearly visible ammonia leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see little sparklets of ammonia coming from the line,'' he observed. He then was told to close the mechanism in a bid to seal the leak, but he was unable to reopen the latch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling well behind schedule, Colonel Wheelock and Dr. Dyson pressed ahead and had no problems disconnecting the two remaining coolant lines. One of those, along with the first line to be removed, was plugged into a so-called jumper box to help maintain the proper pressure inside the coolant lines as the station moves into and out of sunlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making one final attempt to release the jammed M3 connector, Colonel Wheelock finally coaxed it open by lightly hammering on the mechanism. But the leak reappeared and a shower of ammonia ice crystals could be seen breaking off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Wheelock retightened the quick-disconnect fitting and left the line in place before heading back to the station's airlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of exposure to a toxic material, the astronauts had to delay re-entering the station to give any residual ammonia on their suits time to evaporate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRAPHICS: Work on the Cooling System: Over the course of two spacewalks, one on Saturday and one scheduled for Wednesday, astronauts aboard the International Space Station plan to replace a failed ammonia pump module with a spare that is stored on a nearby platform.

The space agency scheduled two spacewalks to repair the damage and said the astronauts, three Americans and three Russians, were in no danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the incident underlined a deeper concern about the orbiting station's long-term health. If this or any other problem should result in a need to abandon the station, the United States' human spaceflight program would lose one of its last remaining reasons for being.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the 12-year-old space station was an afterthought in the multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to return people to the Moon and possibly push off to Mars. But in the shifting priorities under the Obama administration, the station has become a keystone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only is it supposed to serve as a scientific laboratory and an example of successful international collaboration, the administration also wants it to provide a market to nurture a commercial space industry for launching people and cargo into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a much more central role in this decade under the Obama plan than it did under the Bush plan,'' said John M. Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Moon program, known as Constellation, has been hamstrung. Although pieces of it could survive in bills under consideration in Congress, it remains unclear what rockets NASA is to build, what their destinations would be and how long it would take to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the space station, NASA's financing of commercial rockets to take crew and cargo there would almost certainly evaporate. And without government financing, companies would be unlikely to invest billions of dollars to pursue a speculative market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no question it's a risky business strategy,'' said James A. M. Muncy, a space policy consultant who supports the Obama space policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, the current director of the Space Policy Institute, said abandoning the station might even mark the end of the human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My concern,'' he said, ''is without an overarching political impetus, the energy to restart a human spaceflight program would be very hard to achieve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Congressional aide, who was not authorized to speak for attribution, said, ''You're in a position where we were in 1962, where you don't have a place to go.'' With the remaining space shuttles to be retired next year, he said, ''you don't even have a launch vehicle that can travel to low-Earth orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling problem, which has limited research aboard the space station so equipment does not overheat, is only the latest glitch to befall it. In the past, navigation computers have crashed, a rotating joint on the solar arrays started grinding and vibrating, and the toilets have not always worked. In each case, engineers identified the problem and found a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I.S.S. is a living, breathing beast,'' Michael T. Suffredini, the space station manager, said in an interview last month. ''Some days everything doesn't exactly work perfectly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, NASA officials say that over all the station is in good shape, even as its lifetime is being extended five years, to 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, in preparation for life after the space shuttle, NASA has launched as many of the large spare parts as it could and stored them on the outside of the station. The station has four spare pumps of the type that failed Saturday, and managers said they had planned for exactly this type of failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini said that only a radiator was too large to fit into any spacecraft other than the shuttle, and that piece is to fly up on the next shuttle mission in November. Equipment on the station has also been lasting longer than predicted, he said, adding, ''If we get thrown curveballs along the way, we have time to react to them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling pump was an exception: Expected to last 100,000 hours (more than 11 years), it failed after only about 80,000 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the shuttles, it will not be possible to bring parts back to Earth for diagnosis and repair. That could be significant for something like the pump. There is no room to bring the faulty pump back on the next two shuttle missions, but it could be brought back on an additional flight that is likely to be added to the schedule for next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat of a collision with micrometeoroids is small, but not zero. Mr. Suffredini said the chances of a strike severe enough to require evacuation were about 1 in 100 over a six-month period. Over 10 years, the cumulative risk is nearly 1 in 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate bill outlining the budgets and goals for NASA for the next three years asks the space agency to conduct a detailed study to ensure that it is prepared for operating the station until 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recent breakdown of the station's cooling system emphasizes how critical it is that we understand all of the equipment needs the space station will have as its service life is extended,'' Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who pushed for that provision, said in a statement. ''We must assure that NASA has a plan to deliver those elements or bring parts down for analysis and repair once the space shuttle is finally retired.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three specks of matter captured by the NASA spacecraft Stardust may be stardust that has just entered our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have all the hallmarks of interstellar dust,'' said Andrew Westphal of the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Westphal reported the first speck in March, and he described the second and third on Friday at a meeting of the Meteoritical Society in Manhattan. Each speck is about one-25,000th of an inch across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third is particularly intriguing. It is rich in carbon, raising the possibility that it is full of the molecules that could serve as the building blocks for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stardust's primary mission was to bring back bits of a comet that it passed in 2004, but scientists also hoped that it would also trap some interstellar particles within a wispy concoction known as aerogel that served as a cosmic dust collector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft completed its seven-year ride through the solar system in 2006 and, as it swung past Earth, detached a capsule containing the collected particles, which parachuted down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then -- with help from an army of amateur researchers -- scientists began the painstaking process of distinguishing the interstellar specks from ordinary solar-system dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a car in a snowstorm, the solar system is flying through a cloud of interstellar gas at 55,000 miles an hour, so stardust enters from one particular direction. By analyzing the directions from which particles strike the aerogel, scientists can determine which ones are from the interstellar cloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Dr. Westphal said the prospect of locating the interstellar dust particles was initially hopeless. ''It's kind of the equivalent of trying to find 50 ants on a football field,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead -- ''totally out of desperation,'' he said -- the scientists turned to non-experts around the world to sift through thousands of images. Today, about 29,000 people -- or ''dusters,'' as they call themselves -- take part in the Stardust@Home project, which Dr. Westphal directs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interspersed test images allow the researchers to check how well the dusters are doing, and the dusters compete for the top scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first presumed interstellar particle -- actually two distinct pieces -- was found by a Canadian duster, Bruce Hudson, who retired as a carpenter and groundskeeper after a stroke. Mr. Hudson said he had looked through 25,000 images, spending as much as 5 to 10 hours a day at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You get so caught up in it,'' he said. He named the two pieces Orion and Sirius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second was discovered by Naomi Wordsworth, a circuit designer in England, who heard about Stardust@Home from a BBC television program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought it was a wonderful opportunity for anyone to become involved with real space research and I joined straight away,'' Mrs. Wordsworth said. ''Although I spend my working days in front of a computer solving problems and verifying designs, I found it was quite relaxing to look through the photos and concentrate on the visual images.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She named her speck Hylabrook, after the name of her parents' house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers have yet to check their database to identify the person who turned up the carbon-rich third particle, which turned up only two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the scientists have a rough breakdown of the chemical elements in the dust specks, based on X-ray imaging, but they do not know much else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are deliberately not doing as much analysis as we could,'' Dr. Westphal said. ''Our great-grandchildren would curse us if we ruin these things. We're immensely aware if we drop one on the floor, it would cost $300 million'' -- roughly the cost of the Stardust mission -- ''to get another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They still cannot say for certain that the three are interstellar particles. To do that, they would have to risk extracting the bits from the aerogel and analyze the oxygen isotopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For reasons not understood, the solar system has a higher percentage of oxygen-18 relative to oxygen-17. If the particles are indeed from beyond the solar system, their oxygen isotopes would contain the lower amounts seen elsewhere.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, lit up the Internet last month with a statement that would stir the soul of anyone who ever dreamed of finding life or another home in the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandishing data from NASA's Kepler planet-finding satellite, during a talk at TED Global 2010 in Oxford on July 16, Dr. Sasselov said the mission had discovered 140 Earthlike planets in a small patch of sky in the constellation Cygnus that Kepler has been surveying for the last year and a half.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next step after Kepler will be to study the atmospheres of the planets and see if we can find any signs of life,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Dr. Sasselov was busy eating his words. In a series of messages posted on the Kepler Web site Dr. Sasselov acknowledged that should have said ''Earth-sized,'' meaning a rocky body less than three times the diameter of our own planet, rather than ''Earthlike,'' with its connotations of oxygenated vistas of blue and green. He was speaking in geophysics jargon, he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he should have called them ''candidates'' instead of planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Kepler mission is designed to discover Earth-sized planets but it has not yet discovered any; at this time we have found only planet candidates,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: keep on moving, nothing to see here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've heard that a lot lately. Call it the two-sigma blues. Two-sigma is mathematical jargon for a measurement or discovery of some kind that sticks up high enough above the random noise to be interesting but not high enough to really mean anything conclusive. For the record, the criterion for a genuine discovery is known as five-sigma, suggesting there is less than one chance in roughly 3 million that it is wrong. Two sigma, leaving a 2.5 percent chance of being wrong, is just high enough to jangle the nerves, however, and all of ours have been jangled enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only three weeks ago, rumors went flashing around all the way to Gawker that researchers at Fermilab in Illinois had discovered the Higgs boson, a celebrated particle that is alleged to imbue other particles with mass. The rumored effect was far less than the five-sigma gold standard that would change the world. And when the Fermilab physicists reported on their work in Paris last week, there was still no trace of the long-sought Higgs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists at particle accelerators don't have all the fun. Last winter, physicists worked themselves up into a state of ''serious hysteria,'' in the words of one physicist, over rumors that an experiment at the bottom of an old iron mine in Minnesota had detected the purported sea of subatomic particles known as dark matter, which is thought to make up 25 percent of creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists all over the world tuned into balky Webcasts in December to hear scientists from the team, called the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, give a pair of simultaneous talks at Stanford and Fermilab, and this newspaper held its front page, only to hear that the experiment had detected only two particles, only one more than they would have expected to find by chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all went to bed that night in the same world in which we had woken up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One culprit here is the Web, which was invented to foster better communication among physicists in the first place, but has proved equally adept at spreading disinformation. But another, it seems to me, is the desire for some fundamental discovery about the nature of the universe -- the yearning to wake up in a new world -- and a growing feeling among astronomers and physicists that we are in fact creeping up on enormous changes with the advent of things like the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva and the Kepler spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't say what the discovery of dark matter or the final hunting down of the Higgs boson would do for the average person, except to paraphrase Michael Faraday, the 19th-century English chemist who discovered the basic laws of electromagnetism. When asked the same question about electricity, he said that someday it would be taxable. Nothing seemed further from everyday reality once upon a time than Einstein's general theory of relativity, the warped space-time theory of gravity, but now it is at the heart of the GPS system, without which we are increasingly incapable of navigating the sea or even the sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest benefit from answering these questions -- what is the universe made of, or where does mass come from -- might be better questions. Cosmologists have spent the last century asking how and when the universe began and will end or how many kinds of particles and forces are needed to make it tick, but maybe we should wonder why it is we feel the need to think in terms of beginnings and endings or particles at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for planets, I no longer expect to see boots on Mars before I die, but I do expect to know where there is a habitable, really Earthlike planet or planets, thanks to Kepler and the missions that are to succeed it. If such planets exist within a few light-years of here, I can imagine pressure building to send a probe, a robot presumably, to investigate. It would be a trip that would take ages and would be for the ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a deadline of sorts for Kepler in the form of a conference in December. By then, said William J. Borucki, Kepler's leader, the team hopes to have moved a bunch of those candidate planets to the confirmed list. They will not be habitable, he warned, noting that that would require water, which would require an orbit a moderate distance from their star that takes a year or so to go around. With only 43 days' worth of data to analyze yet, only planets with tighter, faster and hotter orbits will have shown up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They'll be smaller, but they will be hot,'' Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler has three more years to find a habitable planet. The real point of Dr. Sasselov's talk was that we are approaching a Copernican moment, in which astronomy and biology could combine to tell us something new about our place in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know that science does not exist just to fulfill my science-fiction fantasies, but still I wish that things would speed up, and the ratio of discovery to hopeful noise would go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardly a week goes by, for example, that I don't hear some kind of rumor that, if true, would rock the Universe As We Know It. Recently I heard a rumor that another dark matter experiment, which I won't name, had seen an interesting signal. I contacted the physicist involved. He said the results were preliminary and he had nothing to say.</p>

Mission managers gave tentative approval on Sunday to plans for a complex two-spacewalk repair job late this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling system, which dissipates heat generated by the lab's electronics, initially shut down around 8 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday when a circuit breaker tripped, setting off warning alarms that awoke the crew. With reduced cooling, flight controllers were forced to shut down two of the space station's four stabilizing gyroscopes, used to help control the lab's orientation; one communications channel; and several computer control units.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station's flight engineers, Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army and Tracy E. Caldwell Dyson, also had to install jumpers between the Russian Zarya propulsion module and the United States segment of the station to prevent additional cooling problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the station's six-member crew -- including a third American, Shannon Walker, and three Russians, the commander Aleksandr Skvortsov, Mikhail Kornienko and Fyodor Yurchikhin -- was not in any immediate danger. But the loss of a cooling system will cripple station operations until the problem can be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By tomorrow, a little bit later on, hopefully we'll be able to send you up a little bit better idea of where we stand on everything,'' the astronaut James M. Kelly radioed from Mission Control shortly before the astronauts returned to bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few hours later, the alarms blared again when flight controllers tried to restart the stalled coolant pump. Once again, a circuit breaker blew, indicating a problem with the pump module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the morning, one of the two powered-down gyroscopes was reactivated. Although the station's main switching units, which direct power to various subsystems, were running a bit hotter than normal, engineers said the laboratory was in a stable configuration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station is equipped with two independent cooling systems, or coolant loops, mounted on the lab's main solar power truss. While the loops are independent, the station cannot operate at full power with just one. Spare components are on board, including two coolant system pumps, but installation is considered difficult and two spacewalks will be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers and managers at the Johnson Space Center gave preliminary approval on Sunday for ''an initial spacewalk no earlier than Thursday by Wheelock and Caldwell Dyson to replace the pump module,'' NASA said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two have not trained for a pump module replacement but had extensive spacewalk training together. The spare 780-pound coolant pump, built by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, is mounted on an external platform just in front of the station's airlock module, relatively close to the faulty pump module. The pump module measures five and a half feet long, a bit more than four feet across and three feet high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repair plan calls for the astronauts to first remove the failed unit, temporarily stow it and then move the new pump into position. The second spacewalk would be devoted to making a variety of electrical connections and hooking up ammonia coolant lines.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images on view at a remarkable exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum here could well serve as inspirational space cards for this century. But they possess far greater power than those old naive fantasies. They are vividly, compellingly real; they astonish and bewilder, luring the viewer into a state of wonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''Beyond: Visions of Our Solar System'' 148 photographs of moons and planets show these brave new worlds as extraordinary landscapes of mists, dunes, fissures and rocks. The exhibition has appeared in other, more modest incarnations (including as a traveling show), but this is its most complete form. The filmmaker, writer and photographer Michael Benson deserves much credit for the refinement of these images, but we need no technical understanding of their origins to be struck by what they portray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clouds surrounding Venus have disappeared as radar images reveal a terrain of sharp-edged ridges, volcanic craters, petrified lava flows and delicate striations -- testimony to a relentlessly active geographical furnace. We see the blue copperish haze of a Martian sunset -- not the invention of a painter of a child's bubble-gum cards but the actual scene from the planet's surface, a small sun penetrating the atmosphere's powdery dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturn is photographed as if by a tourist who can't get enough shots of the Eiffel Tower, though now the viewer only wishes there were more. It is as if the material world had been left behind for a realm of eerie golden textures, delicately shaded rings and suspended threads of light. Jupiter, in all its immensity, is almost eclipsed by the impression left by its tiny moon Europa, which has a surface like the skin of an aged man's skull, seeming almost transparent, showing veins beneath thin flesh, its crusts and ridges the relics of ancient forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some images -- umbilical coils of roiling fire from the surface of the Sun or Martian dunes with dark spots marking the melting of carbon-dioxide frost -- almost appear to be abstractions, bearing little resemblance to anything familiar. As for Earth seen from space, even that sight is presented anew, the planet outlined by a glowing crescent of reflected sunlight hitting clouds above the South Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These photographs offer an implicit chastisement to the wild pop sci-fi imaginings of the past, but they are also fulfillments of the same urge to know what lies beyond our gravity-bound grasp. They are records of unusual ventures, magnificently achieved: they were taken by unmanned space probes and beamed back to Earth. These contraptions may not carry human life, but they are instruments of the extended human will and imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have sent these probing eyes catapulting in long orbits, sweeping past planets and their moons (as with the Galileo or Cassini missions), or (as with the Mars rovers) stubbornly exploring the planetary surface, or (as with Voyager 2) ultimately veering outward in silent millennial journeys through deep space. Arthur C. Clarke, after looking at some of these photographs, wrote in a foreword to Mr. Benson's 2003 book (''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes,'' Abrams), ''These images serve as a spectacular reaffirmation that we are privileged to live in the greatest age of exploration the world has ever known.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is a strange kind of exploration because so little of it reveals any human presence. These images have not only been captured by robotic probes, they also show (unlike those early sci-fi pictures) barren worlds. We are looking at fearsomely beautiful realms that seem to preclude life and disdain the human. Whatever their character -- ranging from the swirling random currents of Jupiter's atmosphere to the draftsmanlike elegance of Uranus surrounded by a scarcely visible halo of slight rings -- the harsh majesty seems to leave no room for a living presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet these are photographs. They present themselves to us as records of the real. They show us landscapes that the human eye might conceivably see. But we know too that they depict something we might never see. And some landscapes (like the surfaces of the Sun) we could never see. This mixture of the real and the imagined, along with these works' humanly inspired inhuman origins, conspire to create a strange photographic universe in which the human is everywhere implicated but nowhere sensed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though these pictures were captured without human intervention, almost none would look the way they do without elaborate human tinkering. Though they are photographs, they are not snapshots. Most at this exhibition would not exist without Mr. Benson's aesthetic labors; they are, in part, his creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is where this record becomes even more knotty. We have all, by now, seen the astonishing photographs from the Hubble Telescope with their vibrant portrayals of colliding galaxies and giant star clusters. You see similar moving images on planetarium domes: full-color displays of exploding crimson or yellow accompanied by sub-wooferish whooshes of sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, the colors are as phony as the sound. The Hubble pictures are all in black and white; colors are imposed to approximate hues suggested by frequency data. These tints are often exaggerated for dramatic effect or to create contrast. Even the image creators acknowledge they may not resemble what an eye in galactic space might see. Many are colorized far more radically than any 1930s movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson is more rigorous because he takes the human eye as a guide; he wants to show us what the eye would see if only it could. He immersed himself in the raw photo Web databases of NASA and the European Space Agency and then got to work, selecting, cropping, matching, shifting. He explains his approach in his book ''Beyond'' and on his Web site, but this should be demonstrated in the exhibition in far more detail; we really don't know how much was done to each image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black-and-white moon pictures from lunar orbiters of 1966 and '67, for example, originated on 70-millimeter film that was developed aboard the craft itself, then scanned and transmitted to Earth. What came back were not stunning vistas but scans of film strips. Fragmentary images had to be matched, gaps filled in, contrast adjusted. Many later pictures are also created out of mosaics: one view of Jupiter and Europa from 1979 was put together out of 60 pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Color was also an issue, as with the Hubble. ''Almost all of these photographs,'' Mr. Benson writes, ''required substantial amounts of digital processing. Many had never been rendered into color before, or if they had they'd long since vanished.'' In general, whether a spacecraft used video technology or digital sensors, three successive shots were taken in black and white, each using a different frequency filter, so color information might later be deduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the camera might be whipping by a planet at 35,000 miles per hour, these three raw images might not perfectly match. So Mr. Benson and his colleague, a planetary scientist and imagery expert, Paul Geissler, transformed them so they could be superimposed and used to create color pictures. In some cases color information was unavailable and had to be inferred from another mission's shots of the same landscape. The show's panoramic glimpse of a Martian dust storm, Mr. Benson explained in an e-mail message, took him months of work, drawing on about 100 images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is amazing that this process is as invisible as it seems here, and the results encourage trust in Mr. Benson's and Mr. Geissler's judgments. ''The solar system is already spectacular enough,'' Mr. Benson writes, ''without pumping artificial colors into it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course he is still creating many of these photographs out of data that would be far less impressive in its raw form. So these works are as much a record of Mr. Benson's explorations as the spacecraft's. And the care in which they are made ensures that however inhospitable to human visitation these worlds may seem, the pictures are a reminder of the crucial presence of human passion and perception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when American plans for human space travel seem to be at a standstill and NASA's mission confused, these haunting images captured by robotic probes paradoxically suggest that this won't truly be a great age of exploration until, despite harshness, costs and challenges, we again see the importance of human experience in space.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lakes of southern Titan are shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of Ontario Lacus, the largest lake in the southern hemisphere of this Saturnian moon, has fallen by some 15 feet over the last four years, causing its shore to recede by as much as 6 miles in some places. Other lakes nearby have similarly receded, according to radar measurements made by the Cassini spacecraft.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, if prolonged spells of 90-degree temperatures have you yearning for a refreshing icy dip, there are still plenty of bathing opportunities on Titan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course the lakes there are made of liquid methane -- and the 90 degrees of temperature are on the Kelvin scale, near enough to absolute zero to challenge even the most cosmically adept polar bear. The atmosphere is nitrogen and methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titan is the only body in the solar system other than Earth that has been found to harbor liquid on its surface, leading many planetary scientists and aspiring astrobiologists to speculate that the same organic chemical processes that led to life on Earth are occurring in a frozen slush of hydrocarbons on Titan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery that Titan's lakes are evaporating, at least in the Southern Hemisphere, where summer just ended, suggests that there are active weather and geological cycles on Titan analogous to those on Earth. But on Titan the liquid driving those cycles is not water but methane, explained Oded Aharonson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a wonderful opportunity and rare in the solar system to observe a planet with working liquid on its surface, a volatile agent that is responsible for altering its geology and participating in its weather cycle by evaporating and precipitating,'' Dr. Aharonson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research effort was led by Alexander G. Hayes, Dr. Aharonson's graduate student. Mr. Hayes was the lead author of a pair of papers, which will be published in Icarus and the Journal of Geophysical Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists have suspected that Titan might harbor exotic weather and chemistry ever since Voyager 1 flew by Saturn in 1980 and radio signals sent through Titan's atmosphere revealed a thick atmosphere of nitrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004 a camera known as the Imaging Science Subsystem on the Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn recorded a blurry image of what looked like a lake basin about the size of Lake Ontario through Titan's hazy atmosphere. That is now named Ontario Lacus. Since then an imaging radar on Cassini has been periodically scanning Titan's terrain, a few strips at a time, during close flybys of the moon. These scans showed smooth dark areas that few scientists doubted were lakes. In January 2005, the Huygens probe landed in what looked like a fluvial plain with channels carved by methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any lingering doubts were removed last year when Cassini's cameras recorded a glint of sunlight bouncing off Kraken Mare, a large lake-shaped basin near Titan's North Pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lakes appear dark on the radar because if they are deeper than about 25 feet the radar waves are completely absorbed and do not come back to the spacecraft. Mr. Hayes and his colleagues were able to gauge the drop in lake levels by simply noting the shrinkage of dark nonreflecting areas and combining that with measurements of the slope of the lake bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the edges of the lake, they could see the lake bottom and thus measure its depth from altimetry, performing what Dr. Aharonson said was the first extraterrestrial bathymetry. The depth results matched the lake shrinkage. Where the slope into the methane was slow and gentle, the lakeshore receded the farthest; where there was a quick drop-off, against some mountains along the northern shore, the lake receded little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should Titan be behaving like this? Dr. Aharonson said that a rough rule of thumb for hydrological systems like Earth or Titan was to expect that moisture would migrate seasonally from one hemisphere to the other, evaporating where it was summer and precipitating where it was winter. Indeed summer just ended in the southern hemisphere and the measurements show lakes were evaporating there, although there is no evidence that northern lakes are gaining yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the actual dynamics of the Titanium atmosphere, he said, can be much more complicated, leading to cycles tens or hundreds of thousands of years long in which one hemisphere or the other could be wetter or colder than the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the vagaries of its orbit around Saturn and Saturn's orbit around the sun, for example, Titan is closer to the sun during its southern summer than in its northern summer. As a result, southern summers are currently shorter and more intense than their northern counterparts. Dr. Aharonson and his colleagues argued in a recent paperthat this could cause liquid to collect more in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere, leading to a net migration of methane to the north over many Titan years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of migration could explain why the area covered by lakes in the north is about 100 times the area of all the lakes in the southern hemisphere. A similar cycle in the dynamics of the Earth's orbit around the Sun leads to what are known as Milankovitch climate cycles, thought to drive the ice ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence for this theory, Dr. Aharonson pointed out that the observed evaporation rate in Ontario Lacus, about three feet a year, is not enough to fill all the lakes in the north in one season, suggesting some longer term effect is at work. ''If we wait 15 years we won't see lakes migrate down to the south,'' he said. But if Titan has tens of thousands of years to move the methane from one hemisphere to the other, he explained, the rate can be much smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evaporation rate, he said, also sends a strong message about what the lakes are made of, namely pure methane, as opposed to heavier ethane or some other chemical, which is less volatile. ''In order to evaporate that much stuff, it has to be stuff that evaporates,'' he said. If there is ethane present it is well mixed, the lake is not coated with a layer of gunk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No tar balls on Titan. Yet.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A huge ball of brightly burning gas drifting through a neighboring galaxy may be the heaviest star ever discovered -- hundreds of times more massive than the sun, scientists said Wednesday after working out its weight for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those behind the find say the star, called R136a1, may once have weighed as much as 320 solar masses. Astrophysicist Paul Crowther said the obese star -- twice as heavy as any previously discovered -- has already slimmed down considerably over its lifetime.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it's burning itself off with such intensity that it shines at nearly 10 million times the luminosity of the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unlike humans, these stars are born heavy and lose weight as they age,'' said Crowther, an astrophysicist at the University of Sheffield in northern England. ''R136a1 is already middle-aged and has undergone an intense weight loss program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowther said the giant was identified at the center of a star cluster in the Tarantula Nebula, a sprawling cloud of gas and dust in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy about 165,000 light-years away from our own Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star was the most massive of several giants identified by Crowther and his team in an article in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other stars can be larger, notably the swollen crimson-colored ones known as red giants, they weigh far less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the mass of R136a1 and its ilk means they're tens of times bigger than the Earth's sun and they're brighter and hotter, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surface temperatures can surpass 40,000 degrees Celsius (72,000 degrees Fahrenheit), seven times hotter than the sun. They're also several million times brighter, because the greedy giants tear through their energy reserves far faster than their smaller counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That also means that massive stars live fast and die young, quickly shedding huge amounts of material and burning themselves out in what are thought to be spectacular explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest live only 3 million years,'' Crowther said. ''In astronomy that's a very short time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small lifespans are one of several reasons why these obese stars are so hard to find. Another is that they're extremely rare, forming only in the densest star clusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also have a limited range in which to look for them. In clusters that are too far away, it isn't always possible to tell if a telescope has picked up on one heavyweight star or two smaller ones in close proximity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, Crowther's team re-examined previously known stars to see if they could find an accurate measurement of their weight. The team reviewed archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope and gathered new readings from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope at Paranal in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists who weren't involved in the find said the results were impressive, although they cautioned it was still possible, although unlikely, that scientists had confused two very close stars for a bigger, single one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What they're characterizing as a single massive star could in fact be a binary system too close to be resolved,'' said Mark Krumholz, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both he and Phillip Massey, an astronomer with the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, also cautioned that the star's weight had been inferred using scientific models and that those were subject to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both scientists said the authors had made a strong case, arguing that the solar material being thrown off from feuding stars in a binary system would produce much more powerful X-rays than have been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowther acknowledged that R136a1 could have a partner, but he said it was likely to be a much smaller star, meaning that the star's its birth weight was still considerable -- perhaps 300 solar masses instead of 320.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its third swing past Mercury, NASA's Mercury Messenger spacecraft discovered an unexpectedly young lava plain, rapid rufflings of the planet's weak magnetic field and an unanticipated dance of elements in the thin atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the biggest surprise for the community is that the planet is turning out to be much more dynamic than people appreciated,'' said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington who is the principal investigator for the Messenger mission.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flyby occurred in September, when the spacecraft swooped within 142 miles of Mercury's surface at 12,000 miles per hour, but the findings of that flyby just appeared in three papers the journal Science published last week on its Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the 180-mile-wide double-ring Rachmaninoff crater, Messenger photographed flat, smooth plains that scientists interpreted as the hardened outflow of lava. Based on the number of smaller impact craters, the age of the volcanic deposits within Rachmaninoff is probably less than two billion years, said Louise K. Procktor of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the paper that examined the crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not recent, that would still suggest that Mercury was volcanically active well into its middle age, given that it formed 4.5 billion years ago with the rest of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is quite a big surprise,'' Dr. Procktor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury, not much more than 3,000 miles in diameter, is by far the smallest of the planets, and thus many thought it would have cooled off in less than a billion years. But Mercury's mantle may not rise and fall in convective patterns as in larger planets like Earth, and that may have kept the heat inside for more than two billion years. By imparting heat and relieving pressure, the impact of the meteoroid that formed the crater may have helped melt rocks that were already close to melting point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger's measurements also detected rapid fluctuations in Mercury's magnetic field as it shifted from one side of the planet to the other. Such fluctuations occur around Earth in a matter of hours. Around Mercury, the fields shifted in minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked as though we were seeing a complete collapse of the magnetic field,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''This is an incredibly dynamic magnetosphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third paper looked at Mercury's tenuous atmosphere, which consists of atoms knocked off the surface by sunlight, charged particles and dust-size meteoroids. One surprise was that near the equator, the concentration of calcium was higher near sunrise than sunset, but that effect was not seen for sodium or magnesium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because only calcium and not the other elements exhibits this behavior, ''We can't explain it,'' said Ronald J. Vervack Jr., another scientist at the Johns Hopkins laboratory and lead author of that Science paper. ''They just don't look the same, and they don't look the same anywhere we look,'' he said. ''Which is a bit puzzling, because we expected there to be some similarities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tail of sodium that had been seen behind Mercury during the first two flybys, in January 2008 and October 2008, was much diminished in the third flyby. The reason was that Mercury was in a different part of its elliptical orbit, and the resulting change in velocity diminished the power of sunlight that was sweeping the sodium atoms away from Mercury into the tail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A clearer picture should start to emerge next year. The spacecraft, launched in 2004, has been doing a gravitational do-si-do with the inner planets to slow down as it spirals inward and gets in position to enter orbit around Mercury in March.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Senate committee on Thursday unanimously agreed to a blueprint for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that cancels the agency's return-to-the-moon program, starts investments in commercial companies that could build rockets to take astronauts to low Earth orbit and speeds development of a heavy-lift rocket for more distant missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The compromise authorization bill approved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation bridges disparate proposals and outlines the tasks and budgets for NASA over the next three years. The bill has gained the support of both the White House, which was pushing for more aggressive changes under plans proposed by President Obama, and senators on the committee who had resisted those plans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The consensus we achieved today was a miracle, but I believe in miracles,'' Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the committee's space subcommittee, said after the vote. The bill now moves to the full Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee acceded on the cancellation of the Ares I rocket, which is part of the return-to-the-moon program known as Constellation, but called on NASA to start development of a larger heavy-lift rocket in 2011, likely to be based on shuttle components, that could be ready for launching by the end of 2016. The administration had proposed waiting until as late as 2015 to start work on a heavy-lift rocket, which would be needed for human missions to asteroids and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill also calls for development of a spacecraft capable of traveling beyond low Earth orbit -- almost certainly a continuation of the Orion crew capsule that is part of Constellation. The administration had originally wanted to cancel Orion and later proposed a stripped-down version as a lifeboat for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pay for Orion and the heavy-lift rocket, the Senate authorization slices much of the money the administration proposed for developing new space technologies and cuts the amount to be spent on the commercial crew program over the next three years, to $1.3 billion from $3.3 billion in the president's budget request. The budget request had sought $6 billion in total for commercial crew over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Nelson said the intent was that the administration would eventually get $6 billion, just spread over a longer period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill, known as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, would also extend the life of the International Space Station to 2020 and increase financing for earth science and aeronautics as requested by Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's total budget would follow Mr. Obama's request: $19 billion in 2011, $19.45 billion in 2012 and $19.96 billion in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some NASA critics had hoped the administration would continue to push for a more radical overhaul of the space agency, but the Senate committee bill ''really would accomplish the major shift that the president laid out in his plan,'' said Lori B. Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, in particular tapping commercial companies for the transportation of crew and cargo to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is way beyond what we had hoped for, the ability to come into agreement with Congress this soon,'' Ms. Garver said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Senate bill calls for adding one more space shuttle flight next year and leaves the door open for yet another flight by instructing NASA to refurbish an old external fuel tank that had not been planned for flight. A NASA official said this week that the tank could be refurbished by next October 2011, or about a year faster than earlier estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Senate's authorization bill covers only the next three years, it does not spell out how NASA could avoid a budget problem in later years as the development of the commercial crew vehicles and the heavy-lift rocket proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House of Representatives has yet to pass its version of the NASA authorization bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has been in limbo as the Obama administration has maneuvered to cancel Constellation while Congress mandated that work continue on the program until it agreed otherwise. In Congress, there has been a cacophony of divergent opinions. Some members wanted to continue Constellation. Others have pushed for extending operations of the space shuttles, now scheduled to be retired next year. A few liked the president's plan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON this Pacific outpost, 2,200 miles west of the South American coast, hundreds of us have gathered, exchanging warm greetings and catching up on life since we last saw one another -- in the Galapagos five years ago, or in Zambia nine years ago, or in Papua New Guinea 16 years ago. We are umbraphiles: having once stood in the umbra, the Moon's shadow, during a solar eclipse, we are driven to do so again and again, whenever the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun. In 1959, I saw my first eclipse. Sunday afternoon, I'll see my 51st.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some highlights from my log:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eclipse No. 1, 1959: Aboard an airplane flying over the Massachusetts coast. As the full Moon covered the Sun and the sky darkened to black, the Sun's corona outlined the Moon in white. I was hooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 3, 1970: In a cloudless sky over Miahuatlan, Mexico, south of Oaxaca. As eclipse darkness fell, the stars and planets came into view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 5, 1973: An extraordinary seven-minute eclipse north of Timbuktu, Mali. In Kenya, where we observed, it lasted five minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 12, 1983: Partly cloudy skies diminished visibility in East Java, Indonesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 19, 1992: I chartered a jet to fly an hour south of Cape Town, South Africa, and the view was clear and spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 23, 1995: In Rajasthan, India. The light dimmed eerily as the shadows sharpened. Next, the dazzling diamond-ring effect, as the last ray of sunlight shone through a valley on the Moon's surface, contrasting the lunar jewel with the still-faint solar corona forming the ring's band. A stunning red loop of gas appeared at the Sun's edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 29, 1999: West of Bucharest, Romania. Sunspots -- at the peak of their cycle that year -- made the corona bristle with giant streamers. We made great progress in our study of how the corona is heated to millions of degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 47, 2008: In Akademgorodok, outside Novosibirsk, Siberia. Sunspot activity was now low, and coronal streamers extended only from the Sun's equator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 49, 2009: From mountains outside of Hangzhou, China, we videotaped clouds passing the corona, adding a dramatic effect to the eclipse (even as it made our data harder to process).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My 51st experience will begin today at 2:08 p.m. local time (4:08 in New York).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're here for the science, yes. But there's also the primal thrill this astronomical light show always brings -- the perfect alignment, in solemn darkness, of the celestial bodies that mean most to us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when it's over we'll start planning for Australia (Nov. 13, 2012) and Gabon (Nov. 3, 2013). On Aug. 21, 2017, an eclipse -- my 60th? -- will cross the United States from northwest to southeast. May the clouds part then for all of us.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast in tone between the new national space policy unveiled by President Obama last week and the policy adopted by the Bush administration four years ago is striking. The Bush policy was jingoistic, unilateral in approach, and resistant to arms control in space. The Obama policy is cooperative, international in approach, and open to a verifiable arms control treaty to restrain the development of space weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of an arms race in space or a space-based conflict is not science fiction. China knocked down one of its own satellites in 2007, and the United States did the same the following year. (Beijing offered no explanation for smashing a weather satellite; Washington said it needed to destroy the disabled spy satellite before it tumbled to earth and vented its toxic fuel.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has a clear strategic interest in curbing the spread of weapons that could destroy satellites from the ground or from perches in space. A treaty is the best hope of doing that. The military relies heavily on communication and intelligence satellites -- more so than other nations' militaries. The American economy is also hugely dependent on satellite communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new policy states that Washington will consider arms control measures that are ''equitable, effectively verifiable and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies.'' Those are important conditions that should be possible for negotiators to meet. The policy also calls for ''openness and transparency'' in conducting operations in space, and for responsible behavior by all nations to help prevent ''mishaps, misperceptions and mistrust'' that could lead to conflict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any hawks who fear the administration may shrink from defending American interests in space ought to be mollified by assertions that all nations have the right to use space for national security activities and that the United States stands ready to defend its space systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new policy calls for wider international cooperation in exploring space, studying climate change, and tracking and removing orbital debris that poses a risk to spacecraft passing through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It reinforces President Obama's plan to rely more heavily on commercial companies to carry cargo and astronauts into low earth orbit, abandon another landing on the moon, and develop new technologies to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 and to the orbit of Mars by 2035. Many members of Congress are resistant, and the president will need to persuade them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its welcome call for international cooperation, the paper does not invite other nations to join in those trips to distant worlds. Any policy that purports to promote peaceful collaboration in space ought to enlist other nations in these challenging and costly missions.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dang. Nobody seems to remember any more that July 2, 1947 was the day of the Roswell crash in the New Mexico desert (a spacecraft from another world, say some; a test balloon, says the government) that became the touchstone for those who believe aliens have come to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they certainly don't remember that World U.F.O. Day is celebrated by some on June 24, to commemorate the first widely reported U.F.O. sighting by Kenneth Arnold, a pilot who claimed to see what he would call ''flying saucers'' over Mount Rainier the same year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From those days, our cultural love affair with little green men has gone through the stages of many passionate relationships -- the fear and hopefulness of ''The Day The Earth Stood Still'' in 1951; the quirky cuddliness of Ray Walston as ''My Favorite Martian'' in the '60s. We laugh, we cry, and then we scream again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Off screen, however, we seem to have drifted apart: sightings rarely capture the popular imagination. Now that cellphone cameras are all but ubiquitous, there isn't a moment that can't be snapped -- so if the truth really were out there, we'd see it. And we haven't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say that the number of sightings has dwindled. Groups like the National UFO Reporting Center receive hundreds of reports each month, and The Weekly World News supplies the latest in otherworldly headlines. (''Alien Tells Larry King to Leave CNN,'' the newspaper reported on June 29.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The community of sighters has really expanded through digital technology -- on a global basis,'' said Neil McGinness, the chief executive of Weekly World News. ''It really speeds up now because the chatter on the Web -- it just burns like crazy.'' And The Weekly World News, the happy home of Bat Boy and other paranormal stories, is happily receptive. Alien stories draw readers and reader comments -- ''probably more so than any other phenomenon,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, U.F.O. sightings rarely cause a stir outside of Mr. McGinness's pages or Web sites for buffs, says John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org. ''The 'Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky' no longer resonates with the public the way it did when a tricorder or talking computers seemed miraculous,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when incidents break out of the buff ghetto nowadays, smarty-pants killjoys often come up with perfectly reasonable explanations. Take the recent spiraling light over Australia, which many took to be a U.F.O. It was quickly tied to the launch of Falcon 9, the spacecraft created by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's company, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Plait, the creator of the debunk-eriffic Bad Astronomy blog at Discovermagazine.com, says that on the one hand, digital media ''may be hurting the cause of reality: such nonsense gets spread much faster than it used to.'' But ''it's easier for the correct explanation to spread as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that in March, people marveled at a bright object over Lake Erie and Cleveland. Mr. Plait wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Could it be an alien visitor from another world? No, I don't think so. In fact, I think it is another world. Venus, to be specific.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic problem, Mr. Plait said, is that people rarely look up into the dark sky and know what's normal, much less abnormal. The singer James McMurtry summed it up nicely in his song ''Levelland'':</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mama used to roll her hair</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back before the central air</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'd sit outside and watch the stars at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She'd tell me to make a wish,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd wish we both could fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't think she's seen the sky</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since we got the satellite dish. ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the odds are steeply against humans being the only life in the vastness of the universe. The blunt reality of distance measured in light-years, however, makes travel between the stars unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, we hold on to the mysteries left to us, savoring guilty pleasures like Larry King's alien (check the picture -- that could be a family resemblance) and not trying too hard to understand phenomena like the Marfa lights. On this planet, where a hole in the ground of our own making spews millions of gallons of toxic slush, surely it's O.K. to hope that there's intelligent life, well, somewhere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- The Japanese are calling it a miracle. The Hayabusa space probe returned last month from a seven-year, 382-million-mile round trip to an asteroid, giving a much-needed confidence boost to a country worried that its technological prowess might be waning.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Japan is still holding its breath. Did the mission accomplish one of its main objectives?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary tests on a capsule retrieved from the probe have shown no signs of the precious samples of the 4.6-billion-year-old asteroid that the Hayabusa was supposed to retrieve -- samples that scientists around the globe had hoped would hold new clues about the formation of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, known as JAXA, followed up with better news. Scientists had detected traces of vaporized material inside the container, some of it possibly from the asteroid, Itokawa, which goes around the sun on an elliptical orbit that crosses the paths of both Earth and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hayabusa capsule yields gas,'' declared one newspaper headline. ''Vapor gives us hope,'' read another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June 13 return of the Hayabusa, which drew heavily on Japanese industrial expertise, has fanned hopes that this nation has not lost its edge in technology and manufacturing. The American journal Science has called Hayabusa -- the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid and return to Earth, as well as the longest round-trip mission to outer space -- a ''trailblazer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese companies hope the mission can translate to sales in the steadily expanding market for space technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the nonprofit Space Foundation, based in Colorado, the commercial and governmental global market for satellites and other space infrastructure grew to $261 billion in 2009, up 7 percent from 2008 and 40 percent over the last five years. But Japanese companies so far have failed to gain much traction as prime contractors in the global satellite communications market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEC, which built the probe's advanced ion engines, wants to sell its technology in the United States, to NASA as well as to commercial customers through a joint venture with the American aerospace firm <span class="companylink">Aerojet</span>-General.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ion engines use electric fields, instead of chemical reactions, to propel rockets and satellites. They are less powerful but more efficient than conventional chemical engines and can last for years before running out of fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information technology behemoth Fujitsu, meanwhile, is aggressively marketing its communications systems, which are credited with guiding the Hayabusa spacecraft back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And IHI, which developed the probe's heat-resistance technology, says it hopes to build on the mission's publicity to double the revenue from its space-related business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An expert panel was appointed earlier this year to advise the government on ways to help double Japanese companies' earnings from their space businesses to at least 14 trillion yen ($158 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Achieving big goals is always accompanied with adversity, but where there's a strong will, there's a way,'' NEC's president, Nobuhiro Endo, said at a shareholders' meeting on June 22, showing off a scaled model of the Hayabusa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan, the fourth country after the United States, France and the former Soviet Union to put a satellite into orbit, in 1977, has since launched a string of successful rockets and has been intent on being a space power. But its aspirations have more recently been usurped by China, which put a man in space -- a feat Japan has not yet managed on its own -- and it has also incurred a series of setbacks, including a Mars probe launched in 1998 that failed to reach orbit around that planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency -- known as JAXA -- with a budget of about 230 billion yen for 2010 ($2.6 billion), is still relatively tiny compared with the United States' NASA and its $18.7 billion budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched on a Japanese rocket in May 2003, the Hayabusa (translation: peregrine falcon) had a benighted journey. After the probe landed in 2005 on the Itokawa asteroid, which is about a third of a mile long and shaped like a potato, its sample-capture mechanism went awry. To the public's dismay, JAXA officials said they were not sure whether any samples had been collected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, the probe's robotic rover, meant to take photos and temperature readings on the asteroid, inexplicably floated off into space and was never heard from again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse yet, after Hayabusa took off from the asteroid, all four of NEC's ion engines shut down. So did all 12 of the chemical-fueled rocket engines made by another space industry giant, <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</span>. The probe was left drifting in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, for more than seven weeks, for reasons still not clear, there were no communication signals from the probe. Public dismay quickly turned to derision and, eventually, indifference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 49th day of radio silence, the Hayabusa control room finally made contact with the probe, Junichiro Kawaguchi, the mission's leader, recalled in an interview. But scientists intent on remotely reviving the failed engines succeeded only in getting the undamaged half of one ion engine to work with the undamaged portion of a second engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Hayabusa limping along, JAXA had to drastically alter its original plan, which had called for the probe to approach Earth, eject its capsule of samples back into the atmosphere and then remain in orbit awaiting orders for a new mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the equivalent of only one full engine made it impossible for the probe to muster the propulsion to escape Earth's gravitational pull. The probe itself would have to re-enter the atmosphere in a ball of fire, with only the heatproof sample capsule surviving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could see the sparks as the probe disintegrated,'' Mr. Kawaguchi said of the June 13 re-entry. ''It was a miraculous return, yet I had very mixed emotions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Hayabusa's fiery return, three years later than the originally scheduled capsule drop, has generally been hailed as a national triumph. Fans flocked to public viewings, some decked out in handmade costumes meant to resemble the probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, as JAXA continues to slowly open and examine the capsule, officials say it will take months to determine whether it contains any asteroid samples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Japanese space experts choose to see the glass as more than half full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What Hayabusa has shown is the reliability of Japan's technology,'' said Hiroaki Akiyama, a specialist in planet geology at Wakayama University in western Japan. ''Traveling to the asteroid, making a landing and then returning to Earth is in itself a near miracle,'' he said. ''The return of the probe has proven that Japan's space program might not be big, but it is one of the most advanced in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fear lingers that after its million-mile errand of retrieval, the Hayabusa falcon has returned with empty talons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there are no meaningful asteroid samples, space enthusiasts fear that public disappointment could lead the government to slash spending on basic space exploration programs. Most directly at stake, as Tokyo tries to rein in public spending, is a second Hayabusa mission planned for around 2014 to journey to another asteroid -- this time in a search for water or organic matter -- looking for clues not just to the Earth's beginnings but to the origins of life itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democratic government, which took office in September and is now led by a new prime minister, Naoto Kan, is talking a fiscal hard line. The Democrats had threatened to scale back this year's approximately $1.9 million budget for the Hayabusa 2 program to less than $565,000, although Mr. Kan has recently said he will consider reviving financing for the next Hayabusa project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while initial polls after the Hayabusa's return showed renewed public support for increased space spending, doubts are already surfacing in the news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Apart from making it back to Earth, there aren't any results to show,'' the influential Nikkei Industrial Journal said in an editorial on Monday. ''With three out of four engines breaking down, there is no proof that the technology is reliable. And it's extremely suspect that any sand from the asteroid was collected -- the goal of the mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Kawaguchi, the Hayabusa project leader, and other space industry insiders say the real failure will come if Japan gives up so easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, there were problems, but we learned how to overcome those -- that's the whole point,'' he said. ''We've sent a message out to the world that Japanese technology still leads.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 7, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about Japan's Hayabusa space probe misstated the mission's precedents. The Hayabusa was the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid and return to Earth, and it was the longest round-trip mission to outer space and back. But it was not Earth's first visitor to an asteroid or the longest space mission yet. The article also erroneously attributed a distinction to Japan in placing a satellite in orbit. It was the fourth nation to do so, following the Soviet Union, the United States and France -- not the third. (It was third, after the United States and the Soviet Union, in placing a geostationary satellite in space.) The article also misstated, in some editions, the tardiness of the Hayabusa capsule's return; it was three years behind schedule, not two.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration on Monday unveiled a space policy that renounces the unilateral stance of the Bush administration and instead emphasizes international cooperation, including the possibility of an arms control treaty that would limit the development of space weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, both China and the United States have destroyed satellites in orbit, raising fears about the start of a costly arms race that might ultimately hurt the United States because it dominates the military use of space. China smashed a satellite in January 2007, and the United States did so in February 2008.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new space policy explicitly says that Washington will ''consider proposals and concepts for arms control measures if they are equitable, effectively verifiable and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration, in the space policy it released in August 2006, said it ''rejects any limitations on the fundamental right of the United States to operate in and acquire data from space,'' a phrase that was interpreted as giving a green light to the development and use of antisatellite weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy also stated that Washington would ''oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access or use of space,'' a phrase that effectively ruled out arms control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In secret, the Bush administration engaged in research that critics said could produce a powerful ground-based laser, among other potential weapons meant to shatter enemy satellites in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the Obama policy underlines the need for international cooperation. ''It is the shared interest of all nations to act responsibly in space to help prevent mishaps, misperceptions and mistrust,'' the new policy says in its opening lines. ''Space operations should be conducted in ways that emphasize openness and transparency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Marquez, director of space policy at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Monday that the policy was reverting to a less confrontational approach that the United States had championed in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The arms control language is bipartisan language that appeared in the Reagan policy and George H. W. Bush's policy and the Clinton policy,'' Mr. Marquez said in a White House briefing. ''So we're bringing it back to a bipartisan agreed-upon position.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Abramson, a senior analyst at the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington, said the new policy ''sets the stage for progress in space arms control -- without getting into specifics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, diplomats from around the globe have gathered in Geneva to hammer out a treaty on the ''prevention of an arms race in outer space,'' which would ban space weapons. Arms control supporters say that China and Russia have backed the process, and that the United States during the Bush administration dragged its feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, John Mohanco, a State Department official, told the diplomats in Geneva that as long as attacks on satellites remained a threat, ''our government will continue to consider the possible role that space-related weapons may play in protecting our assets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Obama administration has stopped the saber-rattling and started what might end in a new kind of peaceful accord -- though with plenty of caveats and vague conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the new policy calls on the United States to ''lead in the enhancement of security, stability and responsible behavior in space,'' it also says that any resulting arms treaties would have to be equitable, verifiable and enhance the security interests of the United States and its allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those are the gates,'' Mr. Marquez told reporters, ''that the arms control proposals must come through before we consider them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House said the State Department would make more details public in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama said in a statement that the new policy was ''designed to strengthen America's leadership in space while fostering untold rewards here on Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the civilian use of space, the policy, which is 14 pages long, puts renewed emphasis on the commercial space industry, reflecting the administration's desire to get the National Aeronautics and Space Administration out of the business of launching astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listed first among the administration's space goals is to ''energize domestic industries.'' That contrasts with the top goal of the 2006 Bush administration policy, to ''strengthen the nation's space leadership,'' and that of the 1996 Clinton administration policy, to ''enhance the knowledge of the Earth, the solar system and the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush policy asserted that the government would buy commercial services ''to the maximum practical extent'' and refrain from federal activities that would discourage or compete with commercial options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama policy retains those provisions and, in addition, calls on federal agencies to ''actively explore the use of inventive, nontraditional arrangements'' like creating public-private partnerships, flying government instruments on commercial spacecraft or buying data from commercial satellite operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial space section of the Obama policy also includes provisions for promoting American commercial space industry in foreign markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the Bush administration highlighted national security concerns, like preventing unfriendly countries from obtaining advanced technologies.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the political battle over the nation's space program, the first casualties are people like Donny Smith, an engineer who received his layoff notice Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been preparing, trying to find something else to move to,'' said Mr. Smith, who works for <span class="companylink">Bastion Technologies</span>, one of the companies NASA has hired to help design rockets to return astronauts to the moon as part of its Constellation program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers at Bastion and elsewhere are caught in a growing conflict between Congress, which has banned NASA from canceling any part of Constellation, and agency leaders who have directed program managers to scale back their work while preserving the parts that would fit into the new space policy proposed by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration wants to turn to commercial companies for taking future astronauts to orbit while taking a hiatus from any ambitious missions to send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit. Yet Congress has not agreed to the scuttling of Constellation and added a clause in this year's federal budget that prohibited NASA from canceling the program or starting a new one without Congressional assent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skirmishing continued in earnest this week. Staff members on the House Committee on Science and Technology are reviewing documents that NASA sent over Friday evening to comply with the committee's demand for information used in formulating the president's proposal. In addition, on Tuesday, 62 House members signed a letter sent to President Obama ''to express concern'' over the direction of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is in the nation's best interest to leverage the investments made in Constellation over the last five years, into a beyond low-Earth orbit exploration program, today,'' said the letter writers, which included representatives of both political parties from states far beyond Texas, Alabama and Florida, which are home to the major NASA centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basis for the latest Constellation upheaval is a clause in the contracts of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Pratt &amp;Whitney Rocketdyne</span>, which states that the companies are responsible for setting aside contract money to pay for termination costs if the Constellation program were canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to letters from NASA this year, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and Alliant, more commonly known as ATK, said that for decades the space agency paid for termination costs like severance pay for workers and that the companies had not reserved money to cover that. <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> has estimated its cancellation costs at $350 million, ATK at $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two contracts with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, another of the companies working on Constellation, were modified in late January so that NASA, not <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, set aside $81 million to pay for termination costs. Those changes were made less than two weeks before the administration announced its desire to cancel Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter this month to leaders of key Congressional committees, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, cited the Anti-Deficiency Act -- a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending more money than has been allocated by Congress -- in announcing that the agency was scaling back Constellation to cover termination costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, the prime contractor for the Orion crew capsule that Mr. Obama has proposed turning into a lifeboat for the International Space Station, threatened to shut down the program if it had to set aside the termination costs. NASA has now sped up payment of $80 million to the company and then added $83 million to the contract to help <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> manage the termination costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want these contractors to go out of business if we can,'' said Andrew Hunter, a NASA budget official. ''They were going to shut down work on the 27th. We're keeping them alive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK is still holding to the position that NASA is responsible for termination costs, and it has not aside money or prepared layoffs. As planned, ATK is receiving $160 million for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the infusion of money, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> is still moving 600 jobs off Orion, including 300 among its subcontractors. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has also announced that layoffs are in the works. And with the shifting of money among the prime contractors, NASA is cutting so-called support contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire layoff brunt so far is landing on people like Mr. Smith and not NASA government employees. In Huntsville, Ala., often called the Rocket City, Mayor Tommy Battle said he had heard that 700 people could be affected in his city. Nationwide, NASA has estimated that 2,500 to 5,000 jobs could be lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Bastion Technologies</span>, that means layoff notices went to 86 of the 190 employees working on the company's NASA contract for analyzing potential safety issues with the Constellation program's Ares rockets. Bastion's workers get 60 days' notice under federal law, but that law does not apply to all of the contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gives Mr. Smith time to look for work somewhere, but he is not optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the scope of the layoffs and the fact there are more than a thousand people out there now looking,'' Mr. Smith said, ''I really don't know.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are about to find out just how generous nature really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, astronomers operating NASA's Kepler spacecraft will release a list of about 350 stars newly suspected of harboring planets, including five systems with multiple candidate planets. That data could dramatically swell the inventory of alien worlds, which now stands at 461, none of them habitable by the likes of us.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers everywhere, who have been waiting since Kepler's launch in March 2009 to get their hands on this data, will be rushing to telescopes to examine these stars in the hopes of advancing the grand quest of finding Earthlike planets capable of harboring life out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a lot of attention has been paid in astronomical circles over the past few months to what the Kepler team will not be saying. By agreement with NASA, the team is holding back data on its 400 brightest and best planet candidates, which the astronomers intend to observe themselves over abusy summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's policy requires astronomers to release their data from instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope in a year, but the Kepler astronomers say launch delays and other problems robbed them of the observing time they needed to check out their planet candidates, which are only visible from the ground from April until September. An extension of the deadline is needed, they say, to guard against a flood of bogus claims -- ''false positives'' -- by other astronomers misinterpreting their data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I sent you 0's and 1's, it would be useless,'' said William Borucki, Kepler's leader, from the Ames Research Laboratory at Moffett Field in California. The public wants answers to the age-old question of whether the Earth is unique, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we say, 'Yes, they are small planets,' '' he went on, ''you can be sure they are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to hold back some data, reported on Nature.com, has divided astronomers. Some say say they do not begrudge the Kepler scientists -- who have in some cases devoted their careers to the project -- a few more months with their data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Kalas of the University of California, Berkeley, who used Hubble to take one of the first images of an exoplanet in 2008, said, ''The stakes aren't that high compared to human subject experiments, where a six-month delay has real consequences when therapies might become available for diseases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sequestering of the data, even temporarily, has irritated other astronomers, who believe that it is antithetical to the ideal of scientific openness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kepler was constructed and launched with a comparatively large sum of money for a project that is run by a single team,'' said Ben Oppenheimer, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, in an e-mail message. ''At this point, I have to say I do think they are being far too restrictive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B. Scott Gaudi, an astronomer and planet hunter at Ohio State University, said there were more planet candidates than the Kepler team members could check by themselves. ''They need help,'' he said. ''If they were more open they would be able to get more science out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then he added: ''Who am I to say this? I didn't put 10 years of my life into this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody denies that the stakes, both personal and institutional, are huge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first astronomer who can prove they found an Earthlike planet around an Earthlike star will win many kudos and prizes,'' said John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led a NASA advisory committee that approved the deal. ''It's glory for NASA,'' he added.''NASA would like to have one of its missions find an Earthlike planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of data -- who owns it and who gets to see it, and when -- has become one of the more contentious issues in science, scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, scientific data consisted of carefully inked notations in research notebooks, bound, with numbered pages, accumulating on a bookshelf in the office or lab, or photographic plates in yellowing envelopes sitting in a filing cabinet. And it was proprietary, meaning it was yours forever to publish or mull endlessly as you desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it often consists of billions or trillions of 1's and 0's reposing in vast digital archives, whose capacity is measured in terabytes or petabytes, buttressed by the giant computer programs that process it and the reams of ancillary information, dubbed metadata, that give it context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the era of the Web, all this information can be sent around the globe at the click of a mouse, retrieved and manipulated by anyone who wants to use it to better understand the nature of dark matter, argue about the safety or desirability of nuclear power, or decide how much salt to put in her food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Science is more and more living in a glass house,'' said Robbert Dijkgraaf, a physicist at the University of Amsterdam and co-chairman of the InterAcademy Council, a multinational organization of science academies that is reviewing the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the request of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led a National Academy of Sciences study last year that said rules for sharing data should be built into projects. In an interview, he said: ''The time has past when a bunch of elite true-meaning experts could go into the next room and make conclusions. They have to be transparent. That's a change in the culture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a shift in the balance between the duty of a scientist to wring every last drop of truth and credibility out of the data he or she might have spent years gathering and the rights of the rest of us to know what our tax dollars have discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Proprietary'' has become a four-letter word, said Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago who was part of the panel on research data. He said he worried that the pendulum had swung too far toward the Internet ideal of free information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secrets have been part of modern science since its beginning. Galileo reported his discovery of the rings of Saturn in an anagram that he wouldn't decode until he was sure that he wasn't seeing things. In the early 1960s, when radio astronomers discovered the powerful radio sources known now as quasars, they jealously guarded their coordinates, giving them to only a few trusted astronomers to investigate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The members of a scientific collaboration typically agree not to talk about their results before they have been officially released in a paper or a news conference, for example, upon pain of being kicked out. The Kepler team took this a step farther by signing formal nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, few areas of physical science have excited the public imagination in recent years as the search for planets around other stars, dubbed exoplanets. Most of them are giants like Jupiter in orbits broilingly close to their stars, but that is not surprising, since most of them were found by looking at stars that wobble under the influence of their planets; the wobble from big planets up close is much easier to detect than that of an Earth at a more temperate distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler employs a different approach, which Mr. Borucki has championed ever since 1984. It stares at a patch of sky in the constellation Cygnus, constantly measuring the brightness of 156,000 different stars looking for the small blips that would signal a planet's passing in front of its star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a sense, it's the most boring mission ever flown: doing the same thing every six seconds,'' Mr. Borucki said. The grand scientific goal of the project, a kind of cosmic census planned to go on until 2013, is to discover Earthlike planets in Earthlike places -- that is to say, in the not-too-cold, not-too-hot Goldilocks zones near a star where liquid water can exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki said the Kepler team started out with 12,000 suspicious dips. They laboriously whittled down those to 956 planet candidates, then quickly dismissed 204 as false positives. That leaves about 750 real candidates, some with supposed orbits of less than a day. Only about half of them, he suspects, will turn out to be real planets. The rest will be double stars, triple stars, starspots and other impostors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have dozens of ways of recognizing when it isn't a planet,'' said Mr. Borucki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realizing earlier this year that sorting them out would take more time than they had before the June 15 deadline, the Kepler team asked NASA for an extension. Jon Morse, director of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, referred the Kepler question to the astrophysics subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council, a group of 13 astronomers who serve as a go-between between the space agency and professional astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 12, the Kepler team presented the committee with four options. The most radical, and Mr. Borucki's favorite, was to hold back the data on 500 candidates until the end of the mission or until the planets had been verified. At the other end of the spectrum was an option to release everything on June 15, as originally planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Huchra of Harvard, who led the discussion, said, ''We all felt the sooner the data hit the streets the better,'' and in the end there were no votes for holding back candidate data until the end of the mission. ''If we had done that everybody would have been hung out to dry,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group settled on a compromise in which Kepler will be able to protect 400 planet candidates until Feb. 1 -- an extra eight months -- and an additional 100 from a second set of candidates in another data release in 2011. The extra time will in effect give the Kepler astronomers back the summer observing season they lost last year. The compromise, Dr. Morse said, was ''in the spirit of the regular release policy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the treasure hunt for the end to cosmic loneliness continues.''The public wants to know whether there is life on other planets,'' Mr. Borucki said, noting that it could take decades. The effort to get an answer, he said, reminds him of the building of the great cathedrals in Europe, in which each generation of workers had to tell themselves that ''someday it will be built.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a sense, we, too, are doing these things,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has greatly scaled back the work it will do in the coming months on its program to return astronauts to the moon, telling companies working on the program to set aside money to cover its potential cancellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes, which the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., described in letters to members of Congress on Wednesday, hobble the program, known as Constellation, possibly to a point beyond repair.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, NASA has spent about $10 billion on an effort to return astronauts to the moon. The Obama administration wants to cancel Constellation, arguing it is too expensive, but Congress has so far not agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In passing the current budget, Congress inserted a clause that prohibits NASA from canceling Constellation or starting up a replacement program without its approval. Critics of Mr. Obama's proposed policy say this week's moves are an effort to bypass Congress and kill the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised Constellation plans largely end work on the Ares I rocket that was to replace the space shuttles for taking astronauts to orbit, and scale back efforts on the Orion crew capsule, which was to ride atop the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the letters, General Bolden said remaining Constellation money would be focused on future development that could be transferred to the program Mr. Obama proposed in his 2011 budget. About one-third to two-thirds of the 7,800 contract employees working on Constellation could lose their jobs, NASA estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is a clause in the contracts of the prime Constellation contractors, which include <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>., or ATK, which says the contractors are responsible for cancellation costs. When asked about their termination costs this spring, however, ATK and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> said they expected NASA to pay for them, as had been past practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> has estimated its cancellation costs at $350 million; ATK at $500 million. In total, the companies' cancellation costs are expected to reach nearly $1 billion, NASA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They won't get more funds for that,'' said a NASA official who was not authorized to speak on the record. The official said the clause was standard in most federal contracts, and that NASA was not handling Constellation differently than other programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, another contractor, negotiated a clause that says NASA would pay for cancellation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the letters, General Bolden wrote that because of federal budget rules that prohibit agencies from incurring costs beyond what has been appropriated, ''NASA has no choice but to correct this situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, a former associate administrator for program analysis and evaluation at NASA and now director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said, ''In a brief check with people more knowledgeable than me, NASA has never held contractors' liable for termination liability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this is to be the new agency policy and practice, then NASA should shift responsibility for termination liability on all of its current contracts, not simply Constellation,'' Dr. Pace said. ''As it stands, this appears to be purposefully punitive against a specific set of NASA contractors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tussle over Constellation and the future of NASA will continue and will probably become more contentious. ''The administration is disregarding these policies with reckless abandon and doing so in a way that I find to be in complete violation of the legal parameters,'' said Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, where ATK is based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said Congress might write its own space policy. ''The White House didn't do the footwork to develop and sell its plan for human spaceflight,'' he said in a statement. ''Now it's locked in a stalemate with members of Congress who want to continue or restructure the Constellation program. That leaves NASA in limbo, which is exactly what Administrator Bolden's letter reflects.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GALVESTON, Tex. -- ''Game-changing'' and ''affordable'' are perhaps the most repeated adjectives spoken by NASA officials in the last few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise underlying President Obama's proposed space policy is that development of new space technologies can speed space exploration at lower costs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But skeptics in Congress counter that NASA has provided too few details to convince them that they should largely throw away the $10 billion that has been spent so far in NASA's Constellation moon program and spend billions more on something new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a workshop last month in Galveston, members of NASA study teams looking at how to put in effect the Obama policy presented their current thinking to 450 attendees from industry and academia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA presenters, in describing how the space agency could make it to Mars on a limited budget, said their ideas represented ''a point of departure'' that would be revised with feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new plans place a heavy emphasis on in-orbit refueling stations, which would reduce the size of rockets needed. For propulsion to Mars, the road map envisions a nuclear-powered ion engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some aspects remain fuzzy. Cristina Guidi, deputy director for NASA's Constellation systems division, who talked about future heavy-lift rockets, said NASA had not figured out how powerful a heavy lifter it needs for human missions beyond Earth orbit, much less a specific design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is also looking at a series of robotic missions, to the Moon, to asteroids, to Mars, that would gather data needed to set the stage for future astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing technology before deciding on a specific mission, however, leaves some worried that programs could fall victim to the type of budget cuts that have historically affected NASA's technology programs. For example, NASA's last effort to develop a nuclear reactor for spacecraft was canceled after only three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the proposed technology programs being considered are already facing cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has proposed continuing development of the Orion crew capsule, which was slated for cancellation with the rest of Constellation, as a lifeboat for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slimmed-down Orion would still cost $4.5 billion to complete, and that money would come at the expense of other items in the human spaceflight program. None of the cuts would come from the $6 billion proposed for the space agency's commercial crew initiative over the next five years, so much of the money is likely to come out of the technology programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans presented at the Galveston conference did not take Orion into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll just have to rebalance the whole portfolio,'' said Michael G. Conley, the study leader for NASA's so-called flagship demonstration projects, which include a prototype fueling station. ''I'm still optimistic we can do some things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A presentation on NASA's commercial crew plans suggested that the agency would give companies wide leeway, but would also require the work to be done at a fixed cost rather than the ''cost-plus'' contracts that govern most of NASA's current work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James S. Voss, vice president of space exploration systems at <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span>, which is developing a small spaceplane called Dreamchaser that would ride atop an Atlas V rocket, said that what he heard at the workshop ''was exactly what we were hoping for and working for.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- At the <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> factory here, the full-size space station mockups sitting on the warehouse floor look somewhat like puffy white watermelons. The interiors offer a hint of what spacious living in space might look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every astronaut we have come in here just says, 'Wow,' '' said Robert T. Bigelow, the company founder. ''They can't believe the size of this thing.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years from now, the company plans for real modules to be launched and assembled into the solar system's first private space station. Paying customers -- primarily nations that do not have the money or expertise to build a space program from scratch -- would arrive a year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, a second, larger station would follow. The two Bigelow stations would then be home to 36 people at a time -- six times as many as currently live on the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this business plan unfolds as it is written -- the company has two fully inflated test modules in orbit already -- Bigelow will be buying 15 to 20 rocket launchings in 2017 and in each year after, providing ample business for the private companies that the Obama administration would like to finance for the transportation of astronauts into orbit -- the so-called commercial crew initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's budget proposal for 2011 calls for investing $6 billion over five years for probably two or more companies to develop spacecraft capable of carrying people into space. Then, instead of operating its own systems, like the space shuttles, NASA would buy rides for its astronauts on these commercial space taxis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This represents the entrance of the entrepreneurial mind-set into a field that is poised for rapid growth and new jobs,'' Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in February. ''And NASA will be driving competition, opening new markets and access to space and catalyzing the potential of American industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials have been careful not to say their commercial crew plan relies on a market beyond NASA, but for now, Bigelow appears to be the only non-NASA buyer for commercial crew services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody,'' Mr. Bigelow said of competition he sees on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, the rosier promises of the president's plan rest on this enigmatic, 100-employee company located on 50 acres of desert not far from the casinos and strip clubs and the ability of Mr. Bigelow, an iconoclast who made his fortune in real estate including the Budget Suites of America hotel chain, to get his dreams off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has spent about $180 million of his own money so far and has said he is willing to spend up to $320 million more. An expansion of the factory will double the amount of floor space as the company begins the transition from research and development to production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow only occasionally gives interviews, and except for Michael N. Gold, the director of Bigelow's Washington office, the employees almost never speak publicly. A company document titled ''Some Important <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> Cultural Values'' implores employees, ''Keep your work and the work of your co-workers very private from people outside the company.'' (Mr. Gold said that the confidentiality stems from federal regulations designed to protect technological information and that the engineers are busy working.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Las Vegas site is hemmed by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soundness of the business case is unknown to outsiders. Mr. Bigelow declines to say if he has firm commitments from any countries or companies to rent space on his space stations. In recent years, he has played down the notion that he is building a space hotel for rich tourists, although he says space tourism could provide a part of his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Mr. Gold visited countries like Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, England and Sweden to gauge interest. A stay on a Bigelow station, including transportation, is currently priced at just under $25 million a person for 30 days. That is less than half the more than $50 million a seat that NASA is paying for rides alone on Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station. Doubling the stay to 60 days adds just $3.75 million more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a country or company willing to sign up for a four-year commitment, the lease for an entire six-person module would cost just under $395 million a year, and that would include transportation for a dozen people each year. ''You see why this is attractive for the sovereign client market,'' Mr. Gold said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bigelow prices are good through 2018, and Mr. Bigelow said the prices would drop by then if, as he expects, rocket prices drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very comfortable with our numbers,'' he said, although he declined to discuss the details. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which is the most optimistic in reducing launching costs, estimates that rides to space on its Falcon 9 rockets would be $20 million a seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to trust a little bit that we're making these investments because we think it's going to make sense economically at the end of the day,'' Mr. Bigelow said. ''We won't execute our business plan if those numbers aren't there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His space stations are not his only interest in space. ''I've been a researcher and student of U.F.O.'s for many, many years,'' Mr. Bigelow said. ''Anybody that does research, if people bother to do quality research, come away absolutely convinced. You don't have to have personal encounters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''People have been killed. People have been hurt. It's more than observational kind of data.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other views that run counter to mainstream science include a belief in the power of prayer and a disbelief in the Big Bang theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of inflatable spacecraft dates back almost to the beginning of the space age, solving a stubborn conundrum with putting stuff in space. Rockets are tall, but not particularly wide. With inflatable spacecraft, the structure can be packed tightly into the payload and then filled with air once in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Echo I and Echo II satellites, launched in 1960 and 1964, were large Mylar balloons. NASA commissioned Goodyear to build prototypes of an inflatable space station, which looked like a big rubber inner tube.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rubber space stations never flew, in part because of an obvious design weakness -- they could pop if hit by meteoroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea remained dormant until the 1990s, when NASA started exploring how to build living quarters for a human mission to Mars. William C. Schneider, then the senior engineer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, returned to the inflatable design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of rubber like the 1960s Goodyear design, Dr. Schneider used an airtight bladder surrounded by Kevlar straps. ''It dumps its pressure load into the straps,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''Those two together make a very efficient design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the straps, alternating layers of aluminized fabric and foam absorb and disperse the impacts of micrometeoroids, providing better protection than metal structures, Dr. Schneider said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though he was sure the design was sound, he built two prototypes of the TransHab module and demonstrated their resilience in a swimming pool and a vacuum chamber. ''People would think of it as a balloon,'' said Dr. Schneider, who now is a visiting professor at Texas A&amp;M University. ''In cases, it was six times as good as needed. It's absolutely verified.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the Mars plans were shelved as too expensive, and TransHab was reimagined as a crew quarters module for the International Space Station. Then the space station costs grew, and in 2000, Congress prohibited NASA from spending any more money on TransHab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow, 66, said that he was inspired by NASA's successes of the 1960s, culminating with the Moon landings, and that he always hoped to invest in space someday. He read about TransHab in 1998, and learning of the project's imminent demise, he established <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> in 1999 and bought an exclusive license to the NASA patents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schneider joined Bigelow as a consultant. The Bigelow designs are essentially very close to his NASA work, Dr. Schneider said, with some changes like replacing the Kevlar with Vectran, another bullet-resistant fabric. There are also some notable improvements like the addition of small windows, already tested on the Genesis I and II test modules that were successfully launched from Russia using converted ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He had great manufacturing capability,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''They have some real good engineers as well. I'm sure they will be very successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest hole in his plans, Mr. Bigelow said, is the one not entirely in his control: getting to and from the space stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while, Bigelow and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> were collaborating on a small capsule that would launch on an Atlas V rocket, which currently launches Air Force satellites and other payloads. <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> won the NASA contract for building the Orion crew capsule for NASA's Constellation program and dropped out of the work with Bigelow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mimicking the $10 million X Prize that spurred the development of the suborbital spaceplane SpaceShipOne, Mr. Bigelow offered $50 million to anyone who could build an orbital spacecraft. No one tried to claim the prize before it expired in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigelow is collaborating with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> using $18 million that NASA has provided for preliminary design of a commercial crew capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Reiley, the program manager at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> for the capsule, said he was not very familiar with Bigelow's space station plans, but was impressed with what Bigelow has contributed to <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s capsule. ''They're a lot more entrepreneurial than we are,'' Mr. Reiley said, ''and it's refreshing for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> spacecraft is ready by 2014, that is when the dance of Bigelow space station modules will begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A habitat called Sundancer, with an inflated volume of about 6,400 cubic feet, would launch first. A separate rocket would then carry two Bigelow astronauts to take up residence in Sundancer as additional pieces -- a second Sundancer, a larger habitat of about 11,700 cubic feet, and a central connecting node -- are launched. The modules are to dock by themselves with the astronauts present to fix any glitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the stations are up, Bigelow still needs to demonstrate that it can juggle the logistics of supplying food, water and air, as well as fix the inevitable glitches that will arise. Mr. Bigelow said that he would hire people with the needed experience and skills, and that space stations were not all that different from hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had four decades of serving people, tens and tens and tens of thousands of people, all over the southwest part of the United States,'' he said. ''I have four decades of building all kinds of things. The principles are the same.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a private company, Bigelow can operate space stations much more efficiently than NASA and its governmental partners can operate the International Space Station, Mr. Bigelow said. (Another of the company values declares: ''Make up your mind quickly. Don't take forever, people are waiting, the company is waiting, the future is waiting and time costs money.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's interest in inflatables has also been revived once again. Among several large technology demonstration projects proposed in the president's 2011 budget is an inflatable module for the International Space Station. Bigelow is currently talking to NASA about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow envisions variations of the inflatable modules being used for a Moon base or a mission to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our hope is that we can serve NASA,'' he said. ''Because we can do it so much more economically.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching was pushed back almost four hours after the countdown hit a few snags, including a delay to fix a problem in the rocket's self-destruct system and a last-minute abort, at 1:30 p.m., because of an engine reading outside the acceptable range. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> engineers reset the systems and resumed the countdown before the launching window closed at 3 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success was a major boon to those supporting President Obama's proposal to turn the launching of astronauts over to private companies. A spectacular failure would have provided ammunition to opponents who call Mr. Obama's approach too risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to overstate how impressive it is to do so much on the first flight, given the historic track record of new rockets,'' said John Gedmark, executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, who opposes the president's space plans, was not swayed. ''Make no mistake,'' she said in a statement, ''even this modest success is more than a year behind schedule, and the project deadlines of other private space companies continue to slip as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''This test does not change the fact that commercial space programs are not ready to close the gap in human spaceflight,'' with the space shuttles scheduled to be retired after two more flights and Mr. Obama proposing the cancellation of NASA's follow-on rocket program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzanne M. Kosmas, a Democratic congresswoman whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center and who has also been skeptical of the proposed NASA changes, issued a more complimentary statement: ''The successful test launch of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 rocket,'' she said, ''is a significant step in the development of the commercial space industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Kosmas argued that commercial rockets should be a complement to a NASA-led program, not a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debate on the future of NASA's human spaceflight program will continue through the summer as the administration and Congress try to arrive at a compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has tried to play down the significance of the first Falcon 9 launching. ''I hope people don't put too much emphasis on our success,'' Mr. Musk said Thursday at a news conference, ''because it's simply not correct to have the fate of commercial launch depend on what happens in the next few days. But it certainly does add to the pressure. There's more weight on our shoulders because of that. I wish there weren't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the flight, Mr. Musk said it was ''to a significant degree a vindication of what the president has proposed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is aiming to launch a second Falcon 9 this summer to demonstrate its capabilities for NASA before it gets the go-ahead to take cargo and supplies to the International Space Station. That flight will include an operational version of the Dragon capsule, which will hold cargo and, eventually, astronauts. That capsule would not go to the space station but would demonstrate orbital maneuvers and return to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third Falcon 9 flight has been pushed back about five months to March 2011 at the earliest. However, Mr. Musk said he would like to expand its objectives so that the Dragon capsule could go all the way to the space station, perhaps even carrying cargo. That objective had been scheduled for the fourth flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> won a $278 million contract from NASA in 2006 for the demonstration flights, and, if successful, it would move on to a $1.6 billion contract for 12 flights to take supplies to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's maiden flight held a mock-up of the capsule. The engines all appeared to fire properly, but the second stage started a slow spin that accelerated as it reached orbit, more than what was expected. ''We certainly want to investigate it carefully,'' Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only other aspect of flight that did not go quite as planned was the hoped-for recovery of the first stage, which was to descend by parachute into the water. ''The feedback we've gotten thus far is that the stage broke up on re-entry,'' Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has said it can build a version for astronauts in three years, once it has a contract.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- As the nation held its collective breath, China's first astronaut, Yang Liwei, floated back to the motherland, having orbited Earth 14 times in the Shenzhou 5, or Divine Capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was October 2003, and the national broadcaster CCTV carried live coverage of the momentous event, from Mr. Yang's famous pleasantries uttered in space -- ''I feel good'' -- to the instant that workers opened the capsule door to reveal the pale but smiling face of a hero, offering irrefutable evidence that China's maiden manned space voyage had gone off without a hitch.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or had it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a lecture he gave to a group of journalism students last month, a top official at Xinhua, the state news agency, said that the mission was not so picture-perfect. The official, Xia Lin, described how a design flaw had exposed the astronaut to excessive G-force pressure during re-entry, splitting his lip and drenching his face in blood. Startled but undaunted by Mr. Yang's appearance, the workers quickly mopped up the blood, strapped him back in his seat and shut the door. Then, with the cameras rolling, the cabin door swung open again, revealing an unblemished moment of triumph for all the world to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The content of Mr. Xia's speech, transcribed and posted online by someone who attended the May 15 lecture at Tianjin Foreign Studies University, has become something of a sensation in recent days, providing the Chinese a rare insight into how their news is stage-managed for mass consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titled ''Understanding Journalistic Protocols for Covering Breaking News,'' the speech was intended to help budding journalists understand Xinhua's dual mission: to give Chinese leaders a fast and accurate picture of current events and to deftly manipulate that picture for the public to ensure social harmony, and by extension, the Communist Party's hold on power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at Xinhua and Tianjin Foreign Studies University did not return calls seeking comment, making it impossible to confirm details of the talk, but many of the points Mr. Xia made are borne out in Xinhua's coverage of the events he discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it does not mention the staging of the landing for the cameras, Mr. Yang's autobiography, published this year, describes the injuries he suffered during the flight, including the cut to his lip caused by a microphone. He also says that the pressure from the infrasound resonance during takeoff was excruciating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of my organs seemed to break into pieces,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Xia's journalism lecture, accompanied by a PowerPoint demonstration, included other examples of Xinhua's handiwork, most notably coverage of ethnic rioting in the far west of China last summer that left nearly 200 people dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the transcript, Mr. Xia explained how Xinhua concealed the true horror of the unrest, during which the victims were mostly Han Chinese, for fear that it would set off violence beyond Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region. Uighur rioters burned bus passengers alive, he told the class, and they raped women and decapitated children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Under those circumstances, it would have exacerbated ethnic conflicts if more photos were released,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Xinhua also has another purpose -- intelligence gathering -- and two days later the agency's reporters sprang into action, leaving a government-organized media tour to sneak into a hospital to photograph the bodies of those slain during a wave of bloodletting by Han Chinese after the initial burst of unrest. Those deaths, he told the class, were reported to Beijing but did not make it into official news reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was after receiving such unadulterated ''internal reference news,'' he said, that President Hu Jintao flew home early from a meeting to deal with the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who often lays bare details of elements of Beijing's propaganda machine on the Web site China Digital Times, said the seeming frankness of Mr. Xia's words reflected how unapologetic Xinhua was in its mission and its methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's basically telling these students that journalism in China is a big show, it's fabricated, but in the end it's all justified for the higher purpose of stability,'' Mr. Xiao said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice of massaging the message has become more nuanced since the days when disfavored leaders were airbrushed out of group photos or details of a disaster -- like the extent of the damage caused by the 1976 earthquake in Tangshan that claimed a quarter-million lives -- could simply be kept from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Xinhua and the Communist Party's propaganda department to which it reports have become far more sophisticated, but the challenges they face have also become more daunting in the Internet age. Although government censors still require China's main news portals to carry Xinhua dispatches on delicate matters like street protests or official corruption, censorship is de facto far less comprehensive online than in traditional media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postings about Mr. Xia's journalism lecture were quickly deleted, for instance, but new transcripts kept appearing. By late Thursday, at least 50 accounts came up in a <span class="companylink">Google</span> search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Xiao, the fact that the original posting had appeared at all was encouraging and suggested that some Chinese journalism students were still idealistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Perhaps it shows that at least one of these young students was shocked by what he heard,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here was a model for the next great time machine, just over John Grunsfeld's shoulder in a field in Battery Park: a giant telescope that will be launched in 2014 and sent one million miles from Earth. By looking deep into space, it will collect light and images that have been traveling since nearly the beginning of the universe, and send them back here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld, trim and compact at 51, has floated in space for hours at a time, miles above the Earth, fixing the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, the mirrors on the Hubble were not working properly, and it was thought to be the world's highest and most expensive lemon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, when Dr. Grunsfeld and his colleagues finished their repairs, it was able to take pictures from billions of years ago. Scientific theories about the dawn of the universe and early galaxies had to give way to actual data from the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be 80 feet long, 37 feet wide and 40 feet high. The designers say it will be powerful enough to reveal the details on a penny at a distance of 24 miles. Light from the moon takes less than two seconds to reach Earth, 8.5 minutes from the sun and 55,000 years from close galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of looking at toddler pictures of the universe, we will be able to look at baby pictures,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''The Hubble has seen back 13 billion years, into galaxies 600 or 700 million years after the Big Bang. Hopefully, the Webb will get us back to 200 million years after the Bang.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb model will be on view in Battery Park until Sunday, as part of the city's World Science Festival. Other than throwing ticker-tape parades for astronauts and graduating smart kids from schools that specialize in science, the city rarely has much direct contact with the American space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday night, Dr. Grunsfeld, who retired as NASA's chief scientist at the beginning of the year, and other astronomers will set up 100 telescopes in Battery Park for star gazing. ''Saturn should be up'' then, he said. ''Saturn is a huge favorite of mine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its current state, the Webb model is not an especially graceful-looking structure, and it is hard to imagine how it will be able to travel a million miles. The bottom of it consists of a sun shade, an umbrella about the size of a tennis court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The umbrella will be closed up until it's finished traveling,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Then it will open up like origami.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of the sun shield is to keep the telescope cool; it will operate at 40 degrees Kelvin, or nearly minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Grunsfeld said. By way of comparison to suntan lotion, the umbrella will provide a sun protection factor of 1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the instruments together will use about the same amount of electricity as a hair dryer, and that will come from solar power,'' said Blake Bullock, a manager at <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>, the principal contractor building the telescope for NASA. ''Once it is out there, you will have these photons that have been traveling for 12 billion years without hitting anything until they run into'' the Webb telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars formed out of helium and hydrogen; nuclear fusion got turned on and created carbon and other elements; many explosions later, organic chemistry, life and humans came along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have zinc in our vitamins,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Why zinc? It comes from the supernova explosions. To account for what we're made of, you have to have three supernova explosions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE power of the telescope is that it can answer the deepest questions about how things came to be. ''We don't know why the Big Bang happened,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''In my job, I think about what happened right after that. But look at this: furry mammals on Earth can build a telescope that can look back to the beginning of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of hundred students gathered to look at the Webb model on Tuesday morning. Brian Greene, a physicist and author who is one of the organizers of the festival, asked those in the audience how many of them believed that there was life out there, beyond the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good majority of the crowd, students, teachers, scientists, raised their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Dr. Grunsfeld stood. How many, he wanted to know, believed that aliens from out there were walking the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, only a few raised their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there are aliens, they'll be here in New York,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 6, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The About New York column on Wednesday about the display at Battery Park of a model of a new space telescope misstated the age of John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut. He is 51, not 52. The article also misstated the amount of time it takes light from the moon to reach Earth. It is less than two seconds, not four seconds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember when we heard about the last solid rocket booster test firing, the last main engine test firing, the last tank manufacturing and now the last set of boosters coming to K.S.C.,'' said the shuttle's launch director, Michael D. Leinbach. ''Yeah, this has been 25 years of my life. It's very, very touching, a lot of emotions kick in.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach and about two dozen managers and engineers with NASA and <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, which builds the huge shuttle boosters near Promontory, Utah, accompanied the segments for the final 120 miles of their cross-country journey, sharing memories tinged with pride and sadness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Melancholy kicks in, a little bit of denial, probably,'' Mr. Leinbach said as the train rolled south from Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expressed concern about looming layoffs -- some 7,000 shuttle jobs are being eliminated at the space center alone -- and said, ''The thing that makes me most angry, and maybe 'disappointed' is a better word than 'angry,' is the fact that America's not going to be able to launch American astronauts on American rockets for many, many years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach was referring to the gap between the end of shuttle operations after two final flights and the debut of commercially developed rockets and capsules that are at the heart of the Obama administration's new space policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While supporters of the new plan believe private-sector rockets can be ready in three or four years, many agency insiders believe that such assessments are overly optimistic and that technical problems will inevitably delay whatever comes next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, NASA astronauts will be forced to hitch rides on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, at more than $50 million a seat, to reach the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is preparing the shuttle Discovery for launch in September or October to deliver supplies and spare parts to the space station. Endeavour is to go on the final mission late this year or early next to deliver a $1.5 billion physics experiment to the lab complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six booster segments delivered last week, along with two that arrived earlier, will be prepared for launch with Atlantis for an emergency rescue mission were Endeavour's crew to run into a problem preventing safe re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers and supporters in Congress are lobbying the Obama administration to launch Atlantis on a final space station resupply mission next summer if a rescue flight is not needed. By launching Atlantis with a reduced crew of four, a backup shuttle would not be needed. The astronauts could instead seek safe haven on the space station until returning aboard Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it makes sense,'' said Michael J. Massimino, a veteran astronaut. ''You've got to weigh it against the costs. So let the cost guys figure it out. But when they do, I think they'll see that it's worth it for us to fly it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two striking features on the Northern ice caps of Mars: a series of troughs that spiral outward from the center of the ice cap, creating the image of a pinwheel, and a canyon larger than the Grand Canyon. Since they were discovered in 1972, they have intrigued scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prevailing theory was that both features were formed through a process of erosion, after the ice caps were formed. In the case of the canyon, known as the Chasma Boreale, many believed it was created during a huge meltdown, like a subsurface volcanic eruption.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists have new evidence that both the canyon and the troughs were formed while the ice caps themselves were forming, not afterward. Their results are published in a pair of papers in the May 27 issue of Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous guesses were made using images taken of Mars's surface, but the new research uses images from orbiting radars that penetrate beneath the surface of the formations. Using these images, scientists determined that wind patterns shaped the way ice accumulated on the caps, creating the spirals and the canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the scientists hope to use the data to model climate patterns in Mars over time. This is one step in understanding an ancient mystery -- whether there is life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're going to look for life on Mars, then we need to understand where the water is, where it was, and what the temperatures have been,'' said Jack Holt, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, and an author on both papers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the Large Hadron Collider finally done its worst?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not by a long shot. This particular embodiment of cosmic hunger, in which space closes in on itself and time dies, heralds not the end of the world but only the beginning of the World Science Festival, the annual New York mash-up of science, art and culture. This black hole is the central menace in ''Icarus at the Edge of Time,'' a new musical work by Philip Glass based on a story by Brian Greene, the Columbia University physicist and festival co-founder. The world premiere of ''Icarus,'' complete with 62-pieces from the Orchestra of St. Luke's, images from the London artists Al and Al, and John Lithgow narrating, will anchor a gala celebrating science on Wednesday night at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yo-Yo Ma, among others, will be performing, but the star of the star-lovers will be Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University cosmologist who has done more than anyone else to explore, at least metaphorically, the nature of black holes. ''Hawking so fully embodies what the festival is all about -- courageous exploration of the unknown,'' Dr. Greene said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The festival runs through Sunday with 40 events in about 20 locations around Manhattan and -- new this year -- Brooklyn. It begins on Tuesday morning with the unveiling in Battery Park of a full-scale model of NASA's 80-foot-long James Webb Space Telescope, designed to be launched in 2014 to prowl the early years of the universe; it will be in place all week. Subsequent events include dance performances, panel discussions about the nature of reality and about animal intelligence, and group star-gazing along the Hudson River. One event sure to resonate because of recent headlines from the Gulf of Mexico features Fabien Cousteau, grandson of Jacques Cousteau, and the marine biologist Sylvia Earle, explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society, discussing the past and future of ocean exploration. Others will explore inner space. In ''Strangers in the Mirror,'' for example, Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and author who is pretty much a walking, talking science festival unto himself, and the painter Chuck Close, famous for his large-scale portraits, discuss their common malady -- an inability to recognize faces, including their own in a mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The festival culminates in a daylong science street fair in Washington Square Park on Sunday and a repeat of ''Icarus'' in the Skirball Center at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third annual World Science Festival, which was founded by Dr. Greene and his wife, Tracy Day, a former television producer, to reunite ''those long-lost lovers,'' science and art, in the words of Alan Alda, the actor and science buff who is their close co-conspirator. Already, however, the routine seems part of the fabric of the civic cosmos: bright red chairs, professional media-savvy moderators to stir the talk and steer it over rough spots, generous helpings of jazzy graphics and music, and long lines out the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by what it refers to as its ''founding benefactors'' -- the Simons Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation -- the festival has an annual budget of about $5 million, Dr. Greene said. This year the <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman Corporation</span>, the prime contractor for the Webb telescope, is a principal sponsor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the presence of Dr. Hawking suggests, this year's festival has a decidedly cosmic flavor. The Webb telescope model will preside over a star-gazing party hosted by, among others, John Grunsfeld, the former NASA astronaut and Hubble Space Telescope repairman, on Friday night. Telescopes will be available, or you can bring your own. Meanwhile throughout the week visitors to the Broad Street Ballroom in Lower Manhattan can hear what black holes might sound like as they are being formed. Astronomers hope to record them with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, a vast expanse of lasers and mirrors set up in Washington State and Louisiana to measure the twitching and pulsing of space-time in response to cosmic catastrophes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course there is the new cosmic ''Icarus.'' Dr. Greene said that the impetus for the updated version of the story, about a young man who flies too close to the Sun and so plummets to his death, came from his children's love of adventure stories, and his own feelings as a child about the fate of the original Icarus. ''To pay with your life for going against what you're told to do -- never liked it,'' he said in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new version the young Icarus is trapped on a spaceship in the middle of a multigenerational trip to another star. When the ship has to detour around an uncharted black hole, Icarus, a genius pilot and navigator, decides to go take a close look at it. He has carefully plotted a trajectory to avoid falling into the hole, but has neglected to take into account an important effect of gravity on time: a watch appears to move more slowly inside a strong gravitational field than outside it. Icarus avoids falling into the black hole, but when he runs thousands of years have gone by in what to him were a few minutes. The spaceship, with his father and everything else he ever knew, is long gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green originally envisioned his reimagining of the Icarus myth as a performance piece a la ''Peter and the Wolf,'' but ended up turning it into a book, which was published by Knopf in 2008 with Hubble photos. Now it has been reworked with a score by Mr. Glass, script by Dr. Green and the playwright David Henry Hwang, and visuals by Al and Al, the artists and filmmakers Al Holmes and Al <span class="companylink">Taylor of London</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was commissioned and co-produced by the World Science Festival and the Southbank Center in London, where it will be performed later this year as part of the 350th anniversary of the Royal Society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several festival programs will be streamed online. Ms. Day said that this was a way for the festival to reach across the nation and the world without becoming larger or more expensive. ''We don't want to expand our footprint,'' she said. ''We're big enough.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was buffeted with more criticism and skepticism before Congress on Wednesday as he sought to defend the Obama administration's proposal to revamp the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, the Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, said Congress had still not been told enough to make informed decisions about the president's plan to cancel the space agency's Constellation program that would send astronauts back to the moon and turn, instead, to private companies for transportation into orbit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far we have not seen any hard analysis from the administration that would give us confidence that it can be done for the amount budgeted,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In President Obama's budget request for the 2011 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, he called the Constellation program too expensive. The spending request added $6 billion over five years to NASA's budget, but the increase was directed to other areas of NASA like aeronautics research, climate research and robotic science missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech last month, Mr. Obama described ambitious goals for NASA: to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 and then to Mars a decade later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gordon noted that the administration's budget projections for what would be spent through 2025 on human spaceflight were far below what a blue-ribbon panel said last year was necessary for any program sending astronauts beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does no good to cancel a program that the administration characterizes as 'unexecutable' if that program is simply replaced with a new plan that can't be executed either,'' Mr. Gordon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional turmoil surrounded the Constellation program on Wednesday when its program manager, Jeffrey M. Hanley, was removed. In an e-mail message to his team, he said NASA headquarters had told him his services ''are no longer required, effective immediately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deputy program manager, Dale Thomas, was named acting program manager, and Mr. Hanley's new position is as associate director for strategic capabilities at NASA's Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the hearing, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, said the reassignment of Mr. Hanley made her ''personally very dubious'' of the pledge by NASA's head, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., that the agency would diligently continue work on Constellation until Congress approves any changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his April speech, Mr. Obama tried to assuage criticism that he was not interested in human spaceflight by announcing the continued development of the Constellation program's Orion crew capsule. It was to take astronauts to the moon, but is now envisioned as a lifeboat for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said at the hearing that the Orion lifeboat would cost $4.5 billion over five years to develop, not including the cost of launching it to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokeswoman said later that none of the financing for the Orion lifeboat would come from the $6 billion allocated to the commercial crew program, and that the offsetting funds would come from elsewhere in the human spaceflight program.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking over manual control 50,000 feet above the Florida spaceport, Capt. Kenneth T. Ham of the Navy, the commander, guided the 105-ton space plane through a sweeping right overhead turn before a steep descent to Runway 33.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just shy of the runway threshold, Captain Ham pulled the shuttle's nose up, Cmdr. Dominic A. Antonelli of the Navy, the pilot, deployed the ship's landing gear and Atlantis swooped to a picture-perfect touchdown at 8:48 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston, Atlantis, we have wheels stopped,'' Captain Ham radioed a few moments later as the shuttle coasted to a stop on the runway centerline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sure the station crew members hated to see you leave, but we're glad to have you back,'' Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines replied from mission control in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts, including Captain Ham; Commander Antonelli; Michael T. Good, a flight engineer and retired Air Force colonel; Garrett E. Reisman; Piers J. Sellers; and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen of the Navy, doffed their pressure suits and joined NASA managers and engineers on the runway for a walk-around inspection before returning to the crew quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She looks great,'' Commander Antonelli said of the Atlantis. ''From the condition we brought her back in, she is so ready to get stacked and back out to the launch pad. You can tell that's where she wants to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a busy week docked to the International Space Station, the astronauts installed a Russian research module, delivered several tons of supplies and carried out three spacewalks to install a backup Ku-band antenna, an equipment mounting platform and six new solar array batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the final planned mission for Atlantis as NASA phases out the shuttle program after three decades and more than 130 flights. Only two more missions are planned, a flight by Discovery in September or October and a final flight by Endeavour late this year or early next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Atlantis will be processed for launch on a possible rescue mission in case of any major problems that might prevent Endeavour's crew from making a safe re-entry. And while there are no official plans to actually launch Atlantis, NASA managers are seeking permission from the Obama administration to send the shuttle back up on one final mission to resupply the space station. A decision is expected later this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis blasted off on its first flight, a classified military mission, on Oct. 3, 1985. Among the highlights of its quarter-century of service were the launchings of robotic probes to Venus and Jupiter, the deployment of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite, five military missions and seven flights to the Russian Mir space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis also flew 11 missions to the International Space Station and visited the Hubble Space Telescope last year for a final overhaul.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of amateur sky watchers has pierced the veil of secrecy surrounding the debut flight of the nation's first robotic spaceplane, finding clues that suggest the military craft is engaged in the development of spy satellites rather than space weapons, which some experts have suspected but the Pentagon strongly denies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the unmanned successor to the space shuttle blasted off from Florida on its debut mission but attracted little public notice because no one knew where it was going or what it was doing. The spaceship, known as the X-37B, was shrouded in operational secrecy, even as civilian specialists reported that it might go on mysterious errands for as long as nine months before zooming back to earth and touching down on a California runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews and statements, Pentagon leaders strongly denied that the winged plane had anything to do with space weapons, even while conceding that its ultimate goal was to aid terrestrial war fighters with a variety of ancillary missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secretive effort seeks ''no offensive capabilities,'' Gary E. Payton, under secretary of the Air Force for space programs, emphasized on Friday. ''The program supports technology risk reduction, experimentation and operational concept development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secretive flight, civilian specialists said in recent weeks, probably centers at least partly on testing powerful sensors for a new generation of spy satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the amateur sky watchers have succeeded in tracking the stealthy object for the first time and uncovering clues that could back up the surveillance theory. Ted Molczan, a team member in Toronto, said the military spacecraft was passing over the same region on the ground once every four days, a pattern he called ''a common feature of U.S. imaging reconnaissance satellites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In six sightings, the team has found that the craft orbits as far north as 40 degrees latitude, just below New York City. In theory, on a clear night, an observer in the suburbs might see the X-37B as a bright star moving across the southern sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This looks very, very good,'' Mr. Molczan said of the identification. ''We got it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In moving from as far as 40 degrees north latitude to 40 degrees south latitude, the military spacecraft passes over many global trouble spots, including Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Molczan said team members in Canada and South Africa made independent observations of the X-37B on Thursday and, as it turned out, caught an earlier glimpse of the orbiting spaceship late last month from the United States. Weeks of sky surveys paid off when the team members Kevin Fetter and Greg Roberts managed to observe the craft from Brockville, Ontario, and Cape Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Molczan said the X-37B was orbiting about 255 miles up -- standard for a space shuttle -- and circling the planet once every 90 minutes or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fair amount is known publicly about the features of the X-37B because it began life 11 years ago as a project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which operates the nation's space shuttles. The Air Force took over the program in 2006, during the Bush administration, and hung a cloak of secrecy over its budget and missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X-37B has a wingspan of just over 14 feet and is 29 feet long. It looks something like a space shuttle, although about a quarter of the length. The craft's payload bay is the size of a pickup truck bed, suggesting that it can not only expose experiments to the void of outer space but also deploy and retrieve small satellites. The X-37B can stay aloft for as long as nine months because it deploys solar panels for power, unlike the space shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Weeden, a former Air Force officer now with the Secure World Foundation, a private group based in Superior, Colo., said the duration of the X-37B's initial flight would probably depend on ''how well it performs in orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office leads the X-37B program for what it calls the ''development and fielding of select Defense Department combat support and weapons systems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Payton, a former astronaut and senior NASA official, has acknowledged that the spacecraft is ultimately meant to give the United States new advantages on terrestrial battlefields, but denies that it represents any kind of space weaponization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 20, two days before the mission's start, he told reporters that the spacecraft, if successful, would ''push us in the vector of being able to react to war-fighter needs more quickly.'' And, while offering no specifics, he added that its response to an ''urgent war-fighter need'' might even pre-empt the launching of other missions on expendable rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he emphasized the spacecraft's advantages as an orbiting laboratory, saying it could expose new technology to space for a long time and then ''bring it back'' for inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission control for the X-37B, Mr. Payton said, is located at the Air Force Space Command's Third Space Experimentation Squadron, based at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. He added that the Air Force was building another of the winged spaceships and hopes to launch it next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current mission began on April 22, when an Atlas 5 rocket at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida fired the 5.5-ton spacecraft into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks rocket launchings and space activity, said the secrecy surrounding the X-37B even extended to the whereabouts of the rocket's upper stage, which was sent into an unknown orbit around the sun. In one of his regular Internet postings, he said that appeared to be the first time the United States had put a space vehicle into a solar orbit that is ''officially secret.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said many aerospace experts questioned whether the mission benefits of the X-37B outweighed its costs and argued that expendable rockets could achieve similar results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure it's nice to have,'' he said. ''But is it really worth the expense?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weeden of the Secure World Foundation argued that the X-37B could prove valuable for quick reconnaissance missions. He said ground crews might rapidly reconfigure its payload -- either optical or radar -- and have it shot into space on short notice for battlefield surveillance, letting the sensors zoom in on specific conflicts beyond the reach of the nation's fleet of regular spy satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he questioned the current mission's secrecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think this has anything to do with weapons,'' Mr. Weeden said. ''But because of the classification, and the refusal to talk, the door opens to all that. So, from a U.S. perspective, that's counterproductive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also questioned whether the Pentagon's secrecy about the spacecraft's orbit had any practical consequences other than keeping the public in the dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If a bunch of amateurs can find it,'' Mr. Weeden said, ''so can our adversaries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 30, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about suspicions that the Air Force's X-37B, the nation's first robotic spaceplane, is involved in the development of spy satellites rather than space weapons misspelled the surname of a former Air Force officer who said that the secrecy surrounding the current mission is counterproductive. He is Brian Weeden, not Weedon.</p>

In rover local time, that is 2,246 Sols, or Martian days. That surpasses the mark of 2,245 Sols set by the Viking 1 lander, which set down on Mars on July 20, 1976, and operated until its last transmission in November 1982.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought we'd get six months out of them,'' said Steven W. Squyres, an astronomy professor at Cornell, and the principal investigator for the rovers. ''Six years? No.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity could retroactively lose the longevity title to the Spirit, which landed three weeks earlier than the Opportunity. But the Spirit dropped out of touch March 22 when, because of the cold short days of winter, its solar panels could no longer generate enough power, and its batteries drained too far for it to keep in touch with controllers back on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spirit had gotten stuck months earlier and was unable to drive out or even position its panels toward the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission managers hope and still expect to hear from the Spirit again, perhaps as soon as September or October. The winter solstice on Mars passed on May 12, and the days on Mars are now lengthening for the rovers. The Spirit, if it revives, would continue scientific studies as a stationary station, observing weather and wobbles in the planet's rotation.</p>

Bada, 67, is the distinguished professor of marine chemistry at the University of California, San Diego. He studies how life began. We spoke for an hour during the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in San Diego last winter and again this month by telephone. An edited version of the two conversations follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No. When I started in graduate school in 1965, I had ideas about becoming a theoretical chemist, applying quantum mechanics to chemistry. But when I arrived at U.C.S.D., I met Stanley Miller, who'd been a student of Nobel Prize-winning chemist Harold Urey. In 1953, they completed the classic experiment on the chemical origins of life. They'd taken gases present on the early Earth like methane, ammonia and hydrogen and applied a spark discharge to them, to mimic lightning. From that, they produced amino acids, the compounds that make up the proteins in all living organisms. It was a stunning discovery. So when I met Stanley, I was hooked. I switched my thesis to work with him. My Ph.D. idea was to move the spark discharge experiment a step forward by studying amino acid stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. WHY WAS STABILITY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Because, in the turbulent environment of the early Earth, if an amino acid had been too unstable it would have decomposed. There would have never been enough of it to make up what we call ''the prebiotic soup,'' the molecular ingredients of life. So I suggested this one set of reactions that might constrain their decomposition, and then, in the lab, we did an experiment, which worked the first time we tried it. We were able to show some of the conditions that would allow amino acids to exist for longer time periods. And this allowed us to understand what types of amino acids may have been present on the baby Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DO WE KNOW HOW THEY BECAME LIFE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are closing in on that question. The Earth had to cool down enough for water to appear. Water allows molecules to dissolve and interact, which is why it is essential to life. We do know that we went from simple molecules to more complex molecules and eventually to RNA, which evolved into DNA. This took about a billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The missing piece of the puzzle is that intermediate phase between the amino acids and the RNA phase. We know that RNA is too complex to have arisen out of the simple molecules of the primordial soup. We can surmise that this intermediate form was able to make copies of itself to pass onto the next generation. Over time, mutations occurred and those mutants with survival advantages thrived and on and on until you eventually got to the complex RNA world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. IS THIS SAME PROCESS AT WORK SOMEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE NOW?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The chemistry we see in the lab is universal chemistry. It takes place anywhere you have the ingredients and conditions. We know that it happened, partially, on some of the meteorites that have come to earth. Amino acids have been found inside some of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. SO WE'RE PROBABLY NOT ALONE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I don't want to say ''we'' because people immediately think of something like a human being. But life as we know it -- a self-replicating system -- is probably not unique to the Earth. Under the right conditions, with the right chemistry, it can happen. There may be simple chemistry happening on Titan, a moon of Saturn. Some people think it could be happening on the satellites of Jupiter. There are compelling reasons to think that Mars was wet when it was young and that the raw materials for life could have been there. We don't know how far it progressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DID YOU SUPPORT FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S PLAN FOR MANNED TRAVEL TO MARS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm glad the Obama administration appears to be canceling it. Until we know whether or not life existed on Mars, putting humans there is premature. We'd contaminate the planet. All we'd see is human microbes and refuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. ON THE OTHER HAND, STEPHEN HAWKING THINKS EXPOSURE TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE COULD PROVE HAZARDOUS TO EARTHLINGS. ''IF ALIENS VISIT US, THE OUTCOME WOULD BE MUCH AS WHEN COLUMBUS LANDED IN AMERICA, WHICH DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS,'' DR. HAWKING RECENTLY WARNED. IS HE ONTO SOMETHING?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Dr. Hawking suggests an intriguing possibility, although there are alternative scenarios. Aliens might bring some exotic organisms with them to Earth, but would they survive in our oxygen-rich environment long enough to do any damage to humans or the ecosystem? Meteorites from Mars have landed on Earth throughout history, and if any Martian organisms were hitchhiking on these, they have not killed us yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. THREE YEARS AGO, YOU REDID THE SPARK DISCHARGE EXPERIMENT. WHY?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Actually, we didn't redo it -- we reanalyzed it. When, in 1999, Stanley had a stroke, he donated everything in his office to my laboratory. Eight years later, I was giving a talk in Texas and someone there told me that he'd once seen the extracts of the 1953 experiment in a cardboard box in Stanley's laboratory. Stanley had kept them for all those decades! Though we were very close, he'd never told me about it. I suppose it was just old business to him. But when I got back to San Diego, I asked my staff, ''When we moved everything from Stanley's office, did we get a little cardboard box?'' And someone said, ''Yeah, its right over there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there it was! Inside, were all these tiny glass vials carefully labeled, with page numbers referring Stanley's laboratory notes. I was dumbstruck. We were looking at history. It immediately hit me that when Stanley had first done the experiment, analytic tools were still very, very primitive. We have instruments today that are a billion times better. So we then reanalyzed the original materials with the modern tools. And lo and behold, we found that the spark discharge experiment had actually made about 30 compounds. Stanley had shown they'd made only five!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DID YOUR ANALYSIS CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE EXPERIMENT? THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO STILL DOUBT IT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Oh, yes. And more! It showed how easy it was to make a huge number of compounds. What was really interesting was the Murchison meteorite, which fell to earth in 1969, was originally thought to contain maybe 75 amino acids. Three years ago, when we compared the distribution of amino acids in the discharge experiment, they were uncannily similar to those in the meteorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would have loved to have told Stanley about this. But sadly, he was completely incapacitated by the time we found the samples. He died shortly thereafter. I would have loved to have said to him, ''Look Stanley, your experiment duplicated what happened on Murchison and you didn't know it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR OTHER SCIENTISTS TO REVISIT OLDER EXPERIMENTS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Listen, I was very fortunate to have had a mentor who had the foresight to preserve his experimental materials. Nonetheless, he couldn't anticipate all the changes that came with modern analytical chemistry. Today, we are seeing an explosion of knowledge due to new techniques. We ought to use them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was just an article in the journal PNAS about how new methods further characterized the compounds in Murchison. Up to now, we knew of hundreds in it. Yet, because of new techniques, they've found tens of thousands. And that made me think that yes, we ought to redo the spark discharge experiment. I suspect we'd also find tens of thousands of molecules that were in the prebiotic soup. That, hopefully, is the next project we'll be pursuing.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket that President Obama wants to kill is not dead yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers in charge of the rocket, the Ares I, which is part of the program to send astronauts back to the moon, have put together an ambitious testing program to accelerate its development, including a flight in November 2014 with astronauts aboard.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be four months earlier than NASA's current schedule, which calls for the first manned flight in March 2015, and much faster than the 2017 date predicted by a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays and rising costs are the primary reasons the Obama administration cites for its desire to kill the moon mission and turn over to private companies the business of launching astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But loud objections have come from some members of Congress, particularly those in Texas, Florida and Alabama, the homes of the NASA centers undertaking most of the development work for the moon program, known as Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, in a speech at the Kennedy Space Center, President Obama modified his proposal, originally unveiled in February, and called for continuing the development of the Orion crew capsule that was to ride on top of the Ares I, but only as a stripped-down lifeboat for the International Space Station. The Ares program would still be canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey M. Hanley, the Constellation program manager, said in an interview that given the uncertainty of what might emerge in the final budget, ''we felt it prudent to continue to operate in the program as if the program were to continue.'' He described that possibility as ''the unlikely case.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas R. Cooke, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems, said Mr. Hanley was not subverting the White House and NASA leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until Congress passes the president's proposed 2011 fiscal year budget that restructures the Constellation program,'' Mr. Cooke said in a statement, ''Mr. Hanley is obligated by law to comply with the fiscal year 2010 Appropriations Act, which requires planning for the future of the Constellation program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hanley described the proposal, first reported last week by the Web site NASASpaceFlight.com, as ''a fairly rigorous planning exercise'' that would be refined through the summer. The plan also outlines how the Ares I could evolve into a heavy-lift rocket by around 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I is to be a two-stage rocket, with the first stage consisting of a stretched version of the solid rocket boosters used to launch the space shuttles, and the second stage powered by an updated version of the engines from the second and third stages of gigantic Saturn V rockets. The Orion crew capsule is to sit on top of the second stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prototype of the Ares I, called Ares I-X, flew last October, but critics dismissed it as a public relations sham, because the first stage consisted of a standard shuttle booster rather than the stretched version, and the second stage and the crew capsule were hollow mock-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The testing plan is similar to what has been advocated by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. On Friday, Mr. Nelson, who was attending the launching of the space shuttleAtlantis, said, ''If I had to guess right now, I'd say that the Senate is going to come out with some continued testing for an Ares I-X vehicle, to keep the options alive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest version of the plan, a second flight test, with a fully developed first stage but still a dummy second stage, would launch in March 2013. Mr. Hanley said that flight could include a high-altitude test of the launching abort system that is designed to pull the crew capsule away from the rocket in case of trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abort system was successfully tested this month at the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The test article last week came back so clean that we are studying whether or not we could possibly reuse it,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''That would save us some money and some time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, in March 2014, a third flight test with a powered second stage would send a functional but empty Orion capsule into orbit. The Orion would circle the Earth for five days before splashing down in the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight months later, a fourth flight with astronauts aboard would launch and dock with the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have not settled or finalized any of those plans,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''This is still a study we're doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hanley said the schedule could be sped up by reducing some of the ground testing of pieces like the second-stage engine and by simplifying somewhat the Orion capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt that accepting perhaps a little more risk, but certainly getting flying and getting real flight experience with this hardware, was going to be a more effective approach in the long run,'' Mr. Hanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan gives nods to the priorities outlined in the proposed Obama administration space policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the three additional fight tests, the Ares I would be used only ''if needed'' to take astronauts to the space station, according to a presentation last month. The plan also casts the flight tests as a progression leading to heavy-lift rocket for missions beyond Earth orbit, and it de-emphasizes the original goal of landing on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of building the behemoth Ares V envisioned by the current Constellation program, the plan looks to develop a smaller heavy lifter that uses the same second stage as the Ares I. The first stage would consist of two of the stretched solid rocket boosters strapped to a core cylinder with additional engines, similar to what was planned for the Ares V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the simplified heavy-lift rocket would not be as powerful, ''That system could lob the Orion around the moon,'' Mr. Hanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hanley said he did not yet have estimates for how much this test program would cost. ''That's what's going on through the summer,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged that his efforts were somewhat at cross-purposes with those of his bosses, who are trying to convince Congress that Constellation is unworkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really have to leave it to them to sort out with the national leadership,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE crowd, all facing the same direction, waits nervously. Some fiddle with cameras on tripods while others sit in camp chairs, slapping at mosquitoes and checking their cellphones for updates. A voice comes over a loudspeaker: ''T minus 9 minutes and counting.'' After hours of excruciating anticipation, the final checks for the space shuttle launching have been made and all systems are go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents chase after small children dressed up in orange astronaut suits who can no longer contain their excitement. There is a collective gasp at T minus 2 minutes, 55 seconds, when the so-called ''beanie cap,'' or oxygen vent arm, retracts, making it appear that the shuttle is tipping its hat in farewell. T minus zero and there is a brilliant burst of billowing flame and a thunderous roar that shakes the ground and vibrates vital organs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectators gape with unblinking eyes and dropped jaws. Awestruck, many forget to take pictures. As the shuttle climbs into the air, there are whispers of ''Oh, my God,'' along with a few incredulous profanities. As it recedes from sight, leaving behind a spiraling contrail, there are finally cheers and some tears along with hugs and slaps on the back. ''Did you see that!'' exclaimed more than one viewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space shuttle launching is an unforgettable and intense experience, and there are just two more opportunities to feel the rush. The program will end this year after 29 years and 134 missions, so if watching a launching has been on your to-do list, start planning now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just make sure those plans are flexible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launchings are scrubbed 60 percent of the time because of weather or a technical issue -- sometimes with just minutes left in the countdown. Indeed, the final ones from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida were originally scheduled for July 29 and Sept. 16, when the Endeavor and Discovery, respectively, were to rendezvous with the International Space Station. But a recent change to an experiment planned for the Endeavor has pushed that one back to November. (The Discovery date, for now, is still on track.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to be flexible and grit your teeth if it doesn't happen when you thought it was going to happen,'' said Todd Sears, a chief financial officer for a commercial real estate company in Indianapolis. He traveled with his wife and their two children to see a shuttle launching last August, which was postponed daily for five consecutive days before it finally blasted into orbit. ''I was tempted to give up, but once I saw the shuttle on the launch pad with all the spotlights on it, I knew I had to see it go up,'' he said. ''It was absolutely worth the hassle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sears was fortunate to see it from the Kennedy Space Center Causeway, seven miles from the launching pad on the other side of the Banana River. It is the closest public viewing area and offers an excellent, unobstructed vantage. The effect is magnified by the river's reflection of the fiery rocket boosters. Tickets sell out within minutes of going on sale, typically three to six weeks before a launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another viewing option is from the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, about the same distance from the launching pad as the causeway. Tickets are easier to come by, but with trees and power lines partly in the way, you have to wait for the shuttle to climb some distance before getting a clear view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the shock waves are just as resonant. And with the simulcast on jumbo video screens, a countdown clock and astronaut appearances, the whole thing has a campy vibe reminiscent of New Year's Eve in Times Square. A similar experience can be found at the Astronaut Hall of Fame, in Titusville, about 12 miles from the Kennedy Space Center. But the view from there is no better than a spot along the side of the road, where there is no admittance fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portions of the Beach Line Expressway, otherwise known as State Road 528, that cross the Indian and Banana Rivers offer as good a view. There are decent sightlines, too, off U.S. 1 along the Indian River and on State Road A1A along the Atlantic. Some landowners on those roadways may charge parking fees of $20 for a car and $30 for a van.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Space View Park in Titusville, less than 15 miles from the shuttle launching pad, directly across the Indian River, probably offers the best view beyond the confines of the Space Center. Shuttle spotters start arriving about 12 hours early to stake out a spot. The park turns into a patchwork of blankets and sleeping bags as people nap, play cards and picnic while they wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim McGiness, a retired chemical engineer from Midland, Mich., has witnessed two shuttle launchings, one from the causeway two years ago and another from Space View Park last month. He said he thoroughly enjoyed both. ''It's impossible to describe how tremendous and fantastic it is to see in person,'' he said. ''Television doesn't come close to capturing what it's like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. McGiness and Mr. Sears stayed at hotels in Orlando, about 44 miles from the Kennedy Space Center, during their visits. Despite the distance, Orlando may be the best bet for accommodations. Titusville, about 10 miles from space center, is a small, sleepy and, some might say, seedy town with a handful of not too luxurious motels and hotels that jack up their prices whenever there is a scheduled shuttle liftoff. And don't expect much more than fast food for dining options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cocoa Beach, 19 miles away, is where NASA engineers, astronauts and their families tend to stay. The town has a larger selection of accommodations and restaurants, but it isn't a dream destination either (read: crowded, touristy and tacky) and there, too, prices are astronomical during shuttle launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are options for activities if a launching is delayed. The area around the Kennedy Space Center features the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Canaveral National Seashore. But most people who travel to see a launching are oblivious to anything other than finding a good spot to watch the liftoff and hear the sonic boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You come and camp and pray, 'Please go up, please go up,' '' said Mary Beth Ford, a mother of two from Lorida, Fla., who has seen two shuttles go up in the last two years, from Space View Park. ''And when it finally does, the ground shakes and you get goose bumps and realize nothing is impossible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU GO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tickets to view a launching from the Kennedy Space Center Causeway ($56; $46 for ages 3 to 11), the Visitor Complex ($38 and $28) and the Astronaut Hall of Fame ($17 and $13) are available by phone (866-737-5235) or at kennedyspacecenter.com three to six weeks before a launch, and they sell out quickly. You can sign up for an e-mail alert to know when they will go on sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tour operators offering viewing packages include Florida Dolphin Tours (floridadolphintours.com) and Gator Tours (gatortours.com), with prices starting at $115 for adults, and $105 for children. The package includes Kennedy Space Center Causeway tickets as well as round-trip transportation from Orlando area hotels.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR centuries, speculation about the existence of life elsewhere in the universe was the preserve of philosophers and theologians. Then, 50 years ago last month, the question entered the scientific sphere when a young American astronomer named Frank Drake began sweeping the skies with a radio telescope in hopes of picking up a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization. Initially, his quest was considered somewhat eccentric. But now the pendulum of scientific opinion has swung to the point where even a scientist of the stature of Stephen Hawking is speculating that aliens exist in other parts of our galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is predicated on the assumption, widely held today, that life would emerge readily on Earth-like planets. Given that there could be upward of a billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone, this assumption suggests that the universe should be teeming with life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the notion of life as a cosmic imperative is not backed up by hard evidence. In fact, the mechanism of life's origin remains shrouded in mystery. So how can we test the idea that the transition from nonlife to life is simple enough to happen repeatedly? The most obvious and straightforward way is to search for a second form of life on Earth. No planet is more Earth-like than Earth itself, so if the path to life is easy, then life should have started up many times over right here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Searching for alternative life on Earth might seem misconceived, because there is excellent evidence that every kind of life so far studied evolved from a common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. Yet most of the life that exists on Earth has never been properly classified. The vast majority of species are microbes, invisible to the naked eye, and scientists have analyzed only a tiny fraction of them. For all we know, there could be microbes with other ancestral origins living literally under our noses -- or even inside our noses -- constituting a sort of shadow biosphere, containing life, but not as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The denizens of the hidden ''alien'' biosphere -- let's call them Life 2.0 -- might employ radically different biochemical processes than the life we know and love. Microbiologists could easily have overlooked their existence, because their methods are focused on the biochemistry of standard life. Obviously, if you go looking for A, you will find A and not B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to go about tracking down Life 2.0 is to make educated guesses about what its biochemistry might be like. Alternative microbes might, for example, have different chemical elements. One shrewd suggestion, made by Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the United States Geological Survey, is that phosphorus -- crucial to life as we know it -- could be replaced by arsenic. She and her colleague Ron Oremland are dredging bugs from arsenic-contaminated Mono Lake in California in search of arsenic life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other researchers are focusing on the handedness of molecules. In standard life, the key amino acids are always left-handed, and the sugars are right-handed. Scientists are not sure why standard life has made this particular choice; nonliving chemical mixtures tend to contain equal amounts of both left- and right-handed molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If life started again, perhaps it would select different handedness for its key molecules. Should a shadow biosphere of ''mirror microbes'' exist, the organisms could be identified by culturing microbial samples in ''mirror soup'' -- a cocktail of nutrients with the handedness reversed, available from commercial suppliers. Standard life would find the soup unpalatable, but mirror life would thrive on it. Some experiments along these lines are being carried out at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, in Huntsville. Ala.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life 2.0 would be easier to identify if it inhabited distinct niches beyond the reach of regular life. Microbes are known to dwell in the superheated water around volcanic vents in the deep ocean, for example. Others survive extremes of cold, salinity, acidity or radiation. Yet all these so-called extremophiles that have been investigated to date are the same life as you and me. Regular life is clearly very hardy and adaptable, and can tolerate amazingly harsh conditions. Nevertheless, there will be limits. If Life 2.0 has a different chemical constitution, it may lurk in pockets at even more extreme temperatures or higher levels of radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An argument often given for why Earth couldn't host another form of life is that once the life we know became established, it would have eliminated any competition through natural selection. But if another form of life were confined to its own niche, there would be little direct competition with regular life. And, in any case, natural selection doesn't always mean winner-takes-all. Some years ago it was discovered that simple microbes actually belong to two very distinct domains -- bacteria and archaea. Genetically, these groups differ from each other as much as they differ from humans. Yet they have peacefully co-existed in overlapping habitats for billions of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If my theory turns out to be correct, it will have sweeping consequences. Should we find a second form of life right here on our doorstep, we could be confident that life is a truly cosmic phenomenon. If so, there may well be sentient beings somewhere in the galaxy wondering, as do we, if they are not alone in the universe.</p>

Armstrong, the most famous man in the history of NASA and the first man to walk on the moon, on Wednesday sharply criticized President Obama's plan to cancel the space agency's program to send astronauts back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the leadership we have acquired through our investment is allowed simply to fade away, other nations will surely step in where we have faltered,'' Mr. Armstrong said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. ''I do not believe that would be in our best interests.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Armstrong; Eugene A. Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17 and the last man to walk on the moon; and James A. Lovell Jr., the commander of Apollo 13, wrote a letter last month that called the proposed changes to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ''devastating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cernan also testified on Wednesday. He told the senators that the three men had carefully chosen the words in the letter: ''slide to mediocrity'' and ''third-rate stature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did not want to be misunderstood nor did we want to be misinterpreted,'' Mr. Cernan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama administration officials -- including John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser, and Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, who both also testified on Wednesday -- insist they are not abandoning human spaceflight. Instead, they said that by relying on commercial companies and developing new technologies, NASA would end up with a more affordable and more sustainable way of getting people to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite briefings from NASA officials last week, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Cernan have yet to be convinced that Mr. Obama's plan will succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I find a number of assertions, which, at best, demand careful analysis and, at worst, do not deserve any analysis,'' Mr. Armstrong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cernan spoke even more sharply, calling Mr. Obama's proposal ''a blueprint for a mission to nowhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cernan told the senators: ''Now is the time for wiser heads in the Congress of the United States to prevail. Now is the time to overrule this administration's pledge to mediocrity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Armstrong criticized the secrecy that surrounded the Obama space plan and said he had yet to find anyone who knew about it before it was made public in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lack of review normally guarantees that there will be overlooked requirements and unwelcome consequences,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Mr. Armstrong spoke was almost as remarkable as what he said. In the 41 years since Apollo 11, Mr. Armstrong has hidden from his fame, rarely appearing in public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cernan said that during the briefing from NASA officials last week, General Bolden had said NASA might have to subsidize the commercial providers in order for them to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can say with authority, because I wrote this down and I put the word 'wow' right next to it,'' Mr. Cernan said. ''Because Charlie did say, 'It may be a bailout like GM and Chrysler. As a matter of fact, it may be the largest bailout in history.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's budget calls for investing $6 billion over five years for private companies to develop launching systems for astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden, who testified before Mr. Cernan, was not able to respond directly, but Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, had asked him about the quotation without saying it had been noted by Mr. Cernan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said he did not remember making such a remark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview Tuesday, General Bolden said of the hearing: ''I'm not trying to take Neil Armstrong on. Neil is absolutely right. We have got to continue to pursue human space exploration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added, ''The manner in which we do it is probably where we differ, and it's because I don't think they had a full understanding of the difficulties the Constellation program is experiencing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What compromises emerge is still uncertain. Some members of Congress want to extend the flying of the space shuttles, slated to be retired after three more flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, chairman of the commerce committee and a self-described skeptic of human spaceflight, said, ''There are other people looking for a third way, and I guess I'm in that category.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The decline of basic research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration jeopardizes the agency's ability to study and explore the cosmos, a review panel of scientists and engineers said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings could bolster the arguments of the Obama administration that NASA's current effort to send astronauts back to the Moon is too expensive and is siphoning too much money from other programs. The president's $19 billion budget for NASA in the 2011 fiscal year would cancel the Moon program, known as Constellation, and replace it with the development of technologies intended to achieve a cheaper, more sustainable approach for sending people into space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report from the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded that research laboratories at the 10 NASA centers for studying materials, aeronautics and other basic science were merely ''marginally adequate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 80 percent of the laboratories are more than 40 years old, and deferred maintenance costs have swelled to $2.46 billion this year, from $1.77 billion in 2004. As a result, the report said, the agency is less able to tackle challenges encountered by its space and aeronautical missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That doesn't mean it's going to die tomorrow, but it's certainly not in strong, healthy shape,'' said Joseph B. Reagan, a co-chairman of the panel. ''I think if it kept going at the current rate, in five years the research community would not be able to support NASA's long-term goals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, NASA has one of the fastest computers in the world at its Ames Research Center in California. But officials at Ames, which is in the earthquake-prone Bay Area, have been unable to afford a $15 million uninterruptable power supply for the supercomputer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they were to lose power and lose cooling capability, they could fry that whole system, and they'd be out of business,'' said John T. Best, the committee's other co-chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aeronautics research has suffered in particular, with financing dropping by nearly half over five years, to $500 million in 2009 from $962 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Reagan said basic research made up only a small slice of NASA's budget. ''They could easily restore the balance between basic research and development activities,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report does not recommend specific financing increases for basic research. But Dr. Reagan said, ''The funding is not that large that's needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the administration's proposal, much of the Constellation money would be diverted to other areas of NASA, including those that the research council found to be underfinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the proposed cancellation of Constellation has met with skepticism and opposition from some members of Congress, who say it is too vague and too risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lester L. Lyles, a retired Air Force general who served on a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program, echoed those sentiments last week. In a letter to Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican and one of the critics of President Obama's space plans, General Lyles worried that the president's plans swung the pendulum too far the other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes no more sense to have a NASA with an under-emphasis on human spaceflight than it did to have a NASA with an over-emphasis,'' General Lyles wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter, also signed by Raymond S. Colladay and Len Fisk, two other aerospace experts, called on NASA and Congress ''to define and develop a human spaceflight program that does not re-inflict damage on the breadth of NASA's activities and that serves the nation well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter writers, however, did not spell out what they thought what the answer should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who is retired from the Marine Corps, said he generally agreed with General Lyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I appreciate what he says,'' General Bolden said Tuesday at the Langdon Education Campus in Washington, where he was talking to a class of fifth graders as part of National Lab Day. ''There is concern among a lot of people that the pendulum not swing too far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden, along with John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser, faces another turbulent day in front of Congress on Wednesday, testifying before the Senate Science, Commerce and Transportation Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also scheduled to appear at the hearing are Neil A. Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, during Apollo 11 in 1969, and Eugene A. Cernan, the last man to walk on the Moon, during Apollo 17 three years later. Last month, the two astronauts, along with James A. Lovell Jr., the commander of Apollo 13, wrote a letter that said the changes to NASA would be ''devastating.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, a crew of six, including two veteran astronauts, descended to Aquarius, an undersea laboratory next to a coral reef about three miles off Key Largo, Fla.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the 14th mission in a nine-year-old program known as NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations -- Neemo for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During their two weeks in the laboratory, the aquanauts will go on simulated spacewalks, operate a crane and perform other tasks of the sort astronauts would face in setting up a habitat on another planet. ''The primary objectives are based on engineering and testing and operations design for planetary exploration,'' said William Todd, the project manager for the Neemo 14 mission. (It does not look like the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico will affect Neemo.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts of the mission seem quaintly out of date, given the current turmoil enveloping NASA's human spaceflight program. One of the mock-ups is of the S.U.V.-size Lunar Electric Rover, which may never be built because the Obama administration has proposed scuttling NASA's Constellation program to send astronauts back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Todd said the tasks were more important than the details of the mock-ups. For example, crew members will test procedures for transferring an injured colleague into and out of the rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to have a lander and a rover and ways to get off those landers and ways to deal with incapacitated crewmen regardless of the destination,'' Mr. Todd said. ''We have to understand how to operate in those environments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By adjusting the buoyancy of the diving suits, the aquanauts can feel as if they are walking in the one-sixth gravity of the Moon or the three-eighths gravity of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Chris A. Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut who flew two shuttle missions, is leading Neemo 14. Crew members include Dr. Thomas H. Marshburn, who flew a shuttle mission last year; Andrew Abercromby, deputy project manager for the lunar electric rover; and Steve Chappell, a research scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two technicians will provide engineering support for the Aquarius lab, which is owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For half of the mission, a 20-minute lag time will affect all communications between the aquanauts and mission controllers on the surface. This would mimic the transmission delay between Earth and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay not only requires the crew to work more on its own but also fundamentally changes the nature of communications. Mr. Todd said that when delays were used in the last Neemo mission three years ago, NASA found that while video transmissions worked for general messages, written instructions worked best for the details, to reduce the possibility of misunderstandings. ''Those are important lessons,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Neemo aquanauts practice for what the future might look like, NASA's present will continue to unfold above. On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is scheduled to hold a hearing on the future of the human spaceflight program. The administration's plan has not garnered much visible support in Congress, but neither have many lawmakers come to the defense of Constellation. Neil A. Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, is expected to testify against the Obama proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the space shuttleAtlantis is to make its last scheduled launching from the Kennedy Space Center for a 12-day mission to the International Space Station to replace solar panel batteries, install a backup antenna and attach a Russian module filled with supplies. After the Atlantis mission, the other two shuttles -- Discovery and Endeavour -- are each to make one more flight, and then all three are to be retired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that last flight may turn out not to be the last. The Atlantis will be prepared for another flight, to serve as a rescue vehicle if the Endeavour were to encounter problems on its last mission, and the hope of some is that, if Endeavour's flight goes well, the Atlantis could fly one last mission.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hey, the future looks good, huh?'' says Ken Larson, jumping to center stage at the new Exploration Space exhibition here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Larson's job is to inspire the next generation as much as he was inspired -- by his father, a reporter who befriended the first astronauts, and by his grandmother, one of the first 10 employees here at what one plaque calls ''the hot burning center of American dreams.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center is cooling, though. The space shuttles are scheduled to retire this year and instead of replacing them with new rockets for a return to the moon -- the plan under President George W. Bush -- President Obama wants NASA to focus on the long-term challenge of reaching deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, the United States will no longer be sending its own astronauts through the stratosphere. Instead, they will hitch rides with the Russians until around 2016, when private companies start carrying NASA astronauts and other passengers into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, if Congress goes along. Several senators, including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, have already pledged to save the rocket program, Project Constellation, arguing it is vital for space, security and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here at the Kennedy Space Center, the celebration of the future now comes with asterisks. At the visitor's center, for example, which draws 1.5 million people every year, caveats have been forced into an extravaganza built for maximum wow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Larson's script, for instance, now includes this lawyerly line: ''We can't confirm exactly where humankind's next steps in space are going to take us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explicit references to Project Constellation have mostly been stripped out, with a few telling exceptions, like the metal sign near a trash can in the food court. And the moon has gone from a hot goal to a hypothetical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the video games at the center of Exploration Space, those who joystick their way to a safe landing hear, ''As soon as NASA starts a lunar program again, we'll send you an application.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is partly a product of unfortunate timing. Exploration Space, the most recent addition to the visitor's center, welcomed its first guests in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months later, the new Obama plan surfaced, forcing changes to Mr. Larson's script after what a spokeswoman described as ''tweaks to the messaging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Foster, a no-nonsense fifth-grade teacher from Emerald Shores, Fla., said she had hoped for more. She recalled the rush of early space flight, of the ground shaking like sand on a busy clothes dryer, while she watched from nearby as American pioneers bolted toward the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Foster said she hated the idea of relying on others -- especially the Russians -- to get to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mostly though, she worried that her students would never share her own wide-eyed experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know where we're going to get the inspiration for the children,'' Ms. Foster said in a visit last week. ''What are we going to do to get them excited to be engineers and pilots?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visitor's center tries. There is a feel of don't-you-get-it admonitions in the 3D Imax movie that includes Leonardo DiCaprio's asking, ''Will we ever find anywhere as perfect as our planet earth?''; and in the nine billboards at the entrance that tell visitors space exploration is ''a destiny, not a destination'' because ''it is the driving force of ingenuity'' that ''fuels our economy'' and ''creates the passion to pioneer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, the president told a crowd at the space center that he, too, was ''100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.'' He highlighted a proposed $6 billion increase in NASA's budget over five years, and plans to save local jobs by refurbishing the center's aging infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Florida's Space Coast seems to want more ambitious goals that can be packaged into excitement. Foreigners now make up 40 percent of the visitors at the space center, and Mr. Larson said they often knew more than Americans about the benefits of space exploration, from satellites to research on antibiotics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he prepared for another countdown, and another presentation about the future, Mr. Larson added, ''The thirst for knowledge just isn't there anymore.''</p>

Over the years, the transmissions have grown more and more robust, richer in information, giving us dazzling and detailed panoramas of Saturn's moons and rings and the surface of Mars. But there has never really been anything like the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Launched in mid-February, it is shipping a torrent of data our way from its orbit above the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Goddard Space Flight Center took the craft online, releasing the first videos and still images it shot. The quality of these images is extraordinary, 10 times the resolution of high-definition television, according to NASA.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have seen the surface of the Sun before, but never with this clarity. Every 10 seconds, the satellite photographs the solar disk in eight different wavelengths, and what emerges -- even in these earliest images -- is both stirring and disorienting. The Sun is the most constant object in our lives, but what we see in these videos is a livid, roiling star, mottled and seething on every wavelength. It is a thing of intense, disturbing beauty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Solar Dynamics Observatory follows on the work of other important solar projects, including the Solar and Heliographic Observatory and the twin satellites of the project known as Stereo, for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, which has its own iPhone app. For the next five years and more, this new satellite will be studying the patterns of solar energy that affect life on Earth, like the solar storm that lit up the aurora borealis in the past few weeks and can disrupt navigation and communications. And, in a sense, it creates a new solar effect, which is the ability of humans to peer directly into the most familiar of stars and realize how alien it is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials acknowledged that there would be a delay but said they had not yet decided when the final launching would be.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment, known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, was to be installed on the International Space Station as one last scientific errand before the final shuttle launching, of the Discovery, now scheduled for Sept. 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, however, Dr. Ting told NASA that he would replace a key component of the spectrometer, a powerful superconducting magnet, with an ordinary magnet. The redesigned instrument would not arrive at the Kennedy Space Center until August. It would be too late for July and is not a part of the final Discovery mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have an issue,'' Dr. Ting said in a telephone interview from CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland, where the instrument was built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they had not made any decisions on a new shuttle schedule this fall, including whether to switch the last two flights so that Endeavour's flight would be the finale. ''That launch is still where it is,'' said Kyle Herring, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about a possible delay at a news conference after the recent landing of Discovery, Mike Moses, director of shuttle integration at Kennedy, said that the agency was still looking at the potential impacts to the shuttle schedule, ''but we're still looking to finish this calendar year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of extending shuttle flights past September has already been covered by Congress, which allocated $600 million to cover potential shuttle operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, in case the schedule slipped. ''So it doesn't matter if it's one flight or two flights,'' Mr. Herring added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting said the collaboration had been pondering changing magnets for at least a year and had mentioned it to NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The superconducting magnet, which produces a field 17,000 times that at the Earth's surface and allows scientists to determine the charge and momentum of particles by how their tracks bend, needs to be cooled to near absolute zero by liquid helium. But tests and calculations showed that the helium would boil away too quickly, within two or three years, leaving the seven-ton spectrometer a dead hulk. Under the Obama administration's new plan, however, the space station will stay up to 2020 or even 2028.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it's correct to go there for three years where there is a chance to do physics for 18 years,'' Dr. Ting said. ''Because there is no way to remove it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting plans to replace the magnet with an ordinary one of the exact same size that flew in a test flight aboard the space shuttle in 1998, since it doesn't need helium cooling and thus will last as long as the station. The new magnet is only one-fifth as strong as the superconducting one, but Dr. Ting said the much longer running time of the experiment along with rearranging some of the layers of silicon that record tracks of particles would more than compensate for the weaker magnet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Sistilli, an astronomer who is NASA's program manager for the experiment, said that eliminating the need for handling supercold liquid helium would make things simpler and safer. When it warms up, liquid helium can boil explosively, as scientists at CERN found out a year and a half ago when part of the Large Hadron Collider, whose magnets are also cooled with liquid helium, exploded, delaying its operations for a year. The initial reaction at NASA, he said, was, ''Our life just got easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last-minute switch has caused head-scratching among some physicists, who despite Dr. Ting's protestations worry that the experiment has been degraded. Gregory Tarle, a physicist at the University of Michigan, said: ''It's highly unusual for an experiment to be redesigned this close to launch. I would question the wisdom of flying something redesigned so close to launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is only the latest adventure for an experiment that dates to the beginning of the space station era, in 1994, and has been controversial for about as long. It was originally meant to look for antimatter, but in recent years scientists have become more excited about the possibility that it could pick up signals from the mysterious dark matter that pervades the universe. Despite disagreement among scientists about the priority NASA gave to the experiment, a coalition of some 500 physicists from 16 countries, welded together by Dr. Ting's legendarily iron will, pressed ahead and put it together at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was tossed off the shuttle manifest in 2004 after the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and some prominent American physicists accused NASA of not sticking to its international commitments. Dr. Ting began making regular visits to Washington. In the fall of 2008 Congress subsequently ordered NASA to add one more shuttle flight for Dr. Ting's experiment.</p>

The Lower Hudson Valley Challenger Center will provide rocket kits for older children (the recommended minimum age is 10), to be assembled in a Saturday workshop; launching is scheduled for Sunday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huibregtse (pronounced HUGH-brex) emphasized that these launchings, powered by electrical ignition from a portable launch pad, were completely safe. The only danger? Losing the space vehicle.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running a day late because of cloudy weather, Capt. Alan G. Poindexter of the Navy took over manual control at an altitude of about 50,000 feet above the spaceport, guiding the shuttle through a sweeping right overhead turn to line up on Runway 33.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle's steep descent, Captain Poindexter pulled the Discovery's nose up just before the runway threshold, and the pilot, Col. James P. Dutton Jr. of the Air Force, deployed the landing gear, and the shuttle settled to a tire-smoking touchdown at 9:08 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston, Discovery, wheels stopped,'' Captain Poindexter radioed to mission control at the Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Roger, wheels stopped, Discovery. Welcome home,'' Frederick W. Sturckow, an astronaut and retired Marine colonel, replied from mission control. ''Dex, congratulations to you and the crew on an outstanding mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thanks for the words, it was a great mission,'' Captain Poindexter replied, adding, ''And we're glad the International Space Station is stocked up again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re-entry was delayed one orbit because of showers and concern about fog near the shuttle runway. But as dawn broke over the Florida spaceport, conditions improved and Bryan C. Lunney, the entry flight director, cleared the shuttle for a descent to the Kennedy Space Center, avoiding a diversion to Edwards Air Force Base in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To save fuel and avoid seasonal high-altitude ice clouds in the Northern Hemisphere, NASA prefers to bring the shuttles back to Florida on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory that carries them over the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean. But for the Discovery's flight, NASA managers approved a path from the northwest to southeast that gave the crew additional time in orbit to complete its 15-day space station resupply mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crossing the Canadian coast high above Vancouver, the Discovery plunged across the American Northwest, flying above Helena, Mont.; Casper, Wyo.; and northeast Colorado as it descended. The shuttle's computers guided the ship across central Kansas; Tulsa, Okla.; just north of Little Rock, Ark.; across central Mississippi; and Montgomery, Ala., before crossing into Florida to the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Poindexter; Colonel Dutton; Dorothy M. Metcalf-Lindenburger, the flight engineer; Naoko Yamazaki, a Japanese astronaut; Stephanie D. Wilson, operator of the robot arm; and Richard A. Mastracchio and Clayton C. Anderson, both spacewalkers, planned to fly back to Houston early Wednesday after reunions with friends and family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few miles from the runway, engineers were preparing the shuttle Atlantis for an overnight trip from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39A for liftoff May 14 on its final planned flight, a space station assembly mission. Rollout was delayed one day by the same weather that blocked the Discovery's return Monday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Discovery's landing, only three shuttle flights remain before the fleet is retired. The final two launchings, by the Endeavour and the Discovery, are planned for July 29 and Sept. 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the shuttle's retirement looming, NASA is racing the clock to deliver as much in the way of spare parts, supplies and science gear as possible to keep the space station operational during the gap between the end of shuttle operations and the debut of a new generation of American rockets. The Discovery's crew delivered more than 17,000 pounds of science gear and equipment.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to voyages of discovery, NASA's venerable Cassini mission is about as good as it gets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In six years of cruising around the planet Saturn and its neighborhood, the Cassini spacecraft has discovered two new Saturn rings, a bunch of new moons and a whole new class of moonlets. It encountered liquid lakes on the moon Titan, water ice and a particle plume on the moon Enceladus, ridges and ripples on the rings, and cyclones at Saturn's poles. Cassini also released a European space probe that landed on Titan. And Cassini has sent back enough data to produce more than 1,400 scientific papers -- at last count.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But besides the science, Cassini is state of the art in the arcane discipline of orbital mechanics -- how to get from one place to another in space to fulfill a mission's science requirements without running out of fuel. The plans are for Cassini to keep working for seven more years, but it currently has only 22 percent of the maneuvering propellant it had when it started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out how to more than double the duration of the mission with less than a quarter of the fuel is hard. Cassini's orbital mechanics present an astonishingly complex exercise in Keplerian physics and geometry. The enormous array of science objectives and targets -- moons, rings, Saturn itself -- makes it one of the most complex missions ever flown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Buffington, a Cassini mission designer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, compared the task to plotting a seven-year road trip around the United States for more than 200 scientists, all with different interests and all wanting to see different things. ''Now add the fact that you have a finite amount of time to design this road trip and need to adhere to the laws of physics, speed limits, the limited capabilities of the bus'' and the bus driver, he said. ''Oh, and the targets they want to see are moving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004 for a four-year mission, but it was so successful that NASA gave it a two-year extension, to September 2010. Then, in February, NASA extended it a second time for what it calls the Solstice mission, lasting until Saturn's northern hemisphere summer in 2017. If all goes as planned, on Sept. 15, 2017, Cassini will die a warrior's death, diving inside the rings for 22 spectacular orbits on the fringes of Saturn's atmosphere before plunging into the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini made it to its first, two-year extension in part because the science was simply too good to pass up. But another reason was that it performed so well and remained so healthy that it was left with enough unused propellant to enable it to maneuver through 64 additional orbits, after having already completed 75 in its first four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out how to organize the Solstice mission took two years. Scientists presented wish lists of places they wanted to visit and things they wanted to see. The tour designers showed them a plan and told them what was possible and what was not. Then both sides did it again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The competition was fierce, but collegial,'' said Jonathan I. Lunine, a Cassini scientist and a professor of planetary science and physics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were trade-offs. Nobody got everything, but everybody got a good many things. ''We try to satisfy as many people as possible,'' said Cassini's mission planning engineer, John C.Smith of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who, with Mr. Buffington, is responsible for designing the tour. ''We have to kill at least two and sometimes three birds with one stone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the fundamental tools for adjusting the trajectory of a large manufactured object in space -- the essence of orbital mechanics -- is the gravity assist. As a spacecraft approaches a planet or moon, gravity grips it and flings it in a different direction. In the 1970s and '80s, NASA used the gravity assist technique to enable the tiny Voyager 2 to complete its ''grand tour'' of the outer planets of the solar system. Voyager 2 employed four gravity assists. The Cassini Solstice mission alone will require 56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular analogy for the gravity assist is ''slingshot,'' but that term makes today's orbit designers grit their teeth. ''It's a lot more sophisticated than that,'' said David Seal, Cassini's mission planning supervisor. ''We can do a lot of things to get pretty much any trajectory we want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better analogy, he said, is two ice skaters in a hockey rink: a little girl and her father. The little girl is Cassini, small and fast; Dad is slow but strong. When the little girl reaches Dad at the red line, they clasp hands and Dad rotates. He can fling his daughter farther down the ice toward the far goal, toss her at right angles into the boards, send her back where she came from or let her go off at an angle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cassini's case, Dad, aptly perhaps, is Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Bigger than the planet Mercury, it is the only thing in the Saturn system, besides Saturn, with enough gravity to make radical changes in the spacecraft's trajectory every time it flies by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without Titan,'' Mr. Seal said, ''we would go into one orbit around Saturn and be stuck there.'' Thus Titan, in the argot of orbital mechanics, is Cassini's ''tour engine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic geometry of the Saturn system is not difficult to understand. Like Earth, the polar axes of both Saturn and Titan run from north to south and are canted slightly, which gives both the planet and its largest moon ''seasons.'' A Saturn year lasts almost 30 Earth years. Cassini arrived at Saturn in the southern summer and will finish 13 years later in the northern summer. Being able to observe the change of seasons for half a Saturn year was the dominant principle in designing the Solstice mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rings of Saturn and the vast majority of its moons, including Titan, are spread out on a roughly horizontal plane from the planet's equator. Cassini needs to fly two kinds of orbits of Saturn to get the science it wants. Equatorial orbits put the spacecraft on the same plane as the moons and the rings. Using this type of orbit -- always elliptical -- Cassini can get great views of Saturn and is able to cross the orbits of several of Saturn's icy moons for close observations and imagery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equatorial orbits, however, make it impossible to see the rings, which appear as a knife edge in the middle of the planet. For ring observations, inclined orbits are a must. The spacecraft has orbited Saturn at latitudes as high as 74.7 degrees, enabling the spacecraft to look down -- or up -- at the rings, and also to observe the poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout Cassini's lifetime the tour designers must keep a close watch on the amount of fuel that it has for navigation. This is measured as a change in spacecraft velocity in meters per second and is known in aerospace parlance as delta-V. For example, if scientists want a closer approach to the moon Enceladus, the designers might tell them the delta-V cost is 10 meters per second, and scientists and engineers will decide whether the science is worth the expenditure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Cassini began, the spacecraft had 742 meters per second delta-V available, and for the initial four-year prime mission'' and extended two-year Equinox mission, ''the cost of doing business was about 100 meters per second per year, maybe a little more,'' Mr. Seal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has left 158 meters per second delta-V for the next seven years. What makes the Solstice mission doable is that designers can trade time for fuel -- it may cost less delta-V to reach a target if the spacecraft takes longer to get there. They also use ingenuity to achieve mission objectives atlower fuel cost. And each flyby of Titan adds as much as 840 meters per second of delta-V, which is the energy used for major alterations in Cassini's trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For purposes of planning, the Cassini scientists were divided into five ''disciplines'': those concerned with Saturn; with Titan; with the rings; with the icy satellites; and with the magnetosphere. Leaders of the groups, beginning in early 2008, huddled with the designers every few months to examine orbits and argue their respective causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We decided the theme of the Solstice mission was 'seasonality,' '' said Dr. Lunine, co-chairman of the Titan and icy satellites disciplines. ''Not just the ringed planet itself, but also Titan.'' With a seasonal weather cycle, ''it was very important to see what happened to Titan when summer moved from the southern hemisphere summer to northern hemisphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a lot of competition among the disciplines, and not just over target selection: ''If you're interested in the magnetosphere, you collect data over long periods of time,'' while ''Titan is short bursts,'' Dr. Lunine said. ''And within the Titan group, you have radar versus spectroscopy.'' The icy satellites group wanted a visit to a small moon, he added, ''but it didn't connect with seasonality, and we lost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time Mr. Smith and Mr. Buffington met with the discipline teams, they offered three possible tours. The next time, they offered two, and, in January 2009, the scientists picked one of them. Last July, after six months of tweaking by Mr. Smith and Mr. Buffington, the final ''reference trajectory'' was delivered. It now includes 56 passes over Titan, 155 orbits of Saturn in different inclinations, 12 flybys of Enceladus, 5 flybys of other large moons -- and final destruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not like any problem set you get in college, because you have so many factors pulling in different directions,'' Mr. Seal said. ''The best way to measure it is to look at how much better the next iteration is than the previous one'' until ''you're only making slight improvements.'' Then you stop.</p>

But it drew immediate, fierce opposition from states that feared they would lose jobs and from Congressional boosters of the traditional space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It called for scrapping the Bush administration's program to return to the Moon by 2020, which had fallen hopelessly behind schedule and relied on outdated technology. It substituted a big investment in developing new technologies to make travel farther into the solar system cheaper and faster. In the meantime, NASA would rely on commercial companies to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station after the aging shuttle fleet is retired.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday, Mr. Obama sought -- personally -- to win over his critics, offering a powerful rationale for his plan and some reasonable modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To mitigate the impact of job losses as the shuttle program winds down, the president is now pledging to spend $40 million to promote job creation and economic development in Florida. He will also resuscitate a program to build a space capsule, but a scaled-down version to be parked at the space station for emergency escapes. That would preserve jobs in some battleground states and lay the foundation for upgrading the capsule later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has given no clue as to how much that will cost and which other NASA programs it will pillage to pay the bill. Congress must make certain that vital research programs are not harmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were concerned that the original proposal had not identified a clear goal for space travel or set deadlines for getting there. On Thursday, the president began to fill in the blanks. He called for picking a rocket design for deep space travel by 2015, allowing production to start earlier than previously planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ruled out returning to the surface of the Moon because ''we have been there before'' and called instead for crewed missions into deeper space, starting in 2025 with a visit to an asteroid. By the mid-2030s, he expects humans will orbit Mars. We don't know how realistic these projections are since the administration has yet to put forth a thorough analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also don't know if Mr. Obama will manage to win over opponents. But Thursday's speech suggests that he has learned an important lesson from the yearlong struggle to pass health care reform. He needs to get involved early and not leave it to subordinates to defend plans that will upend vested interests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Friday about a speech by President Obama on revamping the space program referred incorrectly in some copies to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, whose district includes parts of Houston close to Johnson Space Center. While Ms. Lee attended the president's speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, she did not travel there on Air Force One with him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Pointing to Mars and asteroids as destinations, President Obama on Thursday forcefully countered criticisms that he was trying to end the nation's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the first time that the president had lent his personal political capital in an increasingly testy fight over the future of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is, nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space than I am,'' he said in a speech to about 200 attendees of a White House-sponsored space conference here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was unwavering in insisting that NASA must change in sending people into space. ''We've got to do it in a smart way,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and we can't just keep on doing the same old things we've been doing and thinking that's going to get us where we want to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of earlier vague assurances by Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, and other administration officials that NASA would eventually venture beyond Earth orbit, Mr. Obama gave dates and destinations for astronauts. But the goals would be achieved long after he leaves office: a visit to an asteroid after 2025, reaching Mars by the mid-2030s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Step by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do,'' Mr. Obama said. ''In short, 50 years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama noted that President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to land on the Moon in 1961 -- the year the current president was born. But the plan Mr. Obama laid out for now through the 2030s was unlike the Kennedy vision: It was a call for private industry to innovate its way to Mars, rather than a call for a national effort to demonstrate American predominance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget request to Congress in February proposed a major shift for NASA: canceling the Constellation program, started five years ago to send astronauts back to the Moon, and turning to private companies for carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strikingly, Mr. Obama used the speech to blame his predecessors for lacking leadership on space policy and the critics of his own plan for failing to recognize that times have changed. NASA's budgets, he noted, have ''risen and fallen with the political winds.'' That appeared to be a shot at President George W. Bush, who announced a new plan for NASA after the Columbia disaster and barely mentioned space policy again for the rest of his presidency. And he argued that turning to private entrepreneurs would result in more space flights and more astronauts in orbit than the space plan he inherited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some members of Congress, particularly those in states that are home to NASA centers working on Constellation, have objected to the change, and the speech did not sway those who have been most vociferously opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no concrete plan, no deadlines to make it happen,'' said Representative Pete Olson, Republican of Texas, whose district includes the Johnson Space Center. ''It didn't change my opinion at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's speech contained few surprises as White House officials previewed it to reporters two days ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the small concessions to critics, Mr. Obama is now proposing to revive the Constellation's Orion crew capsule as a stripped-down version to use as a lifeboat for the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions,'' Mr. Obama said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama promised $40 million to help retrain workers in and around the Kennedy Space Center who will lose their jobs when the space shuttles are retired. He also stated that NASA would start developing a heavy-lift rocket by 2015, a promise that presumes the president's re-election in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tweaks appear to reflect political calculations. Florida and its 27 electoral votes are a likely key battleground in the next presidential election. On board Air Force One with the president on the flight to the Kennedy Space Center were two Democratic members of Congress from Florida: Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represents parts of Houston close to the Johnson Space Center, was one of the attendees. Mr. Olson, a Republican, did not receive an invitation to the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether appeals for loyalty from Democrats would succeed in gaining Congressional support is unclear. NASA has traditionally received strong support from both political parties, and the opposition to Mr. Obama's plans has also been bipartisan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kosmas, for example, is a co-sponsor of a bill to extend operations of the space shuttles, and Mr. Nelson has pushed for continued work on Constellation rockets as precursors to a heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm encouraged,'' Mr. Nelson said, although he said he would continue pushing to continue development of the Constellation rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reviving Orion could mollify <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> executives upset over the proposed cancellation. The Orion work is done largely at the Johnson Space Center and at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> facilities in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While using Orion as a space station lifeboat may be politically savvy, some space experts, particularly those associated with the Constellation program, said the economic and technical rationale for the decision eluded them. It would take about $8 billion to finish the development of the current incarnation of Orion; a simpler version would most likely still cost several billion dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the end, this seems like an expensive proposition that makes simply continuing to use the Russians for crew rescue look like a bargain,'' Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who oversaw the creation of Constellation, wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elon Musk, the chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, cheered the president's speech and policy. He said the Dragon capsule that his company is developing could also serve as a lifeboat, and its design would also allow six-month stays at the station.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an announcement to be made at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the president will personally talk for the first time about the sweeping upheaval of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's human spaceflight program outlined in his 2011 budget request: canceling the current program that is to send astronauts back to the Moon, investing in commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit and developing new space technologies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A senior administration official said Mr. Obama would describe a vision ''that unlocks our ambitions and expands our frontiers in space, ultimately meaning the challenge of sending humans to Mars.'' The official spoke with administration approval, but on the condition of anonymity so that the comments would not upstage the president's remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget request called for the cancellation of Orion crew capsule, which was to be used to carry astronauts to the International Space Station and then to the Moon, as well as other components of the current program known as Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president will propose that a simpler version of the Orion be used as a lifeboat for the space station. Russian Soyuz capsules currently provide that function. Because the Orion lifeboat would not carry astronauts to the space station, it could be launched on existing rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official said Mr. Obama would also announce that he would commit to deciding in 2015 on a design of a heavy-lift rocket for NASA. ''This means major work on the heavy-lift rocket at least two years earlier than Constellation,'' the official said. Astronauts would leave Earth orbit in the early 2020s, the official said, destined for the Moon, asteroids and eventually Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama will also announce $40 million devoted to helping Florida adjust economically after the retirement of the space shuttles, scheduled for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official also pointed to a study conducted by the Tauri Group, a consulting firm, and financed by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group, which estimated the president's plan would create 10,000 jobs nationally over the next five years. NASA estimates 2,500 would be in Florida along the Space Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's plan has been cheered by so-called New Space advocates who believe that traditional NASA programs are too big, too expensive and too slow and that turning to entrepreneurs will spur a vibrant new space industry. But even many of those who support the new strategy say the administration has not done a convincing job of explaining it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has not been a well-articulated plan and vision,'' said Edward F. Crawley, an engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who served on the blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others find the essentials of the plan flawed, not just the presentation. In a letter to Mr. Obama, reported Tuesday by NBC News, Mr. Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, along with James A. Lovell Jr., the commander of Apollo 13, and Eugene A. Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17, wrote, ''For the United States, the leading space-faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second- or even third-rate stature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter released Monday, 27 NASA veterans -- including Eugene F. Kranz, the flight director who presided over the safe return of the crew aboard the crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft in 1970 -- asked Mr. Obama to reconsider the ''misguided proposal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reception from Congress has so far been mostly chilly but mostly from representatives in states that are home to the NASA centers that would be most hurt by the changes -- the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Johnson Space Center in Texas and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some members of Congress from non-NASA states, like David Wu, Democrat of Oregon, have also criticized the plan, and only one, Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, has enthusiastically endorsed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's budget -- $18.7 billion this year -- consumes a 0.5 percent sliver of the federal budget. Under Mr. Obama's plans, NASA would receive slightly more next year -- $19 billion next year -- but, in canceling Constellation, much of the money would be moved away from human spaceflight to other programs like Earth science and aeronautics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials have noted that the budget request adds $6.1 billion to NASA's budget over next five years, which they say demonstrates the president's support to the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that follows a $3.4 billion cut that Mr. Obama made last year in the five-year projection for the Constellation part of NASA's budget.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- During his trip to the Kennedy Space Center this week, President Obama will be confronted with an awkward political reality: when it comes to space exploration, sometimes even Republicans can be passionate advocates for the public option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've joined with Democratic colleagues in Congress to oppose Mr. Obama's plan to reduce NASA's missions and to encourage private companies' rockets to haul cargo and astronauts into space. Mr. Obama's critics accuse him of abandoning NASA's glorious trailblazing tradition -- and maybe, if your constituents have jobs at NASA, it's possible to see something pioneering about an agency whose flagship goes a few hundred miles into space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four decades after the moon landing, why isn't NASA venturing somewhere more exotic? The glory days of the Apollo moon missions were possible only because of the race against the Soviet Union, and Mr. Obama could revive that spirit by starting a new space race. But not if he gives in to demands to keep NASA wobbling along in current fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main problem with NASA is not lack of money. Its current budget is about the same size, when adjusted for inflation, as the average during the 1960s and early 1970s. But space exploration has become so costly that this level of financing won't even pay for a return to the Moon anytime soon, which is what prompted the White House to cancel the Bush administration's lunar mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, once a pioneer makes the first trip somewhere, the cost goes down as others follow and technology improves. That's why so many colonists could follow Columbus to the New World, and why the masses today can afford to fly in Lindbergh's path back to Europe. The real costs of shipping freight by rail and air have declined by an order of magnitude since locomotives and airplanes were invented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space transportation, though, many costs have actually risen since the days of Apollo. NASA estimates that each seven-person space shuttle mission now costs about $65 million per astronaut, and outside experts say the true cost, once you add in all shuttle-related expenses, is double or triple that figure. Even a cramped trip to the space station on the Russian government's Soyuz will cost the United States more than $50 million per astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elon Musk has promised to do the job for just $20 million by building his own rocket, which is being readied for a test launch next month. His company, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, is saving money through innovations like assembling the rocket horizontally inside a prefab hangar here at Cape Canaveral, thereby avoiding the costs of the customized towers and scaffolding used by NASA to assemble its rockets vertically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important innovation for the space program, Mr. Musk said, would be to get away from the old ''cost plus'' model in which NASA contractors are guaranteed a profit on top of whatever costs they incur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cost-plus approach encourages aerospace companies to find the most expensive way to do something and drag it out as long as possible,'' said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk, the entrepreneur who co-founded <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>. ''Future contracts should be given to meet milestones based on objective design reviews and actual hardware completion. If a company meets the milestone, they get paid. If not, they don't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Obama's new plan, there would be further encouragement for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and other private companies. The traditional aerospace companies remain leery of the plans, as my colleague Ken Chang reported Monday, but there are other upstarts besides <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> working on projects to get humans into space, and they would be potential competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While private companies would ferry humans and cargo into orbit, NASA would be redirected into basic research and development of technologies for trips far beyond Earth, according to Mr. Obama's plan. This R&amp;D, as White House officials are quick to note in preparation for their Florida trip, would provide jobs in some of the Congressional districts affected by the closing of the shuttle and lunar programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, it could make sense for NASA to be doing the high-risk advanced research that could yield breakthroughs for a trip to Mars. But how much progress would NASA actually make?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to encourage innovation would be to convert some of NASA's divisions into versions of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which has successfully sent robotic probes across the solar system. The laboratory is financed by NASA but operated by CalTech, and therefore freer to innovate outside of political and Civil Service constraints. A presidential commission in 2004 recommendedthat NASA convert some of its research centers to this academic model, but the agency's bureaucracy showed little interest in surrendering control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to prod NASA would be to set specific goals. Robert Zubrin, the president of the Mars Society, argues that NASA has been effective only when given a definite destination and hard timetable -- the Apollo Mode, as he calls it, which is still used successfully on robotic missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the moon landings, he said, the human spaceflight program has been stuck in the Shuttle Mode, in which the agency develops technologies to please bureaucratic and political constituencies. Instead of looking for the best ship to reach a goal, it looked for a goal (like the space station) to justify the ship. To Dr. Zubrin, the new Obama plan looks like more of the Shuttle Mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The plan proposes to spend $100 billion on human spaceflight over the next 10 years in order to accomplish nothing,'' he said. ''If we are going to have a NASA human spaceflight program, it must be given a goal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zubrin would like to see NASA committed to a goal like building a ship to reach an asteroid by 2016 (a year that would just happen to fall within a second Obama term) as preparation for a journey to Mars. That's not a bad goal, although I can't see how the agency could afford to make the trip itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it could do is oversee a competition among companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> or whatever nonprofit groups wanted to participate. It could offer a series of prizes, like the cash bonus that Lindbergh collected for crossing the Atlantic. Or there could be contracts given to the competitors that would be based strictly on their performance, not on their costs. (To debate these ideas, go to nytimes.com/tierneylab.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if Mr. Obama, in Kennedyesque fashion, started a race to Mars in which NASA set milestones along the way and rewarded competitors only when they passed each one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It'd be cool to set a Mars goal,'' Mr. Musk said. ''Personally, I think it could be done in 10 years.'' Maybe he's being overoptimistic, but what's the harm in letting him -- and everyone else -- go for it?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, the aerospace giants with decades of experience working on America's space program, will happily sell rockets to carry astronauts into space, but the companies are leery about taking a leading role in President Obama's vision for a revamped National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of NASA relying on smaller companies -- unproven upstarts in the view of critics -- could create yet another hurdle in convincing an already skeptical Congress of the idea of relying on commercial companies to provide taxi transportation to the International Space Station.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think there is a business case for us,'' John Karas, vice president and general manager of human spaceflight at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, said about space taxis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has been enthusiastic. ''We have a vested interest in the International Space Station,'' Brewster H. Shaw, vice president and general manager of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s NASA Systems business unit, said in February after NASA awarded the company $18 million to draw up a preliminary design of a capsule that could serve as the basis of a commercial crew system. ''We want to see I.S.S. live up to its potential by having a robust logistics for the delivery of cargo and crew.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed by military contractors, said <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is more skeptical in private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> began pursuing the commercial space business through an international partnership called Sea Launch; it also developed the Delta IV rocket to launch both military and commercial satellites. The company lost money in both efforts, with Sea Launch filing for bankruptcy in 2009. To stem the Delta IV losses, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, which was also losing money with its Atlas V rocket, set up a joint venture called the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Senior <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> executives have told me that they are skeptical about new launch opportunities, given the losses they incurred on previous initiatives such as Sea Launch and the Pentagon's expendable launcher program,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''They are unlikely to invest large amounts of money on the new NASA vision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has called for the cancellation of NASA's current Constellation program to send astronauts back to the Moon. In its place, the administration would like to spend $6 billion over five years to finance the development of rockets and crew capsules by commercial companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have said the program would be set up to attract new and established companies. The money would most likely be split between two or more companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In pitching the idea, administration officials have said that commercial companies have always built the rockets and spacecraft that carried American astronauts and that it would not be a radical shift to turn to aerospace companies with decades of experience. They also contend that competition would spur innovation and drive down the launching costs, which, in turn, would open vibrant new markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not described details of the planned competition, and the companies said they would take a look at what the agency proposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Assuming the business case is right, we're all in,'' said Keith Reiley, program manager for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s capsule development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business case depends on how much money NASA will be asking the companies to invest. In traditional ''cost plus'' development, NASA pays for everything. In that case, Mr. Reilly said, ''of course, we'd be happy to do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If NASA were to ask the companies to shoulder all of the financial risk, however, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> would certainly not participate. The key would be how the $6 billion would be divided. ''Hopefully,'' Mr. Reilly said, ''those issues will get resolved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed were stung during the last burst of optimism for the commercial space business about a decade ago. They invested several billion dollars -- Lockheed to develop its Atlas V, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> for the Delta IV -- in the hopes that the huge market for commercial satellites would supplement their traditional business of launching American military spy satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market did not materialize, and what business there was went to European and Russian rockets that were cheaper. With the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> share costs and profits equally. The joint venture now operates in the black, but the companies did not recoup their original investments, and much of the infrastructure they built remains underused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think people who have been in the launcher business for many years find it hard to take the president's plan seriously,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''They think it sounds like an elaborate wake for the human spaceflight program more than a plan for moving forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hoped-for commercial market for space taxis hinges on one small company, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> of Las Vegas, which is teaming up with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> on its capsule design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded by Robert T. Bigelow, a real estate investor who made a fortune with the Budget Suites hotel chain, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> is developing inflatable space habitats that it hopes to market as research facilities to companies and foreign nations looking to establish a space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's plans are ambitious. It is already negotiating with <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> for seven Atlas V launches in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That nearly doubles the output of the Atlas V in any given year,'' said Michael N. Gold, director of Bigelow's Washington office. ''It's really a snowball effect here,'' he said, with economies of scale expected to drive down the costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result of the launches in 2014 would be a private space station that could house 12 astronauts -- twice as many as the International Space Station. Plans call for a second, even larger Bigelow station two years later, with room for 24 astronauts. The company projected 148 to 176 launches between 2014 and 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're extremely confident in the market,'' Mr. Gold said. The only missing pieces, he said, are the rockets to carry people to and from the Bigelow stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Bigelow's plans do not unfold as the company projects, and if NASA were the only customer, the space taxi business might be too small -- perhaps just two flights a year to the International Space Station -- and too risky for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> or <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> to invest much time and money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James McAleese, a defense consultant in McLean, Va., said that large aerospace firms like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed typically generate returns of 11 percent or 12 percent on their investments, and that for riskier enterprises like space, the companies would be looking for even higher returns. ''I don't believe there's a burning desire to get into the spacecraft piece of the business,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a commercial market developed, that could still be a lucrative business, said Mr. Karas, of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, who once led the company's expendable rockets business. But he added, ''Personally, this is exactly the same rhetoric as last time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed declined to bid directly on NASA's plans, at least some of the astronauts would probably be traveling in Atlas Vs or Delta IVs built by those companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA competition may seek proposals solely for spacecraft -- the crew capsules or winged craft atop the rockets -- rather than the rockets themselves. The spacecraft makers would specify which rocket a craft would launch on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One likely bidder, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., is developing both a crew capsule, the Dragon, and its own rocket, the Falcon 9. Other possible competitors, like Blue Origin, a start-up by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, would build only the capsule and put it on top of an existing rocket, with the most likely choice being <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>'s Atlas V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joint venture would sell rockets -- the lower-end versions of the Atlas V cost about $150 million each -- to the spacecraft makers. Thus, the alliance -- and, indirectly, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> -- would continue their involvement with NASA's space program, but in a secondary role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael C. Gass, president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, has said that upgrading the low-end version of the Atlas V for astronauts -- adding a monitoring system to alert controllers of problems with the rocket and modifying the launching pad to handle astronauts -- would cost $400 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you start getting into a heavier crew transfer vehicle and a dedicated launch facility, it's over a billion dollars, but less than two,'' Mr. Gass said. Those improvements ''should be funded by the U.S. government'' without additional investment from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Bigelow already negotiating launches, Mr. Gass said, he did not yet see a definite commercial market. ''The commercial market could develop,'' he said. ''Right now, we're approaching it as incremental.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's plan for space, announced this year, would terminate the Constellation program, which was to develop rockets to return humans to the moon. It would focus instead on developing commercial flights of crew and cargo to the International Space Station and long-range technology to allow sustained exploration, including by humans, beyond Earth's orbit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a one-hour telephone news conference, the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., and his deputy, Lori Garver, took turns rattling off names and price tags of new programs at each NASA center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them is an effort known as Flagship Technology Demonstrations, intended to test things like orbital fuel depots and using planetary atmospheres instead of braking rockets to land safely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That program would cost $6 billion over the next five years and would be run by the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The Kennedy Space Center in Florida is to get $5.8 billion over five years to develop a commercial program for carrying cargo and astronauts to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new programs, General Bolden said, were ''extending the frontiers of exploration beyond the wildest dreams of the early space pioneers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was then questioned by reporters who wanted to know why some members of Congress thought this was the end of human spaceflight and about the lack of a long-term goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With all due respect to everybody,'' the general replied, ''a serious and real concern for everyone is the jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As technology advances, there are fewer and ''fewer manual-type jobs,'' he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Constellation, several thousand jobs were going to be lost. ''I think that is a significant issue for people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said that since NASA's budget request was going up in the next five years, a result would be more jobs nationwide and agencywide rather than fewer. There might be a rebirth, he hoped, of people going into aeronautics or earth science.</p>

After yanking, and cursing, ''Finally he got the thing to budge,'' Dr. Massimino said. ''That's what I was thinking when I was yanking on the handle on the Hubble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been reliving that moment in talks and interviews for the last year. Now, the whole world can as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Atlantis, commanded by Scott D. Altman, shipped off from Cape Canaveral, in addition to seven astronauts and thousands of pounds of tools and replacement instruments, it carried a special 575-pound Imax camera that recorded the action, including Dr. Massimino's cosmic yank, in 3-D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 19, ''Hubble 3D,'' a 40-minute film about the Hubble repair, directed by Toni Myers and narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio, opened in Imax theaters and science centers around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides bone-rattling liftoffs and astronauts goofing around in the space shuttle, the film features trips through the Hubble images themselves. In Imax and 3-D, the astronauts' tethers brush your hair in some scenes and stars hit your face like raindrops in a summer storm in others. One scene shows a Hubble image I hadn't seen before, of a protoplanetary disk of dust looking like a ring of hair, or a nest, surrounding a newly born star in the Orion nebula -- Genesis there, maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the film's last image, a cosmic web of light formed by the galaxies on large scale, the universe seems to glow like a crystal emerging from the dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the scenes in the movie were converted to 3-D using digital tricks, Ms. Myers of Imax, the director, said, but about eight minutes were recorded by a single 5,400-foot roll of film in that camera in the shuttle's cargo bay, operated remotely by the pilot, Gregory C. Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recording left and right images on alternate frames of film running sideways through the camera at 48 frames per second, eight minutes was all the time they could capture. The Imax team spent many hours with crew members as they rehearsed the mission in a water tank to make sure they got the crucial moments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting film, Ms. Myers said, is the culmination of 25 years of flying Imax cameras on space shuttles and the training of more than 100 astronauts to run them. ''We trained them to be directors in space,'' she said. It is a tradition that will end with the retirement of the space shuttle next year, she said, because there is no room on the Soyuz capsules that will replace it to bring back the film packages, which are as big as a pizza box and three inches thick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film has made something of a media star out of Dr. Massimino, who is seen not only fixing the telescope but also conducting chatty low-key interviews with his crewmates in space. He has also been on the road promoting the film and most recently rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino was born in 1962 and grew up in Franklin Square on Long Island, two miles out of Queens. The son of an inspector for the New York City Fire Department, he is the kind of astronaut who would bring the home plate from Shea Stadium up in space with him. He was inspired to join the space program, he said, by the camaraderie between the astronauts in the 1983 movie ''The Right Stuff,'' based on the book by Tom Wolfe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Something about that closeness and how they stood up for each other caught my attention,'' he recalled. ''My real interest was not in flying but the camaraderie between a group of people and being up there and being able to see the Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking a way into the program, Dr. Massimino enrolled at M.I.T., eventually emerging in 1992 with a Ph.D. in robotics. He joined NASA in 1996 and lucked out by being assigned to the fourth Hubble repair mission in 2002, on which he performed two spacewalks. He packed along all kinds of fire department and Port Authority mementoes in honor of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May's mission, the last ever to the telescope, reunited Dr. Massimino with some of the 2002 crew, including Commander Altman, who had led the previous mission, and the veteran Hubble repairman John M. Grunsfeld. Among Dr. Massimino's duties was to become the first person to use Twitter from space, as @Astro--Mike, sending down posts to more than 1.2 million followers. It was NASA's idea, he said. ''They wanted a guinea pig.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing video interviews in flight was his idea, he said, inspired by a complaint by a crewmate that the one-on-one interviews done by NASA were too dry. None of the camaraderie and banter he enjoyed with his crew came through. ''We're funny and we fix things, but we were portrayed as stiffs. I wanted people to see us as people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was easy for me to do, just film stuff and send it down,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the Atlantis blasted off, on May 11, Hubble was in bad shape, limping along on one 17-year-old camera and a backup data router. Five spacewalks were planned and in the end, despite years of training and engineering, none of them was easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bad moment occurred out of camera range during Dr. Massimino's first spacewalk of the mission. While he was scouring the cargo bay for a spare gyroscope to replace one that wouldn't fit, he was carrying on his shoulder a cable harness needed to supply power for a repair of Hubble's main camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somehow the hook got undone,'' he recalled. ''I look up and up above me I saw this harness is going away.'' There was only one; without it the camera could not be repaired. He grabbed it just in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino's worst moment, however, came two days later when he could not unscrew the last bolt holding the handrail that was blocking the broken spectrograph. ''That was a nightmare for me,'' he said. ''I felt horrible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whether we were going to find life on other planets was now down to zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, when he yanked, the handrail came off cleanly. ''I went from the lowest I had ever been to the happiest I had ever been outside a spaceship,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the mission succeeded brilliantly. Within weeks of their letting the telescope back loose into space, one of the new cameras installed on Hubble recorded images of the most distant galaxies ever seen, from an era only 500 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the shuttle program set to wind down this year or next, Dr. Massimino said there was little chance of him getting to space again anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the Earth from space, he said, was his favorite activity, and watching the movie brings it back. ''Those were the most memorable moments of my life. You don't want to forget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the stubborn handrail? Dr. Massimino said it was now in an office at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., where the engineers in charge of Hubble work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They let me keep it for a day, but I had to give it back,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrying a crew of seven and 10 tons of supplies and equipment, the Discovery lifted off from Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 6:21 a.m. after a problem-free countdown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riding atop a rushing plume of fire from the ship's twin solid-fuel boosters, the fuel-laden 4.5-million-pound spacecraft accelerated through 100 m.p.h. -- straight up -- in just seven seconds, majestically wheeling about to line up on a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching was timed for the moment when Earth's rotation moved the pad into the orbital plane of the space station. The laboratory complex streaked above the Florida spaceport 15 minutes before the shuttle's liftoff, a brilliant target hurtling through space at five miles per second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's climb to orbit appeared uneventful, with no obvious signs of problems. A camera mounted on the side of the ship's external tank showed a few pieces of presumably foam insulation falling away halfway through the ascent, but it was well after the period when debris poses a serious threat to the shuttle's heat shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts did run into a problem later with the shuttle's Ku-band antenna, used to send data and video to the ground via NASA satellites. Without the antenna, the analysis of a heat shield inspection scheduled for Tuesday will be delayed, and the commander, Capt. Alan G. Poindexter of the Navy, and the pilot, Col. James P. Dutton of the Air Force, will not be able to use the antenna in radar mode during docking with the space station around 3:44 a.m. on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the mission timeline will most likely have to be adjusted, NASA officials said the antenna problem would not affect the goals set for the Discovery's visit. Waiting to welcome the seven shuttle fliers will be the station's Expedition 23 crew of five men and one woman, including two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut who arrived at the lab early Sunday aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're absolutely delighted to have our friends and comrades joining us here in a couple of days,'' Col. Timothy J. Creamer of the Army said by radio from the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Stand by for a knock on the door,'' a flight controller replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Discovery's mission under way, only three shuttle flights remain as the space agency races to complete the international laboratory before retiring the orbiters this year. The station is essentially complete, but NASA is trying to stock the lab with spare parts and equipment as a hedge against potential problems after the station becomes dependent on smaller, less capable Russian, Japanese and European cargo craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three spacewalks are planned by Richard A. Mastracchio, a shuttle veteran, and Clayton C. Anderson, who spent six months on the station in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven Discovery crew members -- Captain Poindexter; Colonel Dutton; the flight engineer, Dottie M. Metcalf-Lindenburger; Stephanie D. Wilson; Mr. Anderson; Mr. Mastracchio; and a Japanese astronaut, Naoko Yamazaki -- are scheduled to undock from the space station on April 16 and land back at the Kennedy Space Center two days later.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the Large Hadron Collider referred incorrectly to the cooling effect of the Big Bang. It was the universe -- not the Earth -- that the Big Bang caused to coolfrom billions or trillions of degrees to superfrigid temperatures today.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Apr 11 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those whose physics knowledge was a bit rusty, the news about the Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest physics machine, might have been puzzling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the collider finally crashed subatomic particles into one another last week, but why, exactly, is that important? Here is a primer on the collider - with just enough information, hopefully, to impress guests at your next cocktail party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be basic. What does a particle physicist do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particle physicists have one trick that they do over and over again, which is to smash things together and watch what comes tumbling out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it mean to say that the collider will allow physicists to go back to the Big Bang? Is the collider a time machine?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists suspect that the laws of physics evolved as the universe cooled from billions or trillions of degrees in the first moments of the Big Bang to superfrigid temperatures today (3 degrees Kelvin) -- the way water changes from steam to liquid to ice as temperatures decline. As the universe cooled, physicists suspect, everything became more complicated. Particles and forces once indistinguishable developed their own identities, the way Spanish, French and Italian diverged from the original Latin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By crashing together subatomic particles -- protons -- physicists create little fireballs that revisit the conditions of these earlier times and see what might have gone on back then, sort of like the scientists in Jurassic Park reincarnating dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collider, which is outside Geneva, is 17 miles around. Why is it so big?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein taught us that energy and mass are equivalent. So, the more energy packed into a fireball, the more massive it becomes. The collider has to be big and powerful enough to pack tremendous amounts of energy into a proton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the faster the particles travel, the harder it is to bend their paths in a circle, so that they come back around and bang into each other. The collider is designed so that protons travel down the centers of powerful electromagnets that are the size of redwood trunks, which bend the particles' paths into circles, creating a collision. Although the electromagnets are among the strongest ever built, they still can't achieve a turning radius for the protons of less than 2.7 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All in all, the bigger the accelerator, the bigger the crash, and the better chance of seeing what is on nature's menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are physicists hoping to see?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to some theories, a whole list of items that haven't been seen yet -- with names like gluinos, photinos, squarks and winos -- because we haven't had enough energy to create a big enough collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any one of these particles, if they exist, could constitute the clouds of dark matter, which, astronomers tell us, produce the gravity that holds galaxies and other cosmic structures together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another missing link of physics is a particle known as the Higgs boson, after Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh, which imbues other particles with mass by creating a cosmic molasses that sticks to them and bulks them up as they travel along, not unlike the way an entourage forms around a rock star when they walk into a club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have scientists ever seen dark matter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's invisible, but astronomers have deduced from their measurements of galactic motions that the visible elements of the cosmos, like galaxies, are embedded in huge clouds of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will physicists see these gluinos, photinos, squarks and winos?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no guarantee that any will be discovered, which is what makes science fun, as well as nerve-racking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how much energy do you need to create these fireballs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Large Hadron Collider, that energy is now 3.5 trillion electron volts per proton -- about as much energy as a flea requires to do a pushup. That may not sound like much, but for a tiny proton, it is a lot of energy. It is the equivalent of a 200-pound man bulking up by 700,000 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's an electron volt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An electron volt is the amount of energy an electron would gain passing from the negative to the positive side of a one-volt battery. It is the basic unit of energy and of mass preferred by physicists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When protons collide, is there a big bang?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no sound. It's not like a bomb exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In previous trials, there was an actual explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that current is dangerous. During the testing of the collider in September 2008, the electrical connection between a pair of the giant magnets vaporized. There are thousands of such connections in the collider, many of which are now believed to be defective. As a result the collider can only run at half-power for the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the collider make a black hole and destroy the Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collider is not going to do anything that high-energy cosmic rays have not done repeatedly on Earth and elsewhere in the universe. There is no evidence that such collisions have created black holes or that, if they have, the black holes have caused any damage. According to even the most speculative string theory variations on black holes, the Large Hadron Collider is not strong enough to produce a black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too bad, because many physicists would dearly like to see one.</p>
