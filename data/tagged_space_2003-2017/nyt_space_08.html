<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts will abandon the International Space Station, probably in mid-November, if rocket engine problems that doomed a Russian cargo ship last week are not diagnosed and fixed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if unoccupied, the space station can be operated by controllers on the ground indefinitely and would not be in immediate danger of falling out of orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Russian astronauts, two Americans and a Japanese are living on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to do what's the safest for the crew and for the space station, which is a very big investment of our governments,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, manager of the space station program for NASA, during a news conference on Monday. ''Our job is, as stewards of the government, to protect that investment, and that's exactly what we're going to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $100 billion station has been continuously occupied for over a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, an unmanned Russian cargo ship known as the Progress, which was carrying three tons of supplies to the space station, crashed in Siberia. Telemetry from the rocket indicated that a drop of fuel pressure led its computer to shut down the third-stage engine prematurely five and a half minutes into flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz rocket that lifts the Progress is similar to the Soyuz rocket that takes astronauts to the station, and officials want to make sure they understand what failed on last week's launching and are confident it will not occur again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two unmanned launchings of Soyuz rockets are likely to occur before the next set of three crew members head to the space station. That launching had been scheduled for Sept. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of the Progress is of little immediate impact. One of the Russian astronauts is running short of clothes and might have to borrow some from NASA, Mr. Suffredini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current crew has plenty of supplies and could remain in space longer. What expires, however, is their return trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Soyuz capsules, each with seats for three passengers, are currently docked to the space station. But the capsules are certified to last only 200 days in orbit, because hydrogen peroxide for the spacecraft's thrusters degrades over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return of the first capsule has been pushed back a week, to Sept. 15, giving NASA and the Russian space agency more time to study their options. Delaying much more than that would run into a safety rule, that the capsules land during the day. The next opportunity would be in late October, beyond the 200-day limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians could study whether the capsule's condition could allow a longer stay, but Mr. Suffredini questioned whether that would be wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you've already been handed one significant challenge, maybe you shouldn't put another one on top of it until you sort that one out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other three crew members would return in the second Soyuz capsule in mid-November. If the problem with the Soyuz rocket had not been resolved, the station would then be empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experiments like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a particle physics experiment installed in May, would continue operating without human oversight. But other research would get short shrift until the full crew of six returned to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all of the day-to-day operations can be handled remotely, mission controllers may not be able to handle emergencies that might endanger the space station. ''There is a greater risk of losing the I.S.S. when it's unmanned than if it were manned,'' Mr. Suffredini said. ''The risk increase is not insignificant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the retirement of NASA's shuttles, the Soyuz rockets will be the only way for people to go to the space station for several years at least. The Soyuz, dating to the 1960s, has been a reliable workhorse for the Russian space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 31, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the prospect of astronauts' having to abandon the International Space Station misstated the timing of the installation of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer particle physics experiment at the station. It was installed in May, not last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the end of NASA's space shuttle program last month, American astronauts must travel into space on Russian Soyuz rockets. When one of them crashed over Siberia on Wednesday, concerns began to mount.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space officials canceled the Friday launching of a Soyuz rocket that was to carry a navigation satellite for Glonass, the Russian equivalent of the American GPS system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin also ordered an overhaul of the safety procedures at the Russian space agency, according to his spokesman. The changes will affect how the agency checks rockets, satellites and space vehicles it buys from Russian manufacturers and will influence its prelaunching procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the accident on Wednesday, the rocket's third and final stage shut down for reasons not yet known before the spacecraft had entered orbit. It arced back to earth with its cargo of fuel and food, including green apples and garlic cloves eagerly awaited by the space station's crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the region of Siberia where the rocket crashed, a village doctor reported Thursday that eight people complained of high blood pressure, throat irritation and fever. He suggested that they had been exposed to toxic fuel because the symptoms occurred only after the crash, according to Interfax.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian cargo rocket ferrying three tons of food and fuel to the International Space Station broke down about five minutes after it blasted off on Wednesday, completing its flight by arcing into a Siberian forest rather than achieving orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash of the unmanned craft, a Progress cargo ship on top of a Soyuz rocket, does not pose an immediate problem for the six crew members living at the space station, who are well stocked with supplies taken there in July by NASA's last shuttle flight. But it raises questions about the reliability of this model of Russian rocket, a similar model of which is used for manned launchings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the retirement of the shuttle program last month, Russian-made Soyuz rockets are the only means of transport to space for American astronauts. NASA has contracted with the Russian Space Agency to fly Americans on these rockets for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash on Wednesday will surely be closely scrutinized because of its implications for American manned space flight on the Russian rockets. If a quick diagnosis and fix elude Russian engineers, NASA and the other agencies collaborating on the space station could face difficult choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've always known this was a risk,'' the manager of the space station for NASA, Michael T. Suffredini, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next set of three crew members is scheduled to launch to the space station in September, and another three are to go up in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, the Soyuz capsules in which the crew members ride also serve as lifeboats in case of an emergency, and the capsules are allowed to stay at the station for up to 210 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It means that three crew members may have to return to Earth in one of the Soyuz capsules docked at the station by October at the latest. Without replacements, that would leave only three people to operate the station, greatly reducing the time they could devote to running experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the problem dragged on to the end of the year, the other three would also have to return to Earth, leaving the space station unoccupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini said the station could be operated from the ground and stay in orbit indefinitely as long as there were no major failures and other cargo ships continued to fly; a Japanese one and a European one are scheduled to be launched next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Progress and Soyuz have proven reliable until now. Forty-three of the supply ships have successfully flown to the space station. But the failure on Wednesday was the second in August from the Baikonur launching pad in Kazakhstan. The upper stage of a Proton rocket sent a telecommunications satellite into the wrong orbit on Aug. 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia is planning another Soyuz expedition on Thursday, from the Plesetsk launching pad in the far north of European Russia. That rocket is scheduled to carry a navigation satellite for the Glonass system, the Russian version of the American GPS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Russian space agency said it might delay manned launchings on the Soyuz -- the only means of reaching the station for astronauts and cosmonauts -- if the reasons for Wednesday's crash were not quickly determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Progress is a cargo spaceship that the Russians call a space truck, routinely launched to the space station carrying spare parts, fuel, food, oxygen, water and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz design is a 1960s holdover that jettisons four bulky booster rockets soon after liftoff, then flies in three stages to space. It carries both manned and unmanned spaceships to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the launching on Wednesday, the Progress lifted off as planned on top of a Soyuz rocket. A little more than five minutes later, however, the rocket's third-stage engine shut down sooner than it should have, before the spacecraft had enough velocity to reach orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket and Progress ship crashed in the dense Siberian forest. The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said rocket debris landed in three separate areas of the Altai region in southern Siberia, which borders Mongolia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional governor, Yuri Antaradonov, said the police had cautioned people to stay clear of the wreckage, as it could be contaminated with toxic fuel. His only concern, he said, was that some people may have been camped in the forest at the time of the crash because ''it is the season of collecting pine nuts'' in that part of Siberia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government agency that helped invent the Internet now wants to do the same for travel to the stars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what is perhaps the ultimate startup opportunity, Darpa, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, plans to award some lucky, ambitious and star-struck organization roughly $500,000 in seed money to begin studying what it would take -- organizationally, technically, sociologically and ethically -- to send humans to another star, a challenge of such magnitude that the study alone could take a hundred years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The awarding of that grant, on Nov. 11 -- 11/11/11 -- is planned as the culmination of a yearlong Darpa-NASA effort called the 100-Year Starship Study, which started quietly last winter and will include a three-day public symposium in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 30 on the whys and wherefores of interstellar travel. The agenda ranges far beyond rocket technology to include such topics as legal, social and economic considerations of interstellar migration, philosophical and religious concerns, where to go and -- perhaps most important -- how to inspire the public to support this very expensive vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Darpa plan has generated buzz as well as befuddlement in the labs, pubs, diners and Web sites that ring NASA centers both physically and virtually, where the dream of space travel has never died and where a few stubborn bands of scientists and engineers, fueled by science fiction dreams and prophecies, are designing spacecraft that could cross interstellar space, incubating a technology and preserving it for the day when it will be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to have a hobby, why can't it be designing an interstellar spacecraft?'' said Andreas Tziolas, who teaches at the University of Alaska and directs Project Icarus, a worldwide volunteer effort to design a spacecraft that could carry a scientific probe to a nearby star -- perhaps Alpha Centauri, 4.4 light-years from here -- in a trip that would take less than 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is what we do,'' said Louis Friedman, former executive director of the Planetary Society, in Pasadena, Calif., which bills itself as the world's largest public space organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists wonder if life, especially intelligent life, exists beyond Earth. Some day, the interstellar dreamers vow, the life out there will be us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People like Dr. Tziolas say the technology already exists or will soon exist to send instruments and perhaps even people to nearby stars, although a human flight could cost hundred of trillions of dollars. The half-million dollars Darpa will award is not enough to build a starship or even to buy a modest office in which to imagine one -- but it is enough to start serious fund-raising and, perhaps to invite ridicule from critics of government spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An actual human launching is at least a couple of centuries away and, barring the invention of Star Trek-like warp drives, could take additional centuries to complete. Whoever goes on such a journey will not be coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are plenty of reasons that humans will eventually summon the political will to make the trip, scientists say, if not for human restlessness that has taken us out of the caves and across the oceans, then to escape being wiped out when the killer asteroid appears or the Sun boils the oceans, which it will do in a couple of billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another lure could be the discovery of a habitable planet elsewhere, something that could happen in the next few years through the efforts of NASA's Kepler satellite and related astronomical efforts, according to Jill Tarter, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who has devoted her life to the search for extraterrestrials. ''This will get real when we have an Earth analogue as a destination,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Neyland, Darpa's director of tactical technology, is at pains to point out that the goal of his project is not an interstellar spacecraft, only a business plan for designing one. The search, he explained, is for an organization, presumably private, that can develop the interstellar vision without government help, carrying the load for the next 100 years, developing valuable technological offshoots the way investing in computer protocols enabled the Internet. (The time frame was inspired by Jules Verne, whose novel ''From the Earth to the Moon'' was published in 1865, 104 years before it came true.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After this November, whoever it is will be on their own. ''We don't intend to carry it forward,'' Mr. Neyland added. ''Darpa hands the keys over to this entity, and we wish them well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interstellar travel is a tall order. It would take Voyager 1, humanity's fastest artifact, now traveling 38,000 miles an hour relative to the Sun, more than 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri, if it were headed in that direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a group of physicists led by Theodore Taylor of <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> and Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study proposed propelling a ship by the pressure waves from atomic bombs dropped one after another out of the back, every three seconds. Such a spacecraft, they calculated, could reach Jupiter in a year but would take hundreds of years to reach Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Interplanetary Society used a more benign form for this propulsion idea in its interstellar spaceship study, Project Daedalus, in the 1970s. Their spacecraft would be powered by tiny thermonuclear explosions caused by compressing pellets of deuterium and helium-3 with laser blasts. It would carry a 500-ton scientific probe to Barnard's Star, 5.9 light-years away, in about 50 years, reaching a top speed of 12 percent of the speed of light along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tziolas said, ''That was the very first study that proved it's possible with knowledge we have now to travel to another star.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, other virtual collaborations have joined the party. The Tau Zero Foundation, based in Cleveland, was founded by Marc G. Millis, who directed propulsion research at the NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, to encourage work on ''practical interstellar flight.'' Last year Mr. Millis calculated that it would be at least 200 years before society had the energy resources to send 500 people out of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A variety of propulsion schemes have their fans and might prevail the long span between now and launch day -- a problem that Mr. Millis terms ''incessant obsolescence.'' Among them are gigantic sails pushed by sunlight or by powerful microwave beams and ion drives in which beams of high energy particles do the propelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientific probes could go sooner and cheaper. Professor Dyson recently pointed out that soon all the genetic information needed to reconstruct Earth's biosphere could be packed into something the size of an egg. Dispersed through space to different planets, such eggs could create homes-away-from-home waiting for us. ''The new technology will be biological,'' he said. ''It will make everything else obsolete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Mr. Neyland and Pete Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, quietly invited about 30 scientists, entrepreneurs and science fiction writers to a two-day brainstorming session in northern California. Mr. Neyland described the first meeting as an attempt to get past ''the giggle factor'' associated with the subject. Participants included scientists like J. Craig Venter of the J. Craig Venter Institute, who was one of the first to sequence the human genome, and writers like Joe Haldeman, author of the award-winning novel, ''The Forever War.'' One participant said, ''There were a few people on the other side of reality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, nobody is smart enough now to know what could come of the starship effort, Mr. Neyland pointed out. It would be naive to think we even know the right questions to ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you had asked Einstein and Marconi in 1910 to define a worldwide communication system for the common man,'' Mr. Neyland asked, ''would he have come up with the iPhone?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A call for ideas for the Orlando meeting drew hundreds of responses, which are being sorted to decide who will get to speak. Dr. Tarter, the astronomer at SETI, will coordinate talks on where to go. She has received 50 or 60 proposals, which she called a ''mixed bag,'' some of which read like U.F.O. reports. ''Maybe,'' she said, ''you have to be a little bit crazy to think about this seriously.'' She added, ''We've all read enough science fiction to be fundamentally optimistic about the possible outcome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin Long, a physics graduate student at Warwick University and member of Project Icarus, said he had already thought about the floor plans, an organization chart and even a Japanese garden in the backyard for a pyramidal Interstellar Institute, where the research for an interstellar trip could eventually be centered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of us are quite young. We grew up hearing about the Apollo program,'' he said. ''We want to be part of a significant journey. We personally think we may be doing something important, driving humanity out to the stars.'' He quoted Arthur C. Clarke, the late writer of science fact and fiction who invented the idea of communications satellites and helped found the British Interplanetary Society: ''If you believe something is possible, you can make it happen.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Already, a gender divide seems to be developing over the desirability of being launched into space, at least in the Bordian family, who were visiting the Space Needle here the other day, staring out at the cloudy cityscape and mulling the tower's latest promotional contest -- for a suborbital spaceflight, 62 miles above the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The husband, Kelly Bordian, 43, a dentist, thinks ''there is no cooler place to go.'' The wife, Lisa Bordian, 44, prefers to stay closer to home. ''I've just started traveling the earth,'' she said. ''I don't know if I'm ready for space.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern was repeated among several other men and women who were interviewed atop Seattle's most distinctive landmark, its sleek figure capped by what looks like a spaceship that just landed from Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Ron Sevart, the president of the Space Needle, who dreamed up the promotion, acknowledged a gender divide. He would love to go into space himself, he said, ''but my mother-in-law wouldn't let me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Space Needle turns 50 next year and is hoping to capitalize on, if not refurbish, its image as a symbol of the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower was built for the 1962 World's Fair, at the dawn of the space age. The ''Space Race'' sweepstakes, coming just as NASA's space shuttle program has ended, hopes to highlight the work of private companies that are picking up where NASA left off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Space Needle is partnering with Space Adventures, a private space tourism company that has arranged flights to the International Space Station for eight people who have paid for the multimillion-dollar adventure themselves; in this case, the Space Needle will cover all expenses, which officials put at $110,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sevart and others announced the contest on Aug. 1. In the first 48 hours, about 14,000 people submitted their names, through spaceneedle.com or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, officials said, and thousands more have been entering every day since. The contest closes Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sending someone into space seems a rather audacious public relations stunt, one that could carry considerable risk to the winner, not to mention the Space Needle. Mr. Sevart said the winner would sign a liability waiver. He has experience in such things, having run three major Six Flags properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Space Needle was looking for a particular type of person to carry its banner into the great beyond -- one who could articulate how going into space would enhance the narrative arc of his or her life, and, of course, reflect well on the Space Needle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just about somebody who's willing to take a risk,'' Mr. Sevart said the other day as he strolled through the crowds of tourists at the top of the Space Needle. ''It's about having a discovery persona. You want it to go to a person who says this is a big deal to them; you want this to be something that is on the path of who they are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the contest is closed, a computer will randomly select 1,000 people, who are to submit a short video about why they should be picked. A panel of judges, who have not yet been determined, will cull them for their fitness and the power of their personal stories and narrow them down to 40 finalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public will then have a chance to weigh in, ''American Idol''- style, by voting for their favorite 20. The judges then choose the winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear when the winner would lift off, but probably within a couple of years and probably from Texas, said Mary Bacarella, a spokeswoman for the Space Needle. The whole trip will take about half an hour. After the rocket reaches an altitude of 62 miles above earth, the engine shuts off and those onboard will experience zero gravity for about six minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Wright, chairman of the board of the Space Needle Corporation, whose family owns the icon, said he had challenged company officials to come up with something special to ''one-up'' its 45th anniversary, when they gave away a trip to the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thrilled with the results, Mr. Wright said he saw the trip to space as a chance to promote both Seattle and the Space Needle, which he calls ''a family heirloom.'' (His father was the original builder of the Space Needle and eventually acquired full ownership of it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If visitors to the Space Needle itself were any guide, men sounded more intrigued at the possibility of blasting off than women. Children of both genders were wild about the idea, though the age of eligibility is 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The final frontier, where no man has been before?'' Bill Skelton, 69, visiting from California, said after being asked if he wanted to go. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, he said, though he had some concern that the trip would be run privately, not by NASA. Still, he said, ''if someone gave me the chance to get in a rocket, why not?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His friend Linda West, 59, a banquet waitress also from California, had plenty of reasons why not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't even want to come up here -- I'm scared of heights,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have no interest,'' said Kimberly Brown, 23, a chef in Arkansas. ''Too many things could go wrong. I mean, space is fascinating, but someone like me isn't qualified to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her niece, Makenzie Marronie, 4, was champing at the bit. ''Yes!'' the little redhead shrieked. ''You can see the stars,'' she said. Just one thought troubled her. ''I don't know the way to outer space,'' she said, frowning, before concluding, ''I guess it's straight up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also contemplating the possibilities were Alan Moss, 60, an ophthalmologist, and Jane Moss, 63, his wife and office administrator, visiting from Worcester, Mass. They said that being in space might provide a useful perspective. For example, they said, by seeing how big the earth is, they might see that humans have ruined only a small part of it, not as much as they have feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could look down on the planet,'' Mr. Moss said. ''It would be an extraordinary experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And,'' said Mrs. Moss, ''you could see how insignificant we really are.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time we saw Jupiter up close, it was 16 years ago, when a probe from NASA's Galileo spacecraft took a death plunge through the cloud tops and radioed back tantalizing data that all but screamed, ''To be continued...''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now NASA is headed back to the big planet, looking for the clues to help answer pressing questions about the early days of the solar system. Because whatever was in Jupiter at the beginning -- more than 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system was formed -- is still there, scientists say, hiding in a mysterious gas giant made up of dust and gas left over by the Sun.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft named Juno (after Jupiter's wife in Roman mythology) is scheduled to lift off Friday morning from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, embarking on a five-year trip. On July 4, 2016, as determined by planetary mechanics, not American patriotism, Juno will pull into orbit around Jupiter and spend a year there, making scientific observations of gravity, magnetic fields and the wetness of the Jovian atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then scientists may learn more of the secrets of Jupiter, which has twice as much mass as the rest of the planets in the solar system combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Jupiter holds the history of the solar system,'' said Scott Bolton, director of the space science department at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in San Antonio, and the principal investigator for the Juno mission. ''If you want to understand that first step of how you went from forming a sun to forming the planets, you have to understand what went into Jupiter and how it was made.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the wait will be long, scientists are excited enough about what they learned from Galileo -- which was sent into Jupiter's atmosphere in 2003, lest it crash into one of the moons and contaminate the environment with bacteria from Earth -- that they have great expectations for Juno. The trip is costing $1.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest question is the water, because Galileo's atmospheric probe found hardly any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a missing piece that turns out to be important,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have the big picture of the origins of the solar system. A cloud of hydrogen, much like interstellar hydrogen clouds seen elsewhere in the galaxy, collapsed to form the Sun. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin, like a figure skater pulling in the arms. That produced a flattened disk of leftovers orbiting the newborn Sun, and those leftovers coalesced into the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What exactly was in those leftovers is not known, however, which is why many of the spacecraft crisscrossing the solar system are looking for pristine remnants in comets, asteroids and -- soon -- Jupiter. While scientists can explain the hydrogen and the helium, it is the smidgen of heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, iron and nitrogen that are key elements for almost everything on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Life is in the balance here,'' Dr. Bolton said, ''and the things that make us up -- that everything we're looking at, breathing, touching -- is all more or less unexplained.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few reasons that Jupiter holds particular interest for scientists. For one thing, it probably formed first, before the other planets. And its gravity is so strong that once anything got sucked into it during those formative years, it never got out again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the Galileo mission, astronomers had measurements indicating that Jupiter contained higher concentrations of heavier elements than the Sun -- a surprising finding, because both bodies were formed out of the same hydrogen cloud. But they came up with a plausible explanation: Among the solar system leftovers, they speculated, were water ice crystals. After all, hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, oxygen is third and water molecules -- two hydrogens and one oxygen -- should be common. Ice traps heavier elements, and thus the icy bits that gathered into what became Jupiter could have skewed the concentrations higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Galileo probe did measure enhanced concentrations, as expected, but not in the pattern predicted by the ice explanation. ''In fact, in that one measurement, all the theories of how planets were made were proven wrong,'' Dr. Bolton said, ''and we were like, 'Oh no, what now?' Nature threw us a curveball.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more perplexing was the paucity of water. In the post-mortem analysis, many scientists surmised that, by unlucky chance, the probe descended into a particularly hot and dry spot on Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was only an educated guess. The obvious next step would have been to send more probes beneath the cloud cover of Jupiter -- especially ones that could survive to greater depths and temperatures -- but that would have been prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno is taking a different approach. The heat of Jupiter emits microwaves, and water absorbs microwaves. By simply measuring the strength of the microwaves radiating from Jupiter, scientists will be able to figure out how much water is in the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once we get all those ingredients, we'll see if we can figure out how to bake the cake, so to speak,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make the measurements, Juno will travel along a squashed elliptical orbit, swooping to within 3,100 miles of the cloud tops. Over the course of 33 orbits during the mission, Juno will get a global view of the interior. Unlike Galileo's orbit, Juno's will pass over Jupiter's north and south poles, allowing the first close-up looks at the bright auroras there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To survive the intense radiation around Jupiter, its instruments are housed inside a titanium vault. Eventually, the radiation will destroy the electronics and the craft will be sent crashing into the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravity and magnetic field measurements could provide evidence of metallic hydrogen -- at the crushing pressures inside Jupiter, hydrogen is expected turn into a liquid metal -- and a core of heavier elements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Bolton revealed that Juno would be carrying a commemorative plaque of Galileo Galilei, the scientist who first looked at Jupiter through a telescope, as well as three aluminum Lego figures: of Galileo, Juno and Jupiter carrying his thunderbolts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing about parallel universes -- which may be great or terrible -- is that in theory they don't collide.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be an alternate reality in which Mookie Wilson's grounder does not go through Bill Buckner's legs, costing the Red Sox the 1986 World Series, but Mets fans in this one don't have to confront it. You don't have to engage with a universe in which you bought Apple stock while it was cheap, or with the wealthier, smarter you asking why you were such an idiot, but neither do you get to find out what would have happened if you had spoken to that woman at the art gallery that December night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if the alternate universes did collide? Could you encounter another version of yourself? Would you like yourself? What would you say?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Better luck next time,'' is the answer Rhoda Williams, an anguished young woman who has forsaken astrophysics for janitorial work, blurts to the man who is about to become her lover in the new film ''Another Earth,'' a meditation on guilt and redemption in crisscrossing worlds. Manohla Dargis's review in The New York Times called it ''a coming-of-adulthood story that improbably blends a plaintive drama with romantic longing and far-out science fiction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rhoda has earned her bleakness. Four years earlier, as a drunken teenager bound for M.I.T., she smashed into this same man's car, killing his wife, son and unborn child and leaving him in a coma. Drawn to him out of an urge for repentance after four years in prison but unable to confess who she is, Rhoda has entered a risky relationship, first as his housecleaner and then gradually more, with the man, John Burroughs, who was a famous composer before the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story gets its title from the discovery, on the same day as the accident, of what looks like a duplicate Earth, complete with moon and blue oceans. As this Earth gets closer and plans are made to send a space shuttle to it, Rhoda signs up on the hope that history might have gone differently there and that Burroughs's family is still alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie, directed by Mike Cahill and written by Mr. Cahill and Brit Marling, stars Ms. Marling as Rhoda and William Mapother as John Burroughs. It was first shown in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize for the best film with a science theme and a Special Jury Prize for drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Another Earth'' is not science fiction in the sense that we have to come to expect it -- there are no special effects or monsters other than the failings of human nature itself. Moreover, on one level, the science in ''Another Earth'' is silly. The sudden appearance of a duplicate Earth makes no astronomical sense and violates pretty much everything we know about gravity and about planetary orbits. Indeed, the Sloan judges debated whether there was enough science in the movie, according to Sean Carroll, a cosmologist at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the panel, before concluding that it represented a fanciful extrapolation of the idea, fashionable in physics and cosmology, of multiple universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So the movie doesn't teach you much physics, or even obey any set of coherent and plausible physical laws. But it borrows ideas from physics and uses them to launch a particular trajectory, which it then faithfully follows,'' Dr. Carroll said in an e-mail, calling the movie ''an excellent example of a certain kind of fruitful interaction between science and cinema.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple universes are all the rage these days. In quantum physics, where each throw of Heisenberg's dice can result in a different universe, they are called Many Worlds. In the reigning theory of the Big Bang there are ''pocket universes'' eternally forming and bubbling away from one another. In string theory there is a 10-dimensional ''landscape'' of an almost incalculable number of different universes, each of which is a solution to the basic string equations with different properties and perhaps even dimensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These theories solve many important problems, like why the universe we live in is fit for life -- we live where we can. But they also suggest that if you go far enough or wait long enough, everything that can happen will happen and we will run into duplicates of ourselves -- in fact an infinite number of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling, 27, and Mr. Cahill, 32, who were economics majors at Georgetown and met at a film festival there, said they didn't have cosmology or science fiction in mind when they started this film. In a joint interview on the eve of the film's premiere, Ms. Marling, fascinated by the notion of doppelgangers, said she was interested in a more ''macroscopic'' question: ''What would it be like if you could confront yourself?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The duplicate Earth, she said, appeared as a visual manifestation of this concept. They didn't know about multiple universes until someone sent them a copy of ''The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,'' by the Columbia University physicist Brian Greene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling said, ''We thought we were making this stuff up.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Cahill, who calls himself ''a hard-core science fiction geek,'' was listening to audio recordings of ''Pulp Physics,'' a history of astronomy by Richard Berendzen, a professor at American University. Entranced by his voice as well as by the grand drama of cosmic history, the filmmakers called him up and asked if he would be in the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling said, ''He understood that we were using science for poetry, for metaphor.'' In the movie he plays the role of narrator, ruminating on the radio about the meaning of the other Earth and the cosmic loneliness of humanity. ''Am I alone? We on Earth would like to know,'' he says. At another point he asks, ''Can I learn from the other me?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wisely, Mr. Cahill and Ms. Marling do not try to answer that or any of the other questions -- like whether doppelgangers will like each other -- the film raises. ''There is no wrong answer emotionally,'' Mr. Cahill said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cahill said that he considered ''Another Earth'' to be a science fiction movie despite the lack of computer graphics, heartbreaking vistas and other special effects that have come to characterize the genre. ''At heart,'' he said, ''sci-fi is a lot of ideas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marling chimed in to say that the goal of science fiction is to throw up a new lens on reality and get a bit closer to what it means to be human.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes in science fiction you can get closer to the truth than if you had followed all the rules,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's next Mars rover -- the ambitious, beleaguered, delayed Mars Science Laboratory -- finally has a destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission scientists announced Friday that the rover, a nuclear-powered vehicle the size of a small S.U.V., would head to Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide depression near the Martian equator. What attracted them there is a mountain that rises upward nearly three miles at the center, making it taller, for example, than Mount Rainier outside Seattle.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing about this mountain is it's not a tall spire,'' John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist, said at a news conference at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington. ''It's a broad, low, moundlike shape. What it means is we can drive up it with a rover. So this might be the tallest mountain anywhere in the solar system that we could actually climb with a rover.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists initially identified 100 possible landing sites, which were narrowed down to four finalists. All of the four were intriguing, Dr. Grotzinger said, and getting the scientists to agree on one was like getting a group of people to decide on one flavor of ice cream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the end, we picked the one that felt best,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheduled to launch after Thanksgiving, the Mars Science Laboratory -- less formally known as Curiosity -- is to arrive on Mars the following August, landing on the flat portion of the crater. The area is covered by sediments that were probably washed there by flowing water long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the rover climbs upward during its two-year mission, it will pass different geological layers, much like those at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like reading a novel,'' said Dr. Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology, ''and we think Gale Crater is going to be a great novel about the early environmental evolution of Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the rover will look at outcrops of clays and sulfates, minerals that form in the presence of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the rover continues to operate after two years, it could keep climbing up the mountain to investigate even more rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Science Laboratory is much bigger and heavier than the last two rovers NASA sent to Mars, Spirit and Opportunity. Unlike those two, which were solar-powered, Curiosity will generate its electrical power from heat produced by 10 pounds of plutonium. That will make it less susceptible to the changing Martian seasons and to dust storms that block sunlight. And it will mean that the rover can carry more sophisticated instruments, like a laser to vaporize pieces of rocks and machinery to identify elements of the resulting smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Science Laboratory was originally scheduled for launching two years ago, but it could not meet that target because of technical problems. NASA then had to wait until the orbital positions of Mars and Earth lined up again. In the meantime, the cost of the mission, originally estimated at $1.6 billion, has continued to rise: NASA announced in June another infusion of $44 million, bringing the current cost to $2.5 billion.</p>

The question now is whether the nation can summon the will to push hard for a far more ambitious set of manned voyages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for bold ventures is bleak. The United States is not abandoning human activities in space. American astronauts will be performing experiments on the International Space Station at least through 2020, but they will have to get there on Russian space craft. The earliest that American commercial companies could carry astronauts into nearby space might be 2015 or 2016.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has proposed more ambitious manned missions -- using technologies yet to be developed -- to an asteroid by 2025 and the orbit of Mars by the mid-2030s. Congress is, so far, unpersuaded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tough economic times, it is fair to ask why substantial money should be spent on manned space travel, especially since unmanned probes and space telescopes have produced much richer scientific findings. The answer is that manned missions are still the prime symbol of a nation's prowess in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We support President Obama's idea to send astronauts to places never visited before. Even lesser missions would make clear that the United States is not ceding the peaceful exploration of space at a time when others, notably China, are energetically pursuing their own programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's $18 billion budget is a tiny part of some $3.7 trillion in annual federal spending. Congress ought to provide enough money to keep the United States at the forefront of both human and robotic space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles had two crowning achievements: launching and repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, whose breathtaking images have revolutionized astronomy; and assembling the space station, a prodigious engineering feat. But the shuttles never lived up to their original promise of providing cheap, frequent, safe, reliable, trips to low-Earth orbit. And they turned out to be a lot more fragile than anyone realized; two were lost in catastrophic accidents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were pleased when President Obama sought to rejuvenate the space program by calling on NASA to develop ''game-changing'' technologies to provide cheaper and faster travel deep into space. But those plans were reined in when Congress virtually dictated that NASA use existing technologies to build a new heavy-lift rocket and crew capsule needed for such voyages. Many legislators are arguing for returning to the Moon first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now House Republicans want to cut NASA's spending for all programs, both manned and unmanned, by 10 percent below the president's request, with especially troubling cuts in some of the most important research areas. The House Appropriations Committee has approved a budget that would make deep cuts in planned spending on new space technologies, scale back NASA's two highest-priority unmanned missions -- to Mars and a moon of Jupiter -- and eliminate NASA's most important new space telescope (a successor to the Hubble), which is behind schedule and overbudget. NASA certainly needs to improve its efficiency. But it makes no sense to eviscerate programs that could yield cutting-edge technologies or important scientific findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have long ago grown blase with the shuttle missions. After three decades, we suppose that isn't surprising. We still believe that this country can do exciting things in space that can inspire a new generation.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the last space shuttle has landed back on Earth, a new generation of space entrepreneurs would like to whip up excitement about the prospect of returning to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spurred by a $30 million purse put up by <span class="companylink">Google</span>, 29 teams have signed up for a competition to become the first private venture to land on the Moon. Most of them are unlikely to overcome the financial and technical challenges to meet the contest deadline of December 2015, but several teams think they have a good shot to win -- and to take an early lead in a race to take commercial advantage of our celestial neighbor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, a flotilla of unmanned spacecraft could be headed Moonward within the next few years, with goals that range from lofty to goofy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Silicon Valley venture, Moon Express, is positioning itself as a future <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> for Moon deliveries: if you have something to send there, the company would like to take it. Moon Express was having a party on Thursday night to show off the flight capabilities of its lunar lander, based on technology it licensed from NASA, and ''to begin the next era of the private commercial race to the Moon,'' as the invitation put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the near future, the Moon Express lunar lander will be mining the Moon for precious resources that we need here on Earth,'' the invitation promised. ''Years from now, we will all remember we were there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naveen Jain, an Internet billionaire and a founder of Moon Express, says the company will spend $70 million to $100 million to try to win the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, but could recoup its investment on its first flight. He envisions selling exclusive broadcast rights for video from the Moon, as well as sponsorships, a la Nascar, for companies to put their logos on the lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, perhaps, a tie-in to reality television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wouldn't it be nice if you could have a 'Moon Idol,' just like 'American Idol?' '' suggested Mr. Jain, who previously founded <span class="companylink">Infospace</span> and Intelius. ''You take the top 10 contestants and play their voices on the Moon, record it and see who sounds the best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(There is no air on the Moon to transmit sound waves, but ''you could play it through the dust and see what it sounds like when you play it right on the surface,'' Mr. Jain said. His point was that with cheap lunar transportation, there was no predicting what might catch people's fancies.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another competitor, Astrobotic Technology, intends to sell berths on its lunar lander to space agencies and scientific institutions, which would pay $820,000 a pound to send up their experiments. The company, a spinoff from Carnegie Mellon University, is building a large craft -- much bigger than Moon Express's -- capable of carrying 240 pounds of payload (read: $200 million of cargo) and hopes to be ready to launch in December 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can make a lot of money even if we do not win the prize,'' said David Gump, president of Astrobotic, which is based in Pittsburgh. ''We will be making substantial profit on the first flight. Basically, we'll break even by selling a third of the payload.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X Prize competitors might all be beaten by landers and rovers that China, Russia and India plan to send up over the next couple of years. But those fall more in the mold of traditional, government-built science probes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA had wanted to send astronauts back to the Moon, its program was canceled last year, a victim of budget cuts and shifting priorities. But it has awarded $500,000 each to Moon Express, Astrobotic and a third competitor, Rocket City Space Pioneers, the first installments of up to $30 million that it will contribute to the X Prize efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Xenofos, manager of NASA's Innovative Lunar Demonstrations Data program, said he expected one or more teams to make it to the Moon. ''It's definitely not the technical issues that's stopping them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contestants' goals do not appear to face legal hurdles. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ratified by 100 nations, bars countries from claiming sovereignty over any part of the Moon, but does not prevent private companies from setting up shop. As for mining the Moon, it could fall under similar legal parameters as fishing in international waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some orbiting spacecraft have crashed into the Moon in recent years, 35 years have passed since anything from Earth made a soft landing there. To some people, this looks like an overdue invitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's probably the biggest wealth creation opportunity in modern history,'' said Barney Pell, a former NASA computer scientist turned entrepreneur and now a co-founder of Moon Express. While Moon Express might initially make money by sending small payloads, the big fortune would come from bringing back platinum and other rare metals, Dr. Pell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Long term, the market is massive, no doubt,'' he said. ''This is not a question of if. It's a question of who and when. We hope it's us and soon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the aviation prizes that jump-started airplane technology a century ago, the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize is meant to rally technologists and entrepreneurs. It is administered by the X Prize Foundation, which handed out $10 million in 2004 to the first private team to build a spacecraft that could carry people 60 miles above the Earth's surface. (The winner, SpaceShipOne, was built by the aerospace designer Burt Rutan with backing from Paul Allen, the software magnate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Moon competition, <span class="companylink">Google</span> put up $30 million. Of that, $20 million will go to the first team to land a spacecraft on the Moon, explore 500 meters and send back high-definition video and photos. The second team will win $5 million, and the remaining $5 million will pay for bonus prizes like surviving a frigid lunar night or traveling more than 5,000 meters on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the competitors see dollar signs in the Moon. Rocket City Space Pioneers, a consortium of businesses, is using its Moon effort largely to market technology that will allow multiple payloads to share one rocket, greatly reducing launching costs. (In other words, as the lander headed for the Moon, it could drop off a few satellites in orbit.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the Moon, it's so expensive, we don't know what the market is for sure in its entirety,'' said Tim Pickens, chief propulsion engineer at Dynetics, a company in Huntsville, Ala., that is leading the Rocket City effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at Moon Express, Mr. Jain's imagination runs wild. A robot could scrawl a marriage proposal in the lunar dust, take a picture and send it to the customer's beloved back on Earth. A time capsule filled with mementos or a strand of someone's hair -- and DNA -- could be sent to the Moon, where it would persist, pristine in the airless environs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People become part of moon exploration,'' Mr. Jain said, ''and that has never been done before.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last space shuttle flight rolled to a stop just before 6 a.m. on Thursday, closing an era in the nation's space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mission complete, Houston,'' said Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, commander of the shuttle Atlantis for the last flight. ''After serving the world for over 30 years, the space shuttle has earned its place in history, and it's come to a final stop.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing, the 19th before daylight at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, concluded the 135th shuttle mission. For the Atlantis, the final tally of its 26-year career was 33 missions, accumulating just under 126 million miles during 307 days in space and circumnavigating the Earth 4,848 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers used spray paint to mark the position of the Atlantis's wheels; a permanent marker will be placed on the runway to indicate the final resting spot of the space shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last day in space went smoothly. At 4:49 a.m., the Atlantis fired its maneuvering engines to slow down and begin its fall back into Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Descending in a northeast trajectory, it passed over the southeast Pacific Ocean and crossed Central America toward Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the International Space Station, Michael Fossum, a NASA astronaut, floated in the station's windowed cupola and observed the trail of hot plasma that marked Atlantis's re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than 10 minutes before landing, Captain Ferguson described the view from his window. ''Beautiful view of the Yucatan, I think, going right under the wing right now,'' he said. ''It's a gorgeous thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're looking good to us, Atlantis,'' responded Barry E. Wilmore, an astronaut at mission control in Houston. But he added a correction: ''You're just passing the west coast of Florida.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Huh? O.K.,'' Captain Ferguson said in surprise. ''I'm further than I thought we were.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the clear, windless predawn, twin sonic booms announced the impending arrival as the Atlantis slowed to less than the speed of sound. It made a wide turn to line up with the runway, concluding the 5,284,862-mile trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its 13-day mission, the Atlantis ferried 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts to the International Space Station and brought back some pieces, including a failed pump from the space station's cooling system, which engineers want to examine more closely. With the retirement of the shuttles, NASA will no longer be able to return large pieces of equipment back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will now begin the work of transforming the Atlantis into a museum piece. It will be mounted nearby at the space center's visitor center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the landing, Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, talked about the mixed emotions of the workers and NASA officials who had gathered on the runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw grown men and grown women crying today,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''Tears of joy, to be sure, and that was just human emotions came out on the runway today. You couldn't suppress them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was pride among the shuttle workers, Mr. Leinbach said, that even as the program was shutting down, they had maintained their high standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the past three or four years, we've been concentrating on completing the job we were given to do,'' he said. ''We've done that now, successfully. We have a lot of pride in that, and no one can take that away from us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But jobs will be taken away. Although no NASA government employees have been laid off, the jobs of NASA contractors working in the shuttle program were cut deeply as the program wound down. Three years ago, 15,000 people worked at the Kennedy Space Center. As of Thursday, employment had fallen to 11,500. It is expected to drop soon to 8,200 before edging up to 10,000 in a few years as new NASA programs begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardest hit is United Space Alliance, the company that handled the maintenance of the shuttles and prepared each one for flight. It will lay off 46 percent of its 5,200 workers in the coming weeks. Nearly all of the 1,643 workers losing their jobs in Florida will be out the door on Friday, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landing,'' said Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman, ''really was a heck of a last day for them.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH the final space shuttle mission scheduled to end this morning when Atlantis glides to earth, and with only uncertainty to follow for NASA's manned spaceflight program, this may seem like the moment to weep for the lost promise of the space age.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not. I have shed tears of wonder and awe at the scale and achievement of NASA's manned spaceflight program, but not for its inexorable end. The close of this phase of space exploration is long overdue. And what appears to be an epic conclusion is, like much of NASA's history, an elegant mirage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005 and 2006, I regularly took a long, slow bus ride from the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., where I was a research fellow, to the warehouse where the Smithsonian stores its Apollo spacesuits. Dry-cleaned by NASA after their return to earth and meticulously preserved since, the suits remain stained, indelibly, with gray-black moon dust. Their surface, a wrinkled study in chiaroscuro, seems alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, as I rode back to Washington, I saw the full moon rise into view. Preoccupied with earthly concerns, I was startled to tears by the vertigo of having spent the day with those moon-stained spacesuits, objects in human shape that had touched heaven and returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mine were not the shining tears of Walter Cronkite, unforgettably captured on television on July 20, 1969, as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon. But he and I must have felt that same marvelous mixture of delight and awe, terror and relief, at the scale of human achievement and the shift in history that hinged on a footstep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We easily forget, however, that the heroic venture had one essential justification: life-and-death geopolitics. In the hot center of the cold war, statecraft was also space-borne stagecraft. After the Soviet Union launched Yuri Gagarin into outer space in 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson: ''Is there any other space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win?'' Johnson's advisers in recommending a moon landing included not only scientists but also Frank Stanton, the president of CBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Props and costumes mattered in this theater of war. That NASA's equipment should be painted white, and feature no military shields or corporate brands but only ''USA,'' ''NASA'' and the flag, was a deliberate decision by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Yet American rockets were nevertheless cobbled together from instruments of war, their craftsmen drawn from the same network of systems engineers that was devised to manage the arms race and its doomsday scenarios. Our first astronauts went to space hunched into an improvised capsule atop ICBM's, squatting in place of warheads. The brilliance with which the resulting achievements shone was -- like a diamond's -- the result of terrible pressure. We should be glad that this era is past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the dazzling image of midcentury spaceflight obscures its dark origins, close scrutiny of the Apollo spacesuit reveals a different and more robust approach to innovation -- one that should inspire us at this uncertain moment in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the Apollo program, the conventional wisdom was that the spacesuits would be like the rockets: adamantine, metallic, armored and smooth. But repeatedly, prototypes of such suits failed under pressure. In the end, the Apollo spacesuit was made in a more unassuming fashion: needle-sewn by seamstresses taken from the shop floor of Playtex, the bra and girdle company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit was stitched together from 21 layers of different materials as varied as Teflon and Lycra. Each solved a specific problem -- from durability (the white fiberglass exterior) to restraining the balloonlike pressure bladder against the astronaut's body (brassiere-grade nylon). The suit was a literal patchwork of improvisations and adaptations, the kind of invention that typically takes place in the garage, not the lab. Indeed, the suit's head engineer, Leonard Sheperd, was a former television repairman from Queens who was recruited to Playtex after he artfully fixed the television set of the company's founder, Abram Spanel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of this ''soft'' approach -- ad hoc, individualistic, pragmatic -- should be a lesson to us. The institutional culture and mismanaged expectations of the space shuttle program have contributed, not once but twice, to the destruction of craft and crew. It was not a mere faulty O-ring or insulation fragment that threatened the Challenger and Columbia; it was, as the presidential commission that investigated the Challenger disaster concluded, a tragic disconnect between NASA's bureaucracy and the real-world complexities of engineering for space. ''For a successful technology,'' the physicist Richard Feynman wrote in his appendix to the commission's report, ''reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the shuttle's extraordinary achievements, it came to illustrate how ill-suited the military-industrial enterprise is to the only enduring rationales for manned spaceflight: heroism, pure delight and the essential expansion of human possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As entrepreneurial endeavors like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Virgin Galactic arise to fill our new gap in manned spacecraft, we have reason to be optimistic. In the same farewell address in which he cautioned against the undue influence of ''the military-industrial complex,'' Eisenhower also issued a second, less-remembered warning, against the related prospect of a world in which a ''government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such curiosity and its astonishing consequences, as exemplified by the Apollo spacesuit, is likely to flourish more richly outside the organizational constraints and corporate shell of post-Apollo NASA. And so will continue to inspire us all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supernova was detected in 1987 in a small galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 160,000 light-years away. It occurred when an aging star's core collapsed, creating a violent explosion visible to the naked eye from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light from the supernova highlighted a giant ring of material more than six million miles long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herschel, which was sent into orbit in 2009, was able to detect very cold dust particles in the ring. The dust in the center of the star's remains is about minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Matsuura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her team reported that the explosion generated enough cold dust to form more than 200,000 Earths. Such explosions are enough, they believe, to create the large clouds of dust seen in young galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By studying this dust using Herschel and other telescopes, the researchers hope to better understand how galaxies, including the Milky Way, are formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Planets are made from interstellar dust, and so are all creatures on planets,'' said Michael Barlow, another astronomer at University College London and a co-author of the study. ''We are made of interstellar dust, ultimately.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the space shuttle carries out its final mission to the space station orbiting 220 miles above the globe, NASA's plan to conduct far more important research from a telescope that would be perched almost a million miles from Earth is in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The James Webb Space Telescope is running way over budget, is way behind schedule and is draining money from other important space science programs. There is no easy solution to this budgetary problem, but it would be premature to terminate the program, as a House Appropriations subcommittee voted to do last week, without taking a much deeper look at whether this immensely important research platform can be saved.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope is the planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has revolutionized astronomy over the past two decades, discovered hundreds of proto-galaxies, and helped establish the age and expansion rate of the universe. The more powerful Webb telescope is designed to detect even more distant objects and stars being formed even further back in time. The National Academy of Sciences ranked it the highest-priority astronomy research project to be started in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When NASA committed to the project in 2008, the Webb was expected to cost $5 billion and be launched in 2014. The expected costs have since soared to $6.5 billion, with the earliest launching date delayed to 2018 if annual funding is increased, and even later if it is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Webb's cutting-edge technologies cost more than early estimates, its technical development is going well. The problem, a review panel concluded last November, is that an unreasonably low budget and poor management by NASA forced the program to keep deferring work to subsequent years, which drives up costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delays now threaten to gobble up money that would otherwise be spent on other research projects in the coming decade, like a $1.6 billion satellite telescope that would investigate the mysterious ''dark energy'' that may be accelerating the universe's expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of killing the Webb project, Congress should let NASA accelerate testing to determine whether the complicated instrument is likely to work as expected; most repairs in space would be impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics should remember that the Hubble telescope also experienced technical difficulties, cost overruns and a mistake by a manufacturer that created a devastating optical problem until a shuttle crew could repair it. Yet in the end, the Hubble offered a rich scientific payoff. The Webb's scientific payoff could be even richer.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was two weeks before the liftoff of the Apollo 11 mission when Thomas Moser's boss walked into his office at NASA and announced, ''We're putting a flag on the moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moser, then a 30-year-old mechanical engineer, was put in charge of designing a flag mechanism that could not only fit into the lunar module and survive the flight, but also make the flag appear to fly on the windless moon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His solution involved two sections of a staff, a telescoping tube and a nylon flag bought at a local housing goods store (Sears, he thinks). But in order for the flag to fit the staff, its edges needed to be trimmed. ''They were throwing it all in the trash,'' Mr. Moser recalled of the remnants in a recent interview, ''so I picked it up out of the trash can, mounted it and had Neil Armstrong sign it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-two years later, Mr. Moser is auctioning off those flag remnants. The expected selling price: $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's so much attention on the manned space program right now that the timing may be good,'' Mr. Moser said, referring to the final launching of the space shuttleAtlantis on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moser's flag shreds are the star lot of an extensive space memorabilia auction being held in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Sunday. Other notable items include the astronaut Deke Slayton's handwritten training notes from the Mercury program and dozens of heat shields, crew patches and other ephemera that once transcended earthly bounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For collectors, the remnants of the space flag are ''comparable to a Betsy Ross flag or the flag flying over the port in Baltimore in 1812,'' said Michael Orenstein, who is overseeing the auction for Goldberg Coins and Collectibles. Two days before the auction, online pre-bidding for the lot had reached $49,999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But trading in space nostalgia can be a dangerous business. In June, investigators confiscated a triangular nub of transparent tape an eighth of an inch wide from an auction house in St. Louis because it contained tiny particles of moon dust. Selling moon rocks, no matter how small, is illegal, as is selling NASA property that the agency has not willingly disposed of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Orenstein said that his auction contained no moon particles, and that all NASA property in the sale had been discarded by the agency long ago. A NASA spokesman declined to comment on the status of the items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also economic concerns. The collectibles market tends to follow the overall economy; when money is tight, even avid collectors are less likely to spend money on memorabilia. But Mr. Orenstein said he believed that rule did not apply to one-of-a-kind items like the flag remnants. ''Just give me two flag collectors who can't live without it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Moser, he does not plan to attend the auction, but he was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday to watch the Atlantis lift off. ''I spent most of my life developing the shuttle,'' said Mr. Moser, who retired from NASA in 1989 after 25 years with the agency. ''I was there from sketch pad to launch pad.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many of the stories that temporarily unite the United States are tragic, even cataclysmic. Shooting sprees. Trial verdicts. Bombings. Acts of God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are those awe-inspiring acts of man, the launchings of space shuttles -- or there were, until Friday, when the final flight erupted from the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center. Television networks interrupted their daytime shows and peered skyward for the liftoff, proving one final time that the medium that came of age during the Apollo missions played a pivotal role in explaining and exciting the American people about space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the reporters and broadcasters who had witnessed dozens of other launchings sounded spellbound by the liftoff on Friday. ''You feel as though they are kind of like ripping a hole in the sky,'' the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper said from his makeshift studio near the site as he and his colleagues were blinded by the light of the solid rocket boosters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to imagine a better made-for-television uplifting event,'' said Miles O'Brien, the science correspondent for the ''PBS NewsHour,'' who grew up watching the Apollo missions to the moon on television. In an interview after the launching, Mr. O'Brien said of NASA missions, ''They offer spectacle, adventure, danger, excitement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades NASA supplied the breathtaking pictures and television networks provided the breathless anchors, giving rise to charges that news organizations were cheerleaders for the space program. ''Using the media has enabled NASA to reach a large audience at little cost,'' Mark E. Byrnes observed in the 1994 book ''Politics and Space: Image Making by NASA.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet that audience dwindled quickly after the first flight in 1981 as the missions turned routine, or at least seemed that way to the television executives who decided to stop showing live liftoffs. ''It got blase,'' said Jay Barbree of NBC, who covered every manned space mission. ''And then Challenger happened.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNN, then five years old, was the only television outlet to show the explosion that destroyed the Challenger as it happened in 1986. The image of the explosion remains dominant in the minds of Americans, asserted Mr. O'Brien, a former CNN correspondent. ''In some respects, television brought to America the limits of technology in space, in the form of the shuttle,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That tragedy, and the break-up of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, led to brief spikes in television coverage of the NASA program and its subsequent flights into space, but the program faded from the imaginations of ordinary people -- in part because there was little interest in it inside television news offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was difficult over the years to ''sell'' space shuttle coverage, the longtime CNN correspondent John Zarrella said. He partly blamed NASA. The administration ''has never done a very good job of promoting the space shuttle program or promoting itself,'' he said Thursday in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recalled visiting a NASA archive and seeing a stunning high-definition video segment of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. He said, ''We went, 'Wow, where's all this stuff been?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zarrella asked, ''Would there have been more national support for the shuttle program, for NASA, and would there have been more public outcry about the end of the shuttle program if NASA had done a better job promoting itself? I don't know the answer to that, but it's worth asking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Brien, similarly, said he had ''beaten my head against the wall for 20 years on this issue.'' On top of science phobia among some newsroom bosses, he said, NASA was not savvy enough about giving access to astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They,'' he said, referring to NASA, ''protected the astronauts way too much in an era when they should have been pushing them out'' to the news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, countless Americans found themselves attuned at one time or another to NASA TV, a bare-bones cable channel with raw coverage of missions, or to the Twitter accounts for individual astronauts. The broadcasts, particularly early on, also motivated young people to pursue science and engineering positions in untold ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The inspiration of dreams among aspiring engineers can't be calculated in TV ratings,'' Joshua King, a longtime shuttle-watcher, wrote in an e-mail. Mr. King, now the head of marketing and communications at Willis, the global insurance broker, said the coverage did not make him an engineer, but did make him ''a person who tries to think like one.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- There was a time, some of us remember, when a countdown at Canaveral stopped the world in its tracks. On television or at the launching, every breath was held at liftoff and every eye followed the fiery plume of ascent, up and away. Godspeed, said someone who was everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a half century ago, when men first squeezed into their machines and, defying gravity, rode into a new dimension of human experience. Unbound to Earth, our species could imagine that an age of spacefaring was truly under way, the Moon and Mars within reach, maybe even an asteroid where the Little Prince awaited our visit. The promised new reality legitimized fantasies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atmosphere here on Friday at the launching of the space shuttleAtlantis was, in some respects, reminiscent of the old days. The crowd was the largest in years, attracted by the last chance for no telling how long to see astronauts in this country leave for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything was class-reunion festive. The gray-hairs recharged memories from youth. Their grandchildren trooped along to see what had turned people on when there were just a few channels of black-and-white TV and the only telephone in the house was at the end of a cord -- and the only ones twittering were sparrows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rain clouds hovered ominously and the countdown began to the 135th departure in the 30-year-old shuttle program, the milling crowd grew still and anxious. There was concern for the four lives in the winged space plane, of course, and all eyes searched for the break in the clouds that finally came. But this time, more than ever, spectators and others who care about NASA worried for nothing less than the future of human spaceflight in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've come full circle since 1961, back to when we had yet to show we could launch people into space,'' said Steven J. Dick, a retired NASA chief historian. ''We will be hitching rides from the Russians to go to the space station that is mainly ours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony of having to send our astronauts up in Russian Soyuz capsules is as plain as cold war history. The Soviet Union's early dominance of space, manifested by the Sputnik surprise in 1957 and subsequent feats, prompted the United States to match and then surpass the Soviets in a program topped off by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Human spaceflight would have come along anyway, but not with quite the urgency of the Soviet-American competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreseeing the end of shuttle flights, the Obama administration and NASA last year proposed new plans, approved by Congress, to develop heavy-lift rockets for sending people deeper into space, to be ready perhaps after 2020. Meanwhile, NASA has begun financing research for intermediate crew-only spacecraft to be produced and launched by commercial companies, probably no sooner than 2016. Such plans, of course, are at the mercy of the budget cutting and government downsizing spreading in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori B. Garver, the deputy administrator of NASA, insisted this week that the future was bright for human spaceflight. ''We are tapping into how we developed almost everything great in this country, through commercial enterprise and competition,'' Ms. Garver said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other NASA officials noted that Congressional support for the new programs was bipartisan. But they acknowledged that budget cuts were possible, and would ultimately take a toll on launching capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, a space policy expert and the author of ''John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon,'' said there had been gaps in human flight before, especially after Apollo flights ended in 1975 and the first shuttles flew in 1981. ''We can accept that as long as a replacement is in the pipeline,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''But we are ending programs with no sure follow-ons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dick, the historian, questioned whether the barely started new programs would be ready to boost this country's astronauts into orbit in this decade. ''We're stuck in the short term, can't rouse ourselves to do much that's inspiring,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever happened to the space age as imagined back in the 1950s and early '60s, when science fiction writers and rocket scientists spun tales of travel out in the solar system and beyond? Propellants, oxygen and other good stuff never seemed limited, or radiation a risk, or Congressional budgets a curse. This alternate universe appealed to some in a society flush with confidence after winning the Second World War but feeling a bit confined in the postwar gray-flannel conformity. Americans seemed to have lost none of their can-do spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one disputes that the space age is here to stay. Think of how much our day-to-day lives depend on the herds of satellites occupying orbital space, the world community's commons. They are integral to communications, social media, business transactions, military operations and surveillance, surveys for charting world resources and climate and the G.P.S. devices that help us keep track of ourselves and others. As an inspiring bonus, other robotic instruments have extended human curiosity to the very edge of the solar system and out to the galaxies, close to cosmic beginnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does not assuage the lingering disappointment of some of those who grew up with the space age, the countdowns, the Moon walks, the unpiloted encounters with other planetary worlds and the touchdowns on the russet plains of Mars. For various reasons, the spread of no-can-do limits has swept aside the optimism with which Americans met the initial challenges of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apollo lunar-landing successes, restoring national pride and asserting pre-eminence in space technology, reduced the immediate geopolitical pressures driving human space efforts. The Nixon administration rejected NASA's post-Apollo plans for permanent Moon bases, orbiting space stations and flights to Mars. Flying reusable space shuttles was NASA's consolation prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the vehicles had their triumphs servicing the Hubble Space Telescope and assembling the International Space Station, they never came close to living up to the extravagant promise to make spaceflight more efficient and economical, approaching the reliability of aviation. The Challenger and Columbia disasters set back the program, which never approached an early objective to fly every few weeks at a cost of only $7 million (it was more like $1.5 billion a mission).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles consigned American astronauts to low orbits, going round and round, unable to strike out to distant destinations. Spaceflight dropped off the front pages -- though on Saturday, all will report the successful launching of the Atlantis, at 11:29 a.m. Eastern time Friday, two and a half minutes behind schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies of the effects of long-duration space travel by Russian and American scientists have introduced cautionary notes tempering the early enthusiasm for astronaut trips to Mars lasting several years. M. G. Lord , the author of a memoir, ''Astro Turf,'' on growing up in the aerospace culture in California, suggested that these findings contributed to a growing awareness that our bodies are far more fragile than science fiction writers thought when they concocted wide-ranging colonization scenarios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These days my pet fantasy for exploring the universe has to do with downloading human consciousness to machines -- silicon is more resilient than flesh,'' Ms. Lord said, her imagination by no means grounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty-one years after the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 707 was rolled out as the first commercially successful jet airliner, as Howard E. McCurdy, a historian at American University and author of ''Space and the American Imagination,'' pointed out the other day. He was acknowledging that aviation offered no guidance for how space travel was likely to unfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimistic Dr. McCurdy noted that private entrepreneurs continued to invest in space technology and transport systems and that ''other nations clamor to join the spacefaring club.'' The persistence of this vision in the face of adversity, he said, suggests that space travel reflects ''an elemental need.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By dawn Friday, cars and Winnebagos lined the sides of roadways with prime views as hundreds of thousands of people came to watch the 135th flight in the space shuttle program. The program, which began in 1981, comes to an end when the Atlantis' wheels roll to a stop on the runway in two weeks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to NASA, the luminaries who came included Joe Gibbs, the former Washington Redskins football coach; Steve Wozniak, co-founder of <span class="companylink">Apple Computer</span>; and the singer Jimmy Buffett. So did 14 members of Congress; John Holdren, the president's science adviser; Eric Holder, the United States attorney general; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and two former NASA administrators, Daniel Goldin and Michael Griffin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Robert L. Crippen, a retired Navy captain who was the pilot of the first shuttle flight, came to watch the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last shuttle flight also contained a piece of the first flight. The shuttle's solid rocket boosters are recovered and refurbished, and the top segment of the left booster that helped lift the Atlantis off the ground on Friday first flew on the first flight, on April 12, 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis is carrying 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With storms rumbling around the area, forecasts had given just a 30 percent chance of favorable weather for the launching of the Atlantis. ''We had a decent shot at it,'' Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, said, explaining the decision early Friday to begin pumping more than half a million gallons of rocket fuel into the external fuel tank despite the uncertain forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rain stayed away, the clouds thinned, and the countdown, which encountered no significant setbacks, continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Good luck, Godspeed and have a little fun up there,'' Mr. Leinbach said to the crew after his team gave the go-ahead for the final few minutes of countdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commander of Atlantis, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, thanked Mr. Leinbach and the launching team. Noting the end of the shuttle era, he added: ''The shuttle is always going to be a reflection of what a great nation can do when it dares to be bold and commits to follow through. We're not ending the journey today, Mike, we're completing a chapter in a journey that will never end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 31 seconds before the scheduled liftoff, the countdown clock halted. An electronic signal indicated that the ''beanie cap'' that vents oxygen gas from the external fuel tank had failed to retract. But by looking at video images, mission controllers confirmed that the arm had indeed fully retracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 11:29 a.m. -- two and a half minutes later than scheduled -- the engines of the Atlantis ignited to propel it to orbit with its crew of four: Capt. Ferguson; Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the Marines; Sandra H. Magnus; and Rex J. Walheim, a retired Air Force colonel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a minute, the shuttle, leaving behind a thick plume of smoke, disappeared into the clouds. Although the spacecraft was out of sight, the still-rising plume cast a shadow onto the clouds to mark its trajectory to space, and the Atlantis reached orbit in eight and a half minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts will spend Saturday inspecting the heat shield and are to dock at the space station on Sunday. The mission is scheduled to last 12 days, with Atlantis returning to Earth on July 20, but NASA officials hope to stretch out the last flight one additional day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a post-launching news conference, NASA officials repeated assertions that the end of the space shuttle program does not mean the end of human spaceflight and that American astronauts will continue to travel to the International Space Station, albeit on Russian rockets for at least several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't do something else, you can't do something better, unless you go through change,'' said Robert D. Cabana, director of the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Atlantis had reached orbit and their job was done, members of the launching team lingered in the control room, Mr. Leinbach said. ''It seemed we didn't want to leave,'' he said. ''It was like the end of a party, and you just don't want to go. You just want to hang around a little bit longer and relish our friends and what we've accomplished.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- As the scheduled launching of the final space shuttle approached, Tom and Jo Foley were having a dispute about the future of Space World U.S.A., the mom-and-pop souvenir shop they have run since 1968. He believes they should retire; she wants to stay open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may sell,'' said Mr. Foley, 82, whose trinket-crammed NASA memorabilia shop is Florida's oldest. ''We just don't want to give people the impression the store is giving up on the space program.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, we'll never sell the shop,'' Mrs. Foley, who does not tell her age, playfully retorted. ''He would just curl up and die without it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So go conversations up and down the Space Coast, where aeronautics are as culturally ingrained as sandy beaches and surfboard shops. Everyone feels the impact of the shuttle program's ending after 30 years and 135 flights, and questions about the area's future far outnumber answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttles have launched here, on average, every three months since 1981 -- a ritual that is expected to draw up to a million people on Friday at 11:26 a.m. when, weather permitting, the Atlantis is scheduled to take its final flight. (NASA says there is a 70 percent chance the launching will be delayed by rainy weather.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kennedy Space Center employs 13,000 people, and many thousands more work for aerospace contractors. Then there are businesses like the Foleys' -- on the order of NASA-themed restaurants and surfboard shops that take spectators on the water to watch the launchings -- that are bolstered by a regular tide of shuttle tourists. All of this in a county with 10.8 percent unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest focus economically is going to be keeping these talented, highly educated people in the area,'' said Bill Moore, the chief operating officer of the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex. ''We all have friends or husbands or brothers at the space center, and they're looking for work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space center contractors have already announced 7,000 layoffs this year. And local officials worry about declining tourism as baby boomers age and memories of the golden age of space travel fade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marsha Getkey, the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Titusville, a city where many space center workers live, said it felt a little like the closing of a town's main factory. ''When a shuttle launch happens, people here don't just hear a rumble and look up,'' she said. ''You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't know the launch time and land time. It's that much a part of the community's fabric.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has created an atmosphere both nostalgic and celebratory around the space center, where visitors were already gathering Thursday to watch ''Star Trek'' movies, buy memorabilia and stake out viewing spots. Tickets to watch the launching from the best locations were selling for up to $1,200 online, as much as Super Bowl tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're here to watch history, but we're also here to watch something become history,'' said Steve Allen, 64, an engineer from Colorado Springs who brought his family of five, all outfitted in blue NASA shirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space center is expecting its largest crowd for a launching, despite the rain. Many tourists said they had dreamed of attending a NASA launching since the cold war, and splurged on the last opportunity of this kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I bought a one-way ticket from South Korea,'' said Michael Kim, 57, an engineer. ''If it rains, I will just wait. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. I'm staying put.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert E. Hunter, a historian from Chicago, persuaded his wife, Nancy Grim Hunter, to attend what he called a ''once-in-a-lifetime'' event: a trip that cost each of them about $1,000, including travel, rental car and souvenirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of times America gets criticized for what it does in the world,'' he said. ''But you think about the space program. It's something that doesn't hurt anyone, isn't imperialistic and is almost universally uplifting and inspiring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Wyles, 70, a retired <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> employee who lives near the center, has watched every launching since 1981. She has a routine -- sitting in her backyard with her grandchildren and her Chihuahua, Mojo, and counting down from 10 to zero -- that she will follow again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to look the same,'' she said. ''But the feelings are going to be so much different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore said that only 5 percent of those who toured the visitors complex came for shuttle launching. But he said the space center planned to create new attractions involving unmanned and private space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The NASA story is not clear right now. It's still being written,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But even in this tumultuous time, it's going to be an historic weekend.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope, named after a former administrator of NASA, is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it was designed to study the first stars and galaxies that emerged in the first hundred million years or so after the Big Bang.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was supposed to be launched in 2014, but NASA said last year that the project would require at least an additional $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, because of mismanagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week, NASA announced that it had finished polishing all the segments of the telescope's mirror, which is 6.5 meters in diameter, but the agency has still not announced a new plan for testing and launching the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the telescope's potential demise came as part of a draft budget for NASA and other agencies, including the Commerce and Justice Departments. In all, the committee proposed lopping $1.6 billion off NASA's current budget, which is $18.4 billion for 2011. The Obama administration had originally requested $18.7 billion for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reacted with immediate dismay, fearing that the death of the Webb telescope could have the same dire impact on American astronomy that killing the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator in Texas, did in 1993 for American physics, sending leadership abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canceling the Webb telescope would ''have a profound impact on astrophysics far into the future, threatening U.S. leadership in space science,'' said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which would run the new telescope. ''This is particularly disappointing at a time when the nation is struggling to inspire students to take up science and engineering,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, echoed his view. ''This would be an unmitigated disaster for cosmology,'' he said. ''After two decades of pushing the Hubble to its limits, which has revolutionized astronomy, the next step would be to pack up and give up. The Hubble is just good enough to see what we're missing at the start of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope, he said, ''would bring it home in full living color.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Appropriation Committee's proposal was the opening act in what is likely to be a long political drama, in which the Senate will eventually have a say. The measure is expected to be approved Thursday by the subcommittee in charge of NASA and the other agencies, according to Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wednesday the full Appropriations Committee will meet again to consider the final bill.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Normally, when NASA launches a space shuttle, there are either six or seven astronauts aboard. So why, on the 135th and final launching of the 30-year-old space shuttle program, will there be only four?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, perhaps not surprisingly, has to do with the Atlantis's being the last flight: With no spare shuttle available to go and rescue the astronauts in case something goes wrong, the Americans would have to turn to the Russians to retrieve their crew from the International Space Station. And the Russian spacecraft -- known as Soyuz capsules -- hold only three astronauts, so two people would have to fly up and bring home the Americans one at a time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very low likelihood case,'' Atlantis's commander, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, said last week during a news conference. But the agency's safety experts have ''done an extraordinarily thorough job of making sure we have a good plan to get home,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis is scheduled to leave from here at 11:26 a.m. on Friday, making its 33rd flight. But the forecast on Wednesday was for only a 30 percent chance of acceptable weather, so the launching could be delayed until Sunday or beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, the countdown was proceeding smoothly. ''There are no problems yet,'' Michael P. Moses, the launching integration manager, said Wednesday at a news conference. ''There are just weather forecasts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And about a million spectators are expected to show up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's other two orbiters, the Discovery and the Endeavour, have completed their flying careers and are being primped for display in museums. The Atlantis was supposed to be retired now, too. NASA had prepared it as a rescue vehicle for the last flight of the Endeavour, in May, and it would have gotten off the ground only if the Endeavour had encountered trouble while in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after spending hundreds of millions of dollars getting the Atlantis ready to fly, NASA officials said it made sense to fly it regardless, to carry additional supplies to the space station. And this decision required alternate contingency plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the explosion of the Columbia eight years ago, which killed the seven astronauts on board, the space agency carefully drew up plans for what to do if an orbiter reached space safely but was damaged and could not return. Columbia was damaged during liftoff when a piece of debris struck one of its wings, creating a hole that caused the shuttle to break up on its way back to earth. Investigators subsequently concluded that the problem could have been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For each post-Columbia shuttle trip to the International Space Station, astronauts have inspected the orbiter's underside for damage to the heat shield similar to the puncture in Columbia's left wing caused by falling foam. The plan was that if any such damage were found, the astronauts would remain at the space station until the next shuttles arrived and carried them home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, if there were such a problem, it would be the smaller, three-seat Soyuz capsules that brought the astronauts home. Over the following year, the Soyuzes would launch with a crew of two instead of three, and a shuttle astronaut would take the empty seat on the return trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extended stay for seven stranded shuttle astronauts, in addition to the station's six crew members, would exhaust the station's food and supplies. But with four unexpected guests, the strain on the station would be manageable. ''We'll be able to, I think, sort of assimilate into space station life fairly straightforwardly, if it would happen,'' said Sandra H. Magnus, a member of the Atlantis crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four astronauts -- Captain Ferguson; Col. Douglas G. Hurley of the Marines; Dr. Magnus; and Rex J. Walheim, a retired Air Force colonel -- are experienced space fliers, and all four will be busy during the 12-day mission, moving 8,000 pounds of supplies and spare parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having four folks who have done this at least once in the past will add dramatically to our efficiency on orbit,'' Captain Ferguson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there may be some advantages to the smaller crew. ''There are less opinions to contend with,'' Captain Ferguson said, drawing some laughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the last day before landing is expected to be particularly hectic, with the four performing tasks usually divided among six or seven. The Atlantis is to return to Kennedy Space Center on July 20, although NASA could extend the mission by a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the retirement of the shuttles, NASA will be counting on two companies, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif., and <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span>, of Dulles, Va., to carry supplies to the space station. The additional Atlantis flight provides a cushion in case of further delays by the companies, keeping the station supplied through next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for short, successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket twice last year, but will get at most one off the ground this year. The next flight, a demonstration to show that it can navigate its space capsule to the station, has been delayed from spring to late fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Orbital suffered a setback last month when an engine for its rocket caught fire in testing. Orbital still hopes to launch a demonstration flight this year and begin taking supplies to the station next year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By April 1981 it seemed that the space shuttle Columbia had been part of the Florida landscape forever. Gleaming white in the sun by day and the floodlights that bathed it all night, the cluster of rockets, space plane and giant egglike fuel tank looked like a craggy Matterhorn transposed to the humid coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was surely too big to ever move, and yet the fate of the nation seemed to depend on its doing so. Months earlier I had traveled with a group of science writers on a weeklong junket through the nation's space centers. In California, we walked underneath the next shuttle, Challenger, where Rockwell workers were gluing the fragile heat-resistant tiles to its body. At Cape Canaveral, our private jet touched down on the shuttle landing strip and we were taken within hailing distance of the waiting shuttle, close enough to see soldiers patrolling the launching pad with machine guns.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle was a big deal then. But now, after 30 years of shuttle flights, the last mission ever is being prepped for its launching on Friday. Humans are no closer to the stars than before, and the space program is in tatters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until that trip past the pad in 1981, the space program was something I had watched on a grainy little black-and-white TV at my apartment in Cambridge, Mass. Raised on science fiction, I knew the script: First we take the Moon, then Mars. That in fact was the vision pushed in 1969 by NASA's administrator, Thomas O. Paine, and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, but President Richard M. Nixon didn't bite and history didn't go according to plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1981, a decade after the glories of the Apollo Moon landings, it had been six years since Americans had last ventured into space, and editorialists were lamenting the ''retreat from space.'' The reusable space shuttle was supposed to make spaceflight cheap and almost as routine as air travel, and satellite launchings as uneventful as delivering the mail. There was money to be made in space and a slate of ''black missions'' to keep the nation secure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shuttle was late and over budget. Those thermal tiles, vital to protecting it from the searing heat of re-entry, had an embarrassing habit of flaking off. Some people called it the Flying Brickyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, overruns and delays had drastically depleted the agency's resources for science. NASA couldn't even afford to send a mission to Halley's Comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the scientists I know would be thrilled to see humans exploring space, landing on Mars, for example -- they just don't think that science should pick up the check. Many of them were suspicious of the shuttle, both because of the cost drain and because making instruments like the space telescope compatible with it would compromise the potential science, restricting them to low earth orbit, for example, and making them hostage to the exigencies of human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But politically, if not technically, the shuttle and the space telescope needed each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mountain did move on April 12, 1981. We got up at midnight to drive on back roads through Cape Canaveral Air Station and then eat peanut butter crackers in our cars waiting for the dawn and the new space age. When the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets went off, it was like a second sunrise blasting our greasy faces. The Alps vanished atop a biblical tower of smoke and flame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, when John W. Young and Robert L. Crippen glided back down in the Mojave Desert, the double crack of Columbia's sonic boom sounded like a message from the gods. Elated to be arriving in dignity like test pilots rather than cargo plopping into the ocean, the astronauts proceeded to strut around the shuttle inspecting it for nicks and dings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, soon we were in the era of the space truck to nowhere, easy travel to orbit and the sight of astronauts frolicking like weightless baby sea lions in the capacious shuttle decks and laboratories. Women, scientists, a congressman and a senator, not to mention an array of guest astronauts from other countries, logged time in orbit, performing scientific experiments, often on one another. Captain Young, who had been to the Moon twice, redefined the notion of the ''right stuff'' when he was pictured in his command chair in his reading glasses looking over flight plans. Judith A. Resnik redefined it further when her long curly locks floated on orbit like a dark corona about her head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald E. McNair, a physicist, brought his saxophone to play in space. There was talk of flying a schoolteacher in space, and even a journalist. We learned that about a third of astronauts suffered bouts of space sickness, until NASA declared that such topics were not fit for public discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was thrilling to watch astronauts blast off on smoke pillars, but after a while it was irritating that they weren't going anywhere but in circles around the Earth and the science they were doing was mostly boring compared with the results being beamed back from the Voyager spacecraft exploring the outer planets at considerably less expense and risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why were we there? I recall one newspaper reporter asking out loud at one launching before answering himself. ''We're on a death watch,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle had been declared ''operational'' after four flights, but it could never be routine. Gravity might be the weakest force in nature, as the physicists tell us, but the violence needed to overcome it and release us from the Earth was revelatory to me when I actually saw it in action up close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then I totally bought the idea of reusable spacecraft -- after all, the space age had begun with rocket planes like the X-15 that went up and glided back down. But the shuttle's design had been compromised by politics and economics -- a more expensive and safer version would have put the crew far above, as on the towering Moon rockets, rather than surrounded by booster rockets and a giant fuel tank in the clunky arrangement that prevailed -- and NASA's managers were drinking their own Kool-Aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, I was crossing the parking lot at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., on my way in for the last day of Voyager 2's encounter with Uranus, when a reporter from USA Today came running out and into a phone booth. I asked him about the impending launching of Challenger, with the schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe aboard. ''It blew up,'' he blurted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I went inside to find my colleagues in the press room staring hollow-eyed at television screens. Half of the screens showed Uranus, looking like a big eye surrounded by its tenuous rings; the other half showed the Y-shaped cloud that was all that was left of Challenger and its crew of seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buck Rogers dreams died that day. They died a second death on Feb. 1, 2003, when the Columbia broke apart on re-entry, killing another seven people, after foam insulation had punched a hole in the wing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't catch up with the space shuttle again until 1993, when I watched the astronauts train like underwater ballet dancers in a pool in Huntsville, Ala., to carry out repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope, which had been famously and humiliatingly launched with a misshapen mirror. Late one day, an engineer suggested that Story Musgrave, the lead astronaut on that crew, change his routine and turn around at one point to adjust his torque wrench. Dr. Musgrave dressed him down, saying such last-minute changes put the mission in danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble missions, five in all, were the shuttle's finest hours. In the end, of course, the Hubble did need the shuttle, and its astronauts. It all came to a wonderful high-tech, low-tech climax two years ago, when Michael J. Massimino, channeling his Uncle Frank fixing a car on Long Island, yanked a handrail off the side of the telescope to get at a broken spectrograph underneath it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spectrograph could someday give us a clue to finding another Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble is alone now with the stars, its vision as peerless as designed. But America still has no vision at all for its space program, no plan for where to go next or how.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't blame NASA for that. NASA works for the president, and the president can do only what Congress will give him or her the money for. And Congress answers to the people -- that is to say, its campaign contributors. They've all just been doing what they think they have to do, but an astronomer I know who grew up with the same science fiction dreams and expectations as I did once described himself as a member of the ''cheated generation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I no longer expect to see boot prints on Mars during my lifetime, nor do I expect that whoever eventually makes those boot prints will be drawing a paycheck from NASA, or even speaking English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During shuttle missions, you couldn't wander past the old Saturn 5 rockets sitting outside at the Johnson and Kennedy Space Centers and not wonder in awe what giants had built these rockets that had sent humans all the way to the Moon. I can't help feeling that someday we'll walk past those shuttles now on their way to museums and admire their creature comforts and flexibility and the aerodynamic research that went into learning how to fly at Mach 25. And wonder who built them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish Commander Christopher Ferguson and his comrades a safe and glorious flight aboard their flawed but magnificent chariot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And bigger and braver dreams for us all in the future.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As NASA prepares to launch its last space shuttle -- ending 30 years in which large teams of creative scientists and engineers sent winged spaceships into orbit -- it is facing what may be a bigger challenge: a brain drain that threatens to undermine safety as well as the agency's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space experts say the best and brightest often head for the doors when rocket lines get marked for extinction, dampening morale and creating hidden threats. They call it the ''Team B'' effect.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good guys see the end coming and leave,'' said Albert D. Wheelon, a former aerospace executive and Central Intelligence Agency official. ''You're left with the B students.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA acknowledges the effect and its attendant dangers. It has taken hundreds of steps, including retention bonuses for skilled employees, new perks like travel benefits and more safety drills. Through cuts and attrition in recent years, the shuttle work force has declined to 7,000 workers from about 17,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downsizing has been well managed and has achieved an acceptable level of risk,'' said Joseph W. Dyer, a retired Navy vice admiral and the chairman of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. After a slow start, ''NASA and its industry partners did a genuinely excellent job'' in planning for the shuttle's retirement, he said. But he conceded, ''There's added risk anytime you downsize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody is predicting problems for the coming flight of the Atlantis, the 135th and last launching in the shuttle program. The event is scheduled for Friday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, before an estimated one million spectators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, there is little glory to look forward to. NASA has been forced to cancel the big missions that capture public attention and attract top talent, and frustrations have bubbled to the surface within the agency. Not only has the shuttle program been scrapped, but so has Constellation, which would have sent Americans back to the moon. Astronauts have been steadily leaving the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the direction of the Obama administration and Congress, NASA is instead developing a large new rocket to send deep into space. But no destination has been selected, and money is tight. NASA is also trying to nurture a commercial industry that will loft astronauts toward the stars. But the ventures, which involve partnerships with private-sector companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, focus on hardware development and so far have no declared goals beyond low orbits around the planet. The shuttles did that for decades, starting in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview last week, Charles F. Bolden Jr., NASA's administrator and a former astronaut, said he had no misgivings about the last shuttle flight, and he heaped praise on the agency's work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do we have concerns about morale?'' he asked. ''Yes, we always do. Do we have concerns about the welfare of our workers? Yes, we always do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bolden, a retired Marine Corps general, said his workers were excited not only about the Atlantis mission but also about a range of new endeavors at both the space agency and its commercial partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to help our people stay in the aerospace industry, if not in NASA,'' he said while denying any paralyzing loss of talent. ''We're capturing the brainpower.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he flatly rejected the idea that the agency had lost its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not adrift,'' he said. ''And the vision is not gone. And we have a plan. We have a very sound plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History has offered some bleak lessons, with tons of wreckage testifying to the danger. Experts say the Team B effect contributed to disasters in the mid-1980s and late 1990s that destroyed more than a dozen rockets, wiped out billions of dollars in satellites and threw the nation's unpiloted space program into turmoil. The two catastrophes of the space shuttle program -- in 1986 and 2003, which killed 14 astronauts -- had more to do with design flaws and management failures than with depleted ranks of experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials say close examinations of failures and problematic retirements have made the agency smarter. ''We went out and looked at who has done this well -- and who has not,'' said Bryan D. O'Connor, NASA's chief of safety and mission assurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There could be something we missed,'' he added. ''But I feel pretty confident about the last flight -- it's going to be just as safe as any we've ever had, if not more so, with just as good people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reached a somewhat different conclusion in its annual report. It warned that ''the lack of a defined mission can negatively affect work force morale'' at NASA, and said the agency's own field centers portrayed the loss of big missions as having already ''increased the potential for risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future ambitions might also suffer, the panel warned, because a lack of visionary goals can undermine ''the ability to attract and maintain the necessary skill sets needed for this high-technology venture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the dissatisfaction erupted at the Kennedy Space Center. Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director for the Atlantis, went off-message with colleagues after conducting a safety drill for the coming flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The end of the shuttle program is a tough thing to swallow, and we're all victims of poor policy out of Washington,'' he told his launching team, according to nasaspaceflight.com, a news site. ''I'm embarrassed that we don't have better guidance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the nation's programs for putting astronauts into space ''always had something to transition into'' for half a century. ''Now,'' he added, ''we don't have anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The room erupted in applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bolden, the NASA administrator, was gracious about the episode. Asked about Mr. Leinbach, he offered nothing but praise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. O'Connor, the NASA safety chief, said the agency had taken many steps to ensure that staff reductions did not leave the remaining Atlantis workers feeling overtaxed. For instance, he said, schedules have been stretched out to make sure that the corps of technical experts had sufficient time for troubleshooting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have the bench strength we once had,'' Mr. O'Connor conceded. ''We've got fewer people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dyer, the chairman of Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said the inquiries of his own team suggested that the shuttle work force remained dedicated to doing the best job possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of investigating the darker moments of the shuttle program, he admitted to personal unease about its end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll breathe more easily,'' Mr. Dyer said, ''after the last flight.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the hundreds of thousands of pieces of space-age litter orbiting Earth zipped uncomfortably close to the International Space Station on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six crew members of the space station took refuge in their ''lifeboats'' -- two Soyuz space capsules they would use to escape a crippled station -- as the unidentified object hurtled past them at a speed of 29,000 miles per hour, missing the space station by only 1,100 feet. The episode took place at 8:08 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe the probability that it would the hit the station was about 1 in 360,'' said Lark Howorth, who leads the team at NASA that tracks the space station's trajectory. NASA rules call for precautions when the risk of impact is greater than 1 in 10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the section of the station run by the United States, astronauts closed the hatches in case the debris -- commonly known as space junk -- crashed through, to limit the danger of explosive decompression. To prepare for a rapid departure, the clamps holding the Soyuz capsules to the station were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They would be one command away from releasing the hooks and undocking,'' said Edward Van Cise, NASA's lead flight director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission controllers gave the all-clear signal four minutes later, and the crew members returned to work. There was no sign of damage or impact to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only the second time in the 10-year history of people living on the space station that the crew needed to take such precautions; on March 12, 2009, a piece of an old satellite motor went zipping by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the station had been hit, the crew could have quickly undocked and returned to Earth. The risk of space junk hitting a Soyuz capsule is much slimmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, when NASA gets a warning, several days in advance, that something that might come too close to the station, it moves the station by firing thrusters. Or, if a space shuttle happened to be visiting at the time, the shuttle would nudge the station out of danger. That has happened 12 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, however, the warning came Monday evening, less than 15 hours in advance, too little time to plan a maneuver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched was in 1957, the space neighborhood has become cluttered with human-made detritus -- more than half a million pieces, by recent estimates, from the size of a marble on up. If the orbits of two intersect, the result can be a destructive collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's getting kind of dangerous,'' said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has become an expert on space debris. ''Most active satellites now have a regular process of maneuvering to avoid debris.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA estimates that for each six-month period, there is a 1-in-100 chance that some or all of the space station crew might need to evacuate, and most of that risk comes from the possibility of impact from debris or natural micrometeroids. Over 10 years, the current planned lifetime of the station, the cumulative risk is nearly one in five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's at the level where it probably won't happen in the lifetime of the station, but it could easily,'' Dr. McDowell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debris includes spent rocket stages, and sometimes over time residual fuel combines and explodes. ''You now no longer have a rocket stage,'' Dr. McDowell said. ''You have 500 pieces of shrapnel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also still in orbit are broken satellites or almost incidental litter. In the past, lens covers on satellite cameras and sensors were simply popped off and left to float away. Now satellite makers put the lens cap on a hinge.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN March 1969, Charles M. Schulz created six sequential ''Peanuts'' cartoon strips following the pensive beagle Snoopy on a journey to the moon and back. They not only reflected America's anticipation of Apollo 11 -- the first manned lunar landing, which would take place in July of that year -- but also drew on the relationship between NASA and the ''Peanuts'' gang. That connection is the subject of ''To the Moon: Snoopy Soars With NASA,'' now on view at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition made its debut in 2009 at the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, Calif., to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 10 mission, which took place in May 1969 as a dress rehearsal for Apollo 11. The Apollo 10 crew had chosen ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'' as the respective call names for their command and lunar modules. While the astronaut John W. Young orbited the moon in ''Charlie Brown,'' Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan piloted ''Snoopy'' within 50,000 feet of the moon's surface to scout a landing area for Apollo 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To the Moon,'' organized by Jane O'Cain, the curator of the Schulz Museum, examines the Apollo 10 mission through a ''beagle-has-landed'' lens and addresses Snoopy's role as NASA's safety mascot since 1968. Among the artifacts on display are a reproduction of Mr. Schulz's earliest sketch of Snoopy as an astronaut and a two-by-three-inch segment of Apollo 10's Mylar coating retrieved at splashdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An audio-visual presentation features footage of Earth and the moon's surface taken during the flight (Apollo 10 was the first mission to provide live color telecasts from space) and video clips of the crew reminiscing about the mission. A case of memorabilia contains ''Astronaut Snoopy'' merchandise from the period, including dolls, a piggy bank, and ceramic salt and pepper shakers. A children's area features dress-up astronaut suits and, for a space-themed photo op, a model of an Apollo 10 astronaut with an opening for a child's face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As safety mascot, Snoopy, his head engulfed in a space helmet, appears on numerous NASA posters and on the highly prized Silver Snoopy lapel pins, which are flown into space during missions and then awarded by NASA's astronaut office to those who have contributed to the human space flight program. Visitors to ''To the Moon'' will find a Silver Snoopy and a selection of posters. In one, signed by Mr. Schulz, Snoopy poses alongside three astronauts. Its message reads, ''Wherever they go... He goes!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of ''To the Moon'' is from the Schulz Museum's traveling exhibition, the Stamford Museum, which has an observatory on its grounds, has added several pieces from its own collections. There are models of a lunar landing module and a Saturn rocket, both produced by NASA in the 1960s, and a moon camera used before the Apollo missions. Also on display is a print of a partial eclipse by Etienne Leopold Trouvelot, a 19th-century French artist and astronomer whose work was exhibited at the Stamford Museum in May. And in conjunction with ''To the Moon,'' the museum's ''Astronomy Nights'' series will include ''History of the Apollo Program,'' a lecture by Robert Morrow, a science teacher at Fairfield Warde High School in Fairfield, followed by an opportunity (weather permitting) to see the night sky through the observatory's 22-inch telescope. The lecture is scheduled for July 8, the target date for the launch of the space shuttleAtlantis on its final flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosa Portell, the curator of collections at the Stamford Museum, recalled watching the Apollo missions as a child and the enthusiasm they generated. For her, the winding down of NASA's space shuttle program intensifies the memories evoked by the exhibit. ''As the program is approaching its end,'' Ms. Portell said, ''suddenly everyone seems very nostalgic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To the Moon: Snoopy Soars With NASA'' runs through Aug. 21 in the Bendel Mansion Museum Galleries at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 39 Scofieldtown Road, Stamford. ''Astronomy Nights: History of the Apollo Program,'' recommended for ages 5 and up, is at 7:30 p.m. on July 8; $3, $2 for ages 5 to 17. For more information: stamfordmuseum.org or (203) 322-1646.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LATELY, the Sun has been behaving a bit strangely. In 2008 and 2009, it showed the least surface activity in nearly a century. Solar flare activity stopped cold and weeks and months went by without any sunspots, or areas of intense magnetism. Quiet spells are normal for the Sun, but researchers alive today had never seen anything like that two-year hibernation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the Sun is approaching the peak of its magnetic cycle, when solar storms -- blasts of electrically charged magnetic clouds -- are most likely to occur, no one can predict how it will behave. Will solar activity continue to be sluggish, or will solar storms rage with renewed vigor?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, policy makers are paying attention to space weather. Late last month, President Obama and the British prime minister David Cameron announced that the United States and Britain will work together to create ''a fully operational global space weather warning system.'' And just last week, the United Nations pledged to upgrade its space weather forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most people have never heard of space weather, which is a problem, because both high and low solar activity have serious effects on life on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern society depends on a variety of technologies that are susceptible to the extremes of space weather. Spectacular explosions on the Sun's surface produce solar storms of intense magnetism and radiation. These events can disrupt the operation of power grids, railway signaling, magnetic surveying and drilling for oil and gas. Magnetic storms also heat the upper atmosphere, changing its density and composition and disrupting radio communications and GPS units. The storms' charged particles can be a hazard to the health of astronauts and passengers on high altitude flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severe storms in 1989 and 2003 caused blackouts in Canada and Sweden. In 1859, a solar super storm sparked fires in telegraph offices. Such storms are predicted every century or so, and perhaps we're overdue. According to a 2008 National Academies report, a once-in-a-century solar storm could cause the financial damage of 20 Hurricane Katrinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quiet Sun causes its own problems. During the two-year quiet spell, our upper atmosphere, normally heated and inflated by the Sun's extreme ultraviolet radiation, cooled off and shrank. This altered the propagation of GPS signals and slowed the rate of decay of space debris in low Earth orbit. In addition, the cosmic rays that are normally pushed out to the fringes of the solar system by solar explosions instead surged around Earth, threatening astronauts and satellites with unusually high levels of radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more we know about solar activity, the better we can protect ourselves. The Sun is surrounded by a fleet of spacecraft that can see sunspots forming, flares crackling and a solar storm about 30 minutes before it hits Earth. NASA and the National Science Foundation have also developed sophisticated models to predict where solar storms will go once they leave the Sun, akin to National Weather Service programs that track hurricanes and tornadoes on Earth. Thanks to these sentries, it is increasingly difficult for the Sun to take us by surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If alerted, Internet server hubs, telecommunications centers and financial institutions can prepare for disruptions and power plant operators can disconnect transformers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what good are space weather alerts if people don't understand them and won't react to them? Consider the following: If anyone should be familiar with the risks of space weather, it's a pilot. During solar storms, transpolar flights are routinely diverted because the storms can disrupt the planes' communications equipment. And yet a space weather forecaster we know at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration often tells a story of a conversation he had with a pilot:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pilot: ''What do you do for a living?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecaster: ''I forecast space weather.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pilot: ''Really? What's that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point of the story is to highlight how far the scientific community and the government have to go to raise awareness about space weather and its effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the sun waking up, trans-Atlantic cooperation comes at just the right time. Let us hope it is only the beginning of a worldwide effort to forecast and understand space weather.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, many planetary scientists did not express much curiosity about Mercury, which looked gray and cratered -- a slightly larger version of the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But data released Thursday from NASA's Mercury Messenger spacecraft, which entered orbit around Mercury in March, is painting a more vibrant picture of the solar system's innermost planet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mercury ain't the Moon,'' Ralph L. McNutt Jr., the mission's project scientist, said at a NASA news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new findings: Some of Mercury's topography is not seen anywhere else in the solar system -- rimless pits, for instance -- and its mineralogy is vastly different from the Moon's, whose rocks have much less potassium. Scientists already knew that Mercury has a magnetic field, while the Moon does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest batch of data includes the clearest pictures yet of Mercury's polar regions, plus readings of the elements in its crust, which have helped scientists rule out some theories about the planet's origins. Mercury Messenger has also discovered that the planet's magnetic field is stronger in its northern hemisphere than in its southern, which hints at something odd in the structure of its molten core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new information could reveal how Mercury formed and changed over the 4.5-billion-year history of the solar system, which in turn could help astronomers understand the panoply of Earth-size planets around other stars and the possibility of conditions friendly for life on them. NASA's Kepler telescope has discovered dozens of possible Earth-size planets, but its observations can determine little beyond their size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have in our solar system four experiments in how four Earthlike planets evolve once they form under slightly different conditions,'' said Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator for Mercury Messenger, referring to Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, the four rocky planets of the inner solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're learning is that each of those experiments had an extraordinarily different outcome,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''And one of those experiments we live on. So it really behooves us, in a very general way, to understand how Earthlike planets form and evolve and operate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the mysteries is why the iron core of Mercury is unusually large, extending out three-quarters of the way to the surface. Earth's core, by contrast, extends a little more than halfway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea was that Mercury was originally larger, and the young Sun was so intense that the radiation stripped away the outer layers, leaving behind the Mercury seen today. But that theory predicted low abundances of certain elements like potassium that would have easily evaporated in the intense heat. Mercury Messenger measured ample amounts of potassium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can rule out this kind of model,'' said Larry R. Nittler, a staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and a member of the science team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another theory is that Mercury formed out of metal-rich meteorites. By and large, the observed composition of the surface rocks does not fit with that theory either, although a variation could still prove the correct explanation, Dr. Nittler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third idea is that a giant impact early in Mercury's history knocked off a large fraction of the planet. ''This is the model that is still in the running,'' Dr. Nittler said. ''There are probably going to be many more models devised before we have an answer on this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-resolution images of craters revealed irregular pits, ranging in width from several hundred feet to a few miles. The pits do not have rims like craters produced by impacts, leading the scientists to speculate that they were etched by some unstable material that evaporated quickly when exposed at the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury Messenger's one-year mission around the planet is only one-quarter done, so more information about the planet will be forthcoming. Already, Dr. Solomon said, the orbiter has dispelled the misconception that Mercury is a boring place, and that what NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft saw in 1974 and 1975 during three flybys was all that was to be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some even in the planetary community, after the Mariner 10 mission, placed a low priority on returning a spacecraft to Mercury on the grounds that it was very much like the Moon, we'd been to the Moon,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''It was an example, to use a phrase coined by a very famous space scientist, of 'one of the burnt-out cinders of the solar system.' And it is anything but that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second time that an Iranian rocket had carried a satellite into orbit and took place more than two years after Iran joined the international space club by launching its first satellite.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran released few details about the satellite, which it calls Rasad-1, or Observation-1. Western experts said it weighed about 100 pounds -- meaning that the light payload and the modest rocket carrying it bore little resemblance to an intercontinental missile and its heavy warhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, aerospace experts said the successful launching demonstrated Iranian engineers' growing skill and contrasted with the repeated failures endured by North Korea in trying to place payloads into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a significant step forward for the Iranians,'' said Charles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at GlobalSecurity.org, a private research group in Alexandria, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it did not come as a surprise to those who monitor Iran's efforts. ''Everybody's been expecting this,'' said Marcia S. Smith, founder of SpacePolicyOnline.com, a news blog in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vick noted that the Iranians had announced that Rasad-1 would be lofted last summer, but the mission then was delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's taken them far longer than they advertised,'' Mr. Vick said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason, he added, appeared to be managerial failures and ''sanctions that have been having a significant impact on their getting foreign technology and hardware.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the Iranian satellite as an experimental craft designed mainly for tracking the Earth's resources from space. But the spacecraft, he said, ''could also be used for low-resolution reconnaissance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian news reports said that the Rasad-1 was built by the Malek-Ashtar University. Analysts in the American intelligence community view the university as having close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, the Islamic Republic's main enforcers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian scientists have long hailed the benefits of Earth-observation satellites for tracking floods, fighting fires, gauging earthquake damage, finding evacuation routes and identifying high-risk areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced plans to launch several Iranian-built satellites this year, including at least one for reconnaissance. He also repeated a claim that Tehran would send an Iranian astronaut into space by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran placed its first satellite into orbit in February 2009. The nation's 5,000 rial banknote, the equivalent of 50 cents, bears the satellite's image. The Iranians called it a rudimentary communications craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the launching on Wednesday came on the country's Arabic-language television channel, Al-Alam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The channel said a rocket known as Safir, or messenger, fired the satellite into an orbit with a maximum height of 162 miles. ''It is capable of photographing the Earth,'' the report said of the satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The channel said Rasad-1 would circle the Earth 15 times a day and should operate for two months. Iranian media reports have said the Safir rocket can carry a satellite weighing 110 pounds into elliptical orbits as high as 280 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western nations fear that Iran is trying to develop a missile capability under cover of its space program that could also threaten to deliver nuclear warheads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran denies that it has any ambition to develop an atom bomb and asserts that both its space and nuclear programs are peaceful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is openly developing a group of increasingly large rockets. In theory, the biggest might eventually be powerful enough to hurl not only satellites into space, but also warheads between continents.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the agency gets its space shuttles ready to be shipped out to museums, it will not be sending them off lock, stock and barrel. The crews doing the prep work have been flooded with requests to squirrel away parts of the spacecraft for analysis. Valves, flight-control instruments, even the tires and windows -- little is safe from the clutches of NASA engineers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got a list of hundreds of items that have to come off the ship,'' said Stephanie S. Stilson, who is directing the preparation of the shuttle Discovery for delivery to the Smithsonian Institution next year in what NASA calls its ''transition and retirement'' program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, NASA named the permanent old-age homes for its shuttles, which have been escorting astronauts to space for 30 years. The Endeavour, which completed its last mission early Wednesday with a pinpoint landing after 16 days in orbit, will bask in glory only briefly before it is groomed for delivery to the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The Atlantis, which will make its final flight next month, is destined to live at the visitors' center here at the space center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery made its last flight in March and now sits in a maintenance bay, enclosed by platforms that would normally be crawling with workers inspecting and maintaining its many systems -- including the thousands of thermal tiles that cover its skin -- to be ready for its next liftoff. These days, as the shuttle program winds down and the staff has been winnowed by layoffs, technicians work on the Discovery only when there are no more pressing tasks. And rather than sprucing it up for another trip to space, likely as not they are taking something out of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We in engineering, we want to hold on to things that we could potentially use, or we want to study them, which is a smart thing to do,'' Ms. Stilson said. The shuttles are the only spacecraft that have been launched into orbit multiple times -- the Discovery is the most-traveled, with 39 missions -- and a better understanding of how the materials and equipment have fared could help future aerospace designers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stilson spoke near one of the Discovery's main landing gears, where the tires used on the last flight had been removed in favor of what NASA calls ''roll-around tires'' -- basically a bunch of old spares. On a higher platform, workers were putting the finishing touches on replacement windows for the spacecraft, the originals having been taken out so engineers could study what effect the microdebris encountered in so many trips in space had on the glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those who are to receive the shuttles say they understand the need for research, they are a little surprised by how much will be missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're considered to be the nation's official repository of our past,'' said Valerie Neal, curator for contemporary human spaceflight at the Smithsonian, which will display the Discovery at the National Air and Space Museum's annex near Dulles Airport. ''Our point of view would be to receive an orbiter in as intact a state as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neal said that when she first started discussing the fate of the shuttle with NASA several years ago, ''I rather naively thought it would be intact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the removal work is dictated by safety concerns. There are small explosive charges all around the shuttle, including one designed to blow a latch and deploy the front landing gear should the normal systems fail. Although the firing mechanism has been disabled, ''We don't want to take a chance that if it's sitting in the Smithsonian it could somehow detonate,'' Ms. Stilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thrusters near the shuttle's nose and the podlike maneuvering engines in the rear both contain propellants that are highly toxic and corrosive, even in tiny amounts. So these components have been removed and sent to a special facility where workers in hazardous materials suits will ''cut and gut'' them, removing much of the insides before shipping them back. ''We'll reinstall them, and from the outside they'll look exactly the same,'' Ms. Stilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's three main engines have been removed, in part because NASA has hopes they might be used again. In their place crews will install spare nozzles, the bell-shaped parts that the public sees protruding from the back of the spacecraft. But all the exquisitely machined pumps and plumbing that once handled thousands of gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen will essentially be replaced by an empty box. NASA, with its penchant for abbreviations, even has one for these: R.S.M.E.'s, for replica shuttle main engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Quinn, a technician who works for a NASA contractor and has cared for shuttles for 23 years, said it was ''a little bittersweet'' taking out the engines for the last time, which took about two weeks. But he is still proud that the Discovery will be on display. ''Basically, it will be in flight configuration as far as we're concerned, except that it will be a simulated engine,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not that NASA engineers are hovering over the shuttles like mechanics at a junkyard, trying to abscond with whatever they can get their hands on. The agency has a formal vetting process for part requests, and the proposals have to include bona fide research projects. ''I think that they're trying to install some checks and balances so the vehicles don't get totally cannibalized,'' Ms. Neal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey N. Rudolph, president of the California Science Center, said his organization also had some concerns, but would ''try to turn it into a positive.'' For example, he said, if NASA wants to reuse the main engines, ''that's a story we can tell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neal, who said she had ''come to peace'' that the toxic elements had to be removed but was ''heartbroken'' to learn that the main engines were going as well, said the Smithsonian had asked NASA to document everything it was taking out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I appreciate the engineering needs,'' she said, adding that there was a ''perfectly reasonable rationale'' for removing many parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she noted that in the past NASA engineers had come to the Smithsonian to get inside the Apollo command module displayed there, to get a firsthand feel for the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm thinking ahead 25, 50, 100 years,'' she said. ''I'm convinced there will be a need to get back inside the shuttle. People are going to want to know -- how did they do it? That's why we need to keep it as intact as possible.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IRVINE, Calif. -- Scientists have been using small variations in the Earth's gravity to identify trouble spots around the globe where people are making unsustainable demands on groundwater, one of the planet's main sources of fresh water.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found problems in places as disparate as North Africa, northern India, northeastern China and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley in California, heartland of that state's $30 billion agricultural industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay S. Famiglietti, director of the University of California's Center for Hydrologic Modeling here, said the center's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as Grace, relies on the interplay of two nine-year-old twin satellites that monitor each other while orbiting the Earth, thereby producing some of the most precise data ever on the planet's gravitational variations. The results are redefining the field of hydrology, which itself has grown more critical as climate change and population growth draw down the world's fresh water supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace sees ''all of the change in ice, all of the change in snow and water storage, all of the surface water, all of the soil moisture, all of the groundwater,'' Dr. Famiglietti explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even as the data signal looming shortages, policy makers have been relatively wary of embracing the findings. California water managers, for example, have been somewhat skeptical of a recent finding by Dr. Famiglietti that from October 2003 to March 2010, aquifers under the state's Central Valley were drawn down by 25 million acre-feet -- almost enough to fill Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Zlotnick, a board member of the Association of California Water Agencies, said that the managers feared that the data could be marshaled to someone else's advantage in California's tug of war over scarce water supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of paranoia about policy wonks saying, 'We've got to regulate the heck out of you,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other sensitivities in arid regions around the world where groundwater basins are often shared by unfriendly neighbors -- India and Pakistan, Tunisia and Libya or Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories -- that are prone to suspecting one another of excessive use of this shared resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water politics was hardly on Dr. Famiglietti's mind when he first heard about Grace. In 1992, applying for a job at the University of Texas, he was interviewed by Clark R. Wilson, a geophysicist there who described a planned experiment to measure variations in Earth's gravitational field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I walked into his office and he pulled out a piece of paper saying: I'm trying to figure out how distribution of water makes the Earth wobble,'' said Dr. Famiglietti. ''This was 1992. I was blown away. I instantly fell in love with the guy. I said, 'This is unbelievable, this is amazing, it opens up this whole area.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then the Grace experiment was still waiting in a queue of NASA projects. But he and Matt Rodell, a Ph.D. candidate under his supervision, threw themselves into investigating whether Grace would work, a so-called ''proof of concept'' exercise which turned out to show that Grace data were reliable and could support groundwater studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a wide-open field we came into,'' said Dr. Rodell, now a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ''We were like kids in a candy store. There was so much to be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Grace was conceived by a group of scientists led by Byron D. Tapley, the director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas, it was the darling of geodesists, who study variations in the Earth's size, shape and rotational axis. Climate scientists also were keenly interested in using it to study melting of ice sheets, but hydrologists paid scant attention at first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Dr. Wilson recalled, ''Jay jumped on the problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years later, the two satellites were launched from the Russian space facility at Plesetsk on the back of a used intercontinental ballistic missile in a collaboration between NASA and the German Aerospace Center and began streaming the gravity data back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acquiring the data for general research purposes would have been impossible before the end of the cold war because maps indicating the normal wiggles in Earth's gravitational field were used for targeting long-range missiles and were therefore classified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, groundwater measurements in the United States had been made from points on the Earth's surface -- by taking real-time soundings at 1,383 of the United States Geological Survey's observation wells and daily readings at 5,908 others. Those readings are supplemented by measuring water levels in hundreds of thousands of other wells, trenches and excavations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two satellites, each the size of a small car, travel in polar orbits about 135 miles apart. Each bombards the other with microwaves calibrating the distance between them down to intervals of less than the width of a human hair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mass below the path of the leading satellite increases -- because, say, the lower Mississippi basin is waterlogged -- that satellite speeds up, and the distance between the two grows. Then the mass tugs on both, and the distance shortens. It increases again as the forward satellite moves out of range while the trailing satellite is held back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measurements of the distance between the craft translate to a measurement of surface mass in any given region. The data is beautifully simple, Dr. Famiglietti said. From one moment to the next, ''it gives you just one number,'' he said. ''It's like getting on a scale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separating groundwater from other kinds of moisture affecting gravity requires a little calculation and the inclusion of information on precipitation and surface runoff obtained from surface studies or computer models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace data, like the information in a corresponding visual image, has its limits. Gravitational data gets sparser as the area examined gets smaller, and in areas smaller than 75,000 square miles it gets more difficult to reach conclusions about groundwater supplies. Most aquifers are far smaller than that -- California's 22,000-square-mile Central Valley overlies several different groundwater basins, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Famiglietti was able to calculate the overall drawdown of groundwater and to indicate that the problem was most severe in the southern region around the city of Tulare, for example, but the data was far too sparse to make statements about, say, the Kings River Water Conservation District, which measures about 1,875 square miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace ''gives a large picture,'' said Felix Landerer, a hydrologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, whereas a water manager has a couple of wells to monitor in a given district. ''It's difficult and not intuitive and not straightforward to bring these things together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas of the world, like northern India, the novelty of the gravitational measurements -- and perhaps the story they tell -- has led to pushback, scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is odd, if you're a hydrologist, especially a traditional hydrologist, to imagine a satellite up in the air that determines groundwater'' supply levels, said John Wahr, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Dr. Famiglietti and Dr. Rodell, Dr. Wahr and his colleague Sean Swenson faced opposition for a study on aquifer depletion in northern India. As Dr. Swenson explained, ''When in a place like India you say, 'We're doing something that is unsustainable and needs to change,' well, people resist change. Change is expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Dr. Famiglietti says he wants no part of water politics, he acknowledged that this might be hard to avoid, given that his role is to make sure the best data about groundwater is available, harvesting and disseminating all of the information he can about the Earth's water supply as aquifers dry up and shortages loom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look, water has been a resource that has been plentiful,'' he said. ''But now we've got climate change, we've got population growth, we've got widespread groundwater contamination, we've got satellites showing us we are depleting some of this stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we've taken it for granted, and we are probably not able to do that any more.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not raining on the Moon, but it does seem to be getting wetter and wetter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the prevailing view of the Moon was that it was dry. Then, two years ago, a NASA probe crashed into a deep crater near the Moon's south pole and confirmed large amounts of water ice within the shadows. Meanwhile, measurements by an orbiting Indian spacecraft suggested that a veneer of water, generated by the bombardment of solar wind particles, covered much of the Moon's surface.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, scientists analyzing tiny fragments of hardened lava from long-ago lunar eruptions report that the fragments contain about as much water as similar magmas on Earth, meaning there is plenty of water inside the Moon too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have to admit, we were a little surprised,'' said Erik H. Hauri, a staff scientist in geochemistry at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and lead author of a paper published Thursday in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hauri's surprise comes despite the fact that he and several of his co-authors predicted three years ago that they would find that much water. Back then, they looked at tiny beads of volcanic glass -- the beads were about the size of periods in printed text -- in soil brought back by Apollo astronauts. The beads contained water, but not a lot a lot of it: a maximum of 46 parts per million -- or 0.0046 percent water. Their models suggested that 95 percent of the water originally in the hot magma escaped as it cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hauri acknowledged that the extrapolation was less than ironclad. ''That's sticking your neck out pretty far,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new work started when another member of the research team, Alberto E. Saal, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University, handed a vial of Moon dirt to Thomas Weinreich, a Brown freshman, and asked him to sift through it for interesting particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Weinreich laboriously examined the soil, grain by grain, under a microscope, he found, mixed among the glass beads, some clear crystals; some of those crystals contained a tiny amount of glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crystals, made of the mineral olivine, prevented any of the water in the enclosed glass from escaping. The amount of water in the trapped glass was 20 to 100 times what had been previously measured in the glass beads, comparable to the water content of some Earth magmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a reservoir down there in the Moon that has the same concentration of water as some reservoirs in the upper mantle of Earth,'' Dr. Saal said. ''That's for sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is much less certain is how large the underground water-rich reservoir might be. Last year, researchers led by Zachary D. Sharp of the University of New Mexico came to the exact opposite conclusion. Based on concentrations of chlorine isotopes in lunar rocks, they concluded that the rocks must have hardened out of lava that contained almost no water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the interior of the Moon turns out to contain considerable water, then the ice at the bottom of lunar craters may have come from volcanic eruptions rather than comet impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finding would also throw a new wrinkle into explanations of how the Moon formed in the aftermath of a collision between the Earth and a Mars-size interloper about 4.6 billion years ago. The cataclysm would have created a ring of debris at an intensely hot temperature -- in the thousands of degrees. And the expectation of many scientists is that any water would have escaped into space before the debris coalesced into a dry moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's frankly a confusing picture,'' said David J. Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology. The giant impact theory provides a satisfying explanation for the orbit, size and basic physical characteristics of the Moon. But scientists have not been able to fully explain what makes up the Moon, and the water finding potentially adds another mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you will find among geochemists, cosmic chemists, there's still some doubt there,'' Dr. Stevenson said. ''They say, 'That's a wonderful story, but how does it fit my data?' ''</p>

On the 17th, a force of anti-Castro exiles, trained by the C.I.A., invaded communist Cuba at the Bay of Pigs -- a fiasco within 36 hours.

You got the president into this. We've got to do something to show the Russians we are not paper tigers.'' At another, the president pleaded: ''If somebody can, just tell me how to catch up. Let's find somebody -- anybody. I don't care if it's the janitor over there.'' Heading back to the Oval Office, he told Mr. Sorensen, ''There's nothing more important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, 50 years ago, on May 25, 1961, President Kennedy addressed a joint session of Congress and a national television audience, declaring: ''I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There it was, the challenge flung before an adversary and to a nation on edge in an unconventional war, the beginning of Project Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Echoes of this time lift off the pages of ''John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon'' (Palgrave Macmillan), a new book by John M. Logsdon, a political scientist and longtime space policy specialist at George Washington University. He has drawn on new research in archives, oral histories and memoirs available in recent years to shed new light on the moon race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The famous speech came after five weeks of hand wringing, back-channel memos and closed-door conferences, often overseen by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. In those meetings NASA and Pentagon officials, scientists and engineers, budget analysts and others decided that sending astronauts to the Moon by the end of the sixties was the country's best shot at overcoming the Soviet post-Sputnik command of the orbital front in the cold war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Dr. Logsdon said in an interview last week, the new material highlighted some recurring themes that had been overlooked, like Mr. Kennedy's return, time and again, to the idea of engaging the Russians in a cooperative venture, his continuing support of the project through a time of doubt, and how little was known then of Soviet capabilities and intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, Dr. Logsdon said, hindsight had made him aware of his blindness to Apollo's implications for the long run. He said he had been wrong, in a 1970 book on the subject, to think that the lunar decision ''can be generalized to tell us how to proceed toward other ''great new American enterprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like many others who for years lived and breathed the project, he finally had to recognize that the ''impact of Apollo on the space program has on balance been negative.'' It was, he explained, not the beginning of human voyages to Mars and lunar bases but ''a dead-end undertaking in terms of human travel beyond the immediate vicinity of this planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it takes two to have a race. The American president could not be sure the Russians had a lunar-landing program. There was no evidence that the Russians were building facilities for a booster capable of launching people to the Moon. Was the president just double-dog-daring them to come out in the schoolyard and show their stuff?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An intelligence report in 1962 had nothing to add, short of speculating that ''the chances are better than even that a lunar landing is a Soviet objective.'' Only in 1964 did intelligence agents detect signs that there was indeed someone to make it a race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, NASA set its sights on late 1967 for the landing attempt. As spending escalated, Apollo ran into its first sharp criticism in Congress, the science establishment and the news media in 1963. ''Even some of the Kennedy advisers were eager to slip the end-of-decade date and relieve the pressure, mainly to save money,'' Dr. Logsdon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ''winds of change,'' as he put it, may have motivated Kennedy's renewed invitation in a United Nations address in September to the Russians to join in a cooperative mission. He had proposed this informally to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, at a meeting in Vienna shortly after his 1961 address to Congress. It was rejected out of hand. Russian accounts after the cold war have linked the rejection to a fear of exposing the technological shortcomings of the country's program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter A. McDougall, the historian who wrote ''The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age,'' has suggested that Kennedy's periodic messages on space cooperation ''were just exercises in image-building.'' Dr. McDougall took a more skeptical view of spaceflight's bearing on geopolitics, more in line with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address on the spreading influence of the military-industrial complex in national affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon countered that the American achievements had by 1963 progressed to the point, as Mr. Sorensen said, that there was ''a very real chance that we were even with the Soviets.'' And since the Cuban missile crisis the year before, it was noted, Soviet-American relations had improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser, talked tactics with the president. Either press for cooperation with the Russians, he suggested, or continue to use their space effort as ''a spur to our own.'' In a memorandum, Mr. Bundy said that ''if we cooperate, the pressure comes off'' regarding the decade goal, and ''we can easily argue that it was our crash effort in '61 and '62 which made the Soviets ready to cooperate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year of criticism, Kennedy wavered but never backed away from his lunar commitment. Visiting Cape Canaveral on Nov. 16, 1963, he seemed to enjoy seeing preparations for the next astronaut flights. Days later, on Nov. 22, in the speech Kennedy never lived to give in Dallas, he intended to say ''the United States of America has no intention of finishing second in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal was reached on July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong and then Buzz Aldrin stepped on the gray surface of the Sea of Tranquillity. Since the last of six landings, in 1972, no one has been back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No presidents since have felt the need or believed they could marshal political support for comparable undertakings. NASA has achieved dazzling successes exploring the solar system and the cosmos with robotic craft. But the agency was driven at the outset by the challenge of human flight to the Moon. At the conclusion of Apollo, Dr. Logsdon wrote, ''NASA entered a four-decade identity crisis from which it has yet to emerge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the book and interview, Dr. Logsdon sought solace in thinking that flying to the Moon at least ''will forever be a milestone in human experience, and particularly in the history of human exploration, perhaps eventual expansion.'' Even critics like Dr. McDougall conceded that ''perhaps Apollo could not be justified, but by God, we could not not do it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What might Guy Laliberte do next? He was a stilt walker and fire eater in Montreal before founding <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span> in 1984. He later became a world-class competitive poker player, and in 2009 he rocketed into space as one of the first astrotourists. A study in teleology as much as topography, ''Gaia'' (Assouline, $65) is his space scrapbook, filled with digital photos that zoom in on dramatically abstract 300-square-mile swaths of Earth. ''Day after day, I was amazed by the beauty of this planet,'' he said. ''It is an infinite living art in motion.'' The full text of T's exclusive interview with Laliberte is after the jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I wanted to start by asking you about the title page. You say the book is ''curated'' by you? Why did you choose that phrasing when you actually went into space and took these photographs yourself?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.I took the photographs, but I didn't want to position myself as a photographer. Most of the photo books are usually done by professional photographers. And I really have no pretension of that. The notion of ''curated'' is really because, if you look in the book, it's not only pictures, there's also the content - a lot of text, poems from great writers, people bigger than I am. The notion of curated was to put together something that will touch people, not only the picture but also text that has very fundamental value to humanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet you've managed to get some extraordinary photographs and you've gone to great lengths to get them. How were these pictures physically taken?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had access there to a series of equipment - basically <span class="companylink">Nikon</span> D3, D3X with different types of lenses. And I did learn on Earth a little bit how those cameras work because I'm old fashioned - I'm an old dinosaur. I was still shooting with my old 35mm camera that I had for 30 years. This is new technology for me, and I'm not a technical guy at all. So while I was training, I got a couple of classes to understand how that electronic camera works. The first day [in space] was about how to take a picture. And then you realize that you're flying at 18,000 kilometers an hour and your subject goes under your eyes pretty fast. It's a constant amazing scenic vision. You basically have to use one eye on your left, seeing things coming. And then starting the motion of framing your subject, adjusting your lens, and once you're just at the right moment to frame it, you have to click. And once you click, you're done. That's it. It passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell me the difference about the photographs you took and what you could see with the naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know if you can remember - you probably have done this when you were a kid - when those clouds come up and you lay down on the grass and watch the clouds just get in motion. And then you start to envision, to see characters, animal shapes and stuff like that. I did that myself many times as a kid. Basically, when I was there, I lived the reverse. After the first days, after I kind of practiced shooting, it was exactly this feeling. There have been so many pictures done by astronauts and cosmonauts, which are more scientific or just traditional, cliche. And I want to try to make it distinctive with a little artistic twist in it. This is what I was looking for: animal shapes, characters, organic forms, geometrical things, and, of course, the beauty of the planet by itself. Volcanoes - there are some subjects you cannot pass through without taking them. I was seeing big cities, but those subjects were not really interesting me. I was looking for other things. Because those cities have been photographed many times before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're not tremendously magnified, these images?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All my lenses were between basically 200 to 800 millimeters, so I had a quite good zoom. But all the pictures are basically natural. But you take the photographs through the window, and, of course from the stratosphere, there was a kind of a milky thing to it. Which we cleaned up a bit. But basically the photos were pretty much just what I was seeing. What is in the book is exactly the frame I took, we didn't cut any frame or readjust anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you went up there you didn't know that you were going to be so compelled by taking pictures?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, the pictures I was foreseeing taking more as souvenirs. I've been traveling all my life, and always I take pictures every place I go. And it's more personal. And when I got back I started sharing it with friends and I was seeing their reaction. A couple of photographer friends, I showed them and they said, ''Listen, you have something.'' One of the things that stunned people was my framing. I guess it comes from my profession - working at <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span>, I'm a perfectionist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which do you find more rewarding, the images that tend more toward abstraction because the scale isn't obvious, or the ones where you realize how big it is because there are buildings and bridges and things like that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My favorite ones have an organic feeling to them. And the characters ones. I really amused myself picking out animal shapes and character shapes. This was my little pleasure session. I knew that no other astronaut or cosmonaut was having that look at the Earth. When they take pictures up there, most are because they have targets to reach for scientific reasons. The only thing I regret is that I wasn't able to take two months there because there's really a limited time - nine days in the station -- that you cover the Earth. It theoretically takes a month and a half to cover all continents. But that doesn't consider the clouds. And earth is covered in clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think space tourism is a good thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a privilege to go there. There's a universe out there. And I wish to everybody to be able to live that experience - to be able to see this planet from another point of view. When I was up there, there was some very specific moment when I was looking at the Earth in perspective of the universe. And it's an amazing void down there. You see the stars as far as you look. It's dark pitch. They're discovering life out there - we're probably not the only planet to have life - but so far we haven't encountered any of that. And you look at Earth and you see it in the perspective of the universe and you see it's fragility, how it preserved life from that little thin membrane that surrounded. And you say, ''Wow, it's so fragile.'' And then you start to look at Earth in perspective of the human race as species. And then you look at volcanoes - when you are up there you see volcano eruptions, and hurricanes, and you even see big waves. So you see it's power. And you see that this planet has been there for millions of years, and wiped out many species. And start to realize, wait a minute, we are the ones who are a fragile situation, not the planet. The planet will adapt to anything. Maybe we should start to use the heart and the brain that we've been given to organize ourselves. Because if we keep screwing up things we may be just passing by in the history of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interesting. So going into space made you appreciate the fragility of humankind more so than the Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was a believer before. A lot of people asked, did it change you? It didn't change me. These are the values that I always had, thanks to my parents and the people I met through my life, the people that inspire me. But yes, this is something that reaffirms those beliefs. This is why I wish that more people would be able to do it. Because you know I was the No. 5 [space tourist] to go in space. We're still at the exploration part of it. Those guys who are living out there, they're really the explorers of the modern time. And they're so far away from being able to go further into space for many reasons - cost reasons, physical reasons . Adaption of the human body in space is not yet mastered. As soon as you hit space, you feel your body is going through a period of mutation. There's no blood in your head, you have a hard time swallowing. We're not born to naturally be in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know in addition to <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span>, you've become a professional poker player, you've gone into space, now there's a book of photographs. What is going to be the next big project?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book is the result of my next commitment, which is my foundation, One Drop. I'm a humanist. I always believed, even with Cirque du Soliel, that this is my way to contribute to a better world. I believe I'm very privileged, but many people face the reality when they wake up in the morning of not having food or a glass of water. Life's been good to me, and I believe you have to feed the circle of life. All my royalties will go to the foundation. The book is being done to raise money, to do projects, to bring water to people who need it, and to save life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNT HOPKINS, Ariz. -- There is no Border Patrol in space. But the very earthly cat-and-mouse game between smugglers and America's border agents is affecting the exploration of space, lighting up the nighttime sky in southern Arizona and making astronomers strain even harder to figure out the mysteries of the universe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona is an astronomy haven with an array of prestigious observatories taking advantage of the state's dry weather, minimal cloud cover and dark skies. But the state's astronomers worry about a variety of threats -- border enforcement among them -- to the pristine conditions that have allowed them to discover new planets, gain important insights into how the universe functions and generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually in economic return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drug smugglers and illegal immigrants making their way north are sometimes visible to astronomers at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory here who take a break from gazing skyward to look around the rough, wooded terrain. But it is not the outlaws that affect their work as much as the authorities who are after them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Border Patrol helicopter shining a blinding beam on a group of suspects runs the risk of interfering with valuable machinery trained upward, like the four massive telescopes, known as Veritas or the Very Energetic Radiation Telescope Array System, that measure gamma rays. ''It's happened,'' said Dan Brocious, spokesman for the observatory, which is jointly run by the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard University and has operated atop this mountaintop since 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Border Patrol says that it tries to steer its helicopters clear of observatories, but that frequent staff turnover has occasionally resulted in missteps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The checkpoints that the Border Patrol has set up around southern Arizona, complete with high-powered beams to light them up at night, have been another sore point, prompting meetings between area astronomers and agents and a pledge from the Border Patrol to reduce the wattage. The lights are among the brightest points now visible at night in the area, astronomers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even car headlights can be a problem for sensitive stargazing, which is why signs along the winding road that leads to the observatory urge drivers to use only their parking lights after dark. The nearly 50 years since the Whipple Observatory was built here in the Coronado National Forest have brought retirement communities, shopping malls and assorted other developments to the area, all of which have boosted the light levels detected by astronomers scrutinizing the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wildfires are another concern in the remote areas where the observatories are located. In 2005, a fire that was caused by a lightning strike came within less than a mile of the Whipple Observatory, which had to be evacuated until firefighters, aided by a sudden rainstorm, were able to control it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, a fire west of Nogales prompted a brief closing of the MMT Observatory, which is also atop Mount Hopkins. The observatory's large telescope, 21 feet in diameter, is the 14th largest in the world and is sought after by researchers looking into deep space. Besides less-than-optimal viewing conditions caused by the fire, operators were worried about the buildup of ash on the mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well after the sun has set, from 8,500 feet up on Mount Hopkins, the second-highest peak in the Santa Rita Range, one can observe both the majestic nature of the universe and the threats to the stargazing that has long gone on here. Competing with moonlight are street lights, traffic lights, security lights and innumerable other forms of illumination. To the north is the Tucson skyline, a vast expanse of soft white and yellow light, which has been managed by municipal dark-sky restrictions and has not grown in intensity anywhere near as fast as the population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are a powerful lobby here when it comes to keeping the skies dark at night, and nearby Tucson is the headquarters for the International Dark-Sky Association, which attempts to press for light restrictions around the world. ''Light pollution is an issue all over the world,'' said Paul J. Groot, an astronomer from the Netherlands who was conducting research on the source of X-rays from other galaxies at the MMT Observatory this week. ''It limits our deep observation of the night sky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An open-pit copper mine that is proposed for an area southeast of Tucson and would operate around the clock has alarmed dark-sky advocates, even though the Rosemont Copper Company has said it plans to abide by Pima County's restrictions on light pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When these observatories were selected, there was hardly anyone living here,'' Mr. Brocious said atop the mountain as darkness and light seemed to compete in all directions. ''Tucson was a sleepy little cow town back then. There's nothing sleepy about it now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 23, 2011, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the growing difficulty caused by light pollution at astronomical observatories in southern Arizona misidentified the part of the large telescope at the MMT Observatory that was endangered by an accumulation of ash from a recent wildfire. It was a mirror, not a lens.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a powerful magnet and an intricate array of sensors, computer processors and high-speed data links, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is designed to measure tiny deflections in the trajectories of cosmic ray particles to look for the telltale signs of antimatter and the unseen dark matter believed to make up nearly 25 percent of the universe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also will be on the lookout for the unexpected as it sifts through torrents of passing protons, electrons and atomic nuclei for the next 10 years or longer, ideally for the remaining life of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We immediately checked all the detectors; everything functioned properly,'' Samuel Chao Chung Ting, the project's principal investigator, told reporters. ''Not a single one was broken, not a single electronic channel was malfunctioning. Right away, we began to see an enormous amount of data coming down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holding up sample graphs showing the passages of an electron and a carbon nucleus, Dr. Ting said, ''We're very pleased. It took us 17 years to build this thing.'' Over time, he said, the scientists on the project hope ''to make an important contribution to our understanding of the origin of the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carried aloft in Endeavour's cargo bay, the 7 1/2-ton Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer was attached to the right side of the space station's solar power truss using the orbiter's robot arm and a similar crane on the lab complex. After the instrument was locked in place, an umbilical carrying power and data was attached by remote control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within two to three hours, scientists and engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston were receiving a steady stream of data. ''We have thousands and thousands of signatures already,'' Dr. Ting said, referring to particle signatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a welcome, long-awaited milestone for a project with a history that reads like ''The Perils of Pauline.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2003 explosion of the space shuttle Columbia, the project was bumped from NASA's manifest. A lobbying campaign by Dr. Ting and his colleagues eventually won over President Obama and key lawmakers, who approved financing for an extra shuttle flight to get the particle-detecting magnet into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a decision to extend the space station's life from 2015 to 2020 and beyond prompted Dr. Ting's team to give up a more powerful but short-lived superconducting magnet in favor of a less powerful version, used in a 1998 test flight, that could last the life of the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Dr. Ting and his team -- more than 600 physicists from 60 institutions in 16 countries -- have spent nearly two decades designing, building, testing and redesigning the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The payoff is finally at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the mysteries the device was designed to explore is what happened to the antimatter that must have been created when the universe was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the universe comes from a big bang, before the big bang it is vacuum,'' Dr. Ting said before Endeavour's launching. ''Nothing exists in vacuum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, he said, ''You have matter, you must have antimatter; otherwise we would not have come from the vacuum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So now the universe is 14 billion years old, you have all of us, made out of matter. The question is, where is the universe made out of antimatter?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another subject of study for the spectrometer is dark matter, the mysterious material believed to provide the gravitational glue that holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together. While Dr. Ting's creation cannot directly detect dark matter, it possibly can detect the particles that would be produced in dark matter collisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To my collaborators and I, the most exciting objective of A.M.S. is to probe the unknown,'' Dr. Ting said, ''to search for phenomena which exist in nature, but yet we have not the tools or the imagination to find.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, as NASA continued its advances in space, on Earth -- in Washington -- it was scolded for tardiness in deciding what it will do after the shuttles are retired in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation sent a letter to Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, demanding documents detailing how the agency was carrying out the blueprint Congress passed last year for future space exploration. The plans called for development of a new heavy-lift rocket and spacecraft for missions beyond low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The senators said NASA had failed to provide required reports to Congress and requested that a NASA official begin briefing them every other week about the agency's efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA's current inaction and indecision in implementing this transition could impact our global standing and take many years and billions of dollars to repair,'' said the letter, signed by Senators John D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat of West Virginia who is chairman of the committee; Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the ranking Republican member; Bill Nelson, a Democrat of Florida and chairman of the space subcommittee; and John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that space was littered with hundreds of billions of planets that had been ejected from the planetary systems that gave them birth and either were going their own lonely ways or were only distantly bound to stars at least 10 times as far away as the Sun is from the Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two Jupiter-mass planets floating around for each of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, according to measurements and calculations by an international group of astronomers led by Takahiro Sumi, of Osaka University in Japan, and reported in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bit of a surprise,'' said David Bennett, a Notre Dame astronomer who was part of the team. Before this research, it was thought that only about 10 or 20 percent of stars harbored Jupiter-mass planets. Now it seems as if the planets outnumber the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The implications of this discovery are profound,'' wrote Joachim Wambsganss, of Heidelberg University in Germany, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution in Washington said, ''It means there are a lot more gas giants out there than previous estimates.'' This, he added, has important consequences for theories of how such planets form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary astronomers say the results will allow them to tap into a whole new unsuspected realm of exoplanets -- as planets outside our own solar system are called -- causing scientists to re-evaluate how many there are, where they are and how they are created, even as astronomers immediately begin to ponder whether the new planets in question are in fact floating free or are just far from their stars, at distances comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune in our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Either there is a large population of Jupiter-mass planets far from their star, or, yes, there are a lot of lonely planets out there,'' said Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two decades, astronomers have identified some 500 planets that are circling other stars, and this year scientists using NASA's Kepler satellite announced 1,235 more candidates. But these were found using methods that favored the detection of planets close to their stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new work was done using a method known as gravitational microlensing, which is more sensitive to planets farther out. It relies on the ability of the gravitational field of a massive object -- in this case a planet and its star -- to bend light and act as a magnifying lens, as predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers from two groups -- Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics, based in New Zealand and Japan, and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, based in Poland and Chile -- monitor the light from a vast field of background stars, looking for brief blips of increased brightness caused by a planet and its host star passing in the foreground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group recorded 10 such events consistent with being caused by planet-size objects but did not detect the corresponding blips from these planets' host stars, suggesting either that they did not belong to any star, having been ejected by gravitational pinball games earlier in their lives, or that they were very distant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bennett said the results were consistent with these new planets' being about the same mass as Jupiter. In that case, he said, the prospects for life on them would be dim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In principle, microlensing could detect planets as small as Earth. Indeed, a microlensing experiment to look for planets was to be part of a new NASA spacecraft known as Wfirst, which was given the highest priority by a prestigious National Academy of Sciences panel last summer. Now, however, it will not fly until the 2020s, if it flies at all, because NASA will not have any money for it until the troubled James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble's successor, is finally launched, perhaps in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why call these things planets rather than small failed stars, like the slightly more massive brown dwarfs? Dr. Bennett said there are simply too many of them, even when nature's propensity to make more and more smaller objects is taken into account. ''We suspect they formed like planets,'' he said, explaining that they were once part of primordial protoplanetary disks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More and better observations should eventually establish whether they are true orphans or just on a long leash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss pointed out that most planetary systems would not have the gravitational oomph to eject so many massive objects. When push comes to shove, moreover, it is always the smaller object that gets sent out into space. There is no way, for example, that our own solar system could have kicked out any of those putative free-floaters, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More likely,'' Dr. Boss wrote in an e-mail, ''these are distant gas giants, much like our own Jupiter and Saturn. That makes our solar system's outer reaches look a little more commonplace.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 8:56 a.m. Eastern time, the spacecraft rose slowly on a pillar of fire, picking up speed and eventually disappearing from view as it stabbed through a layer of clouds on its way to orbit. Commanding the six-man crew was Capt. Mark E. Kelly, Ms. Giffords's husband.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congresswoman, who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in January, watched in private with relatives of other crew members and said, ''Good stuff, good stuff,'' as the shuttle rocketed away, according to her chief of staff, Pia Carusone. Captain Kelly's twin brother, Scott, who is also an astronaut, gave a bouquet of roses to Ms. Giffords, who was wearing her husband's wedding ring on a chain around her neck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, crowds that law enforcement officials had estimated could reach half a million people watched the liftoff, the next to last in the 30-year shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a fantastic launch,'' said Michael P. Moses, director of the mission's management team. ''A great day for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second try at a liftoff for the Endeavour, which was grounded by an electrical short circuit on April 29. NASA officials said that the shuttle's three main engines performed well during the 8 1/2-minute ascent and that the power system that had been the source of the electrical problem functioned perfectly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 minutes into the flight, the crew fired maneuvering engines to alter the shuttle's orbit so it could meet up with the International Space Station on Wednesday, more than 200 miles above the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once docked at the station, the astronauts will begin work on the 16-day mission's main objective: installing the $2 billion Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a giant magnet designed to sift through cosmic particles to find evidence of the elusive so-called dark matter that is thought to pervade the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the launching time approached, low clouds were the only concern, because NASA rules require good visibility should the shuttle have to make an emergency landing back at the space center. The clouds proved no problem, although they did obscure the view of spectators a little more than 20 seconds into the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had the clouds where we needed them, so we went,'' Mr. Moses said. ''We apologize that the view wasn't the best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two hours before the liftoff, NASA technicians had to make a quick repair on one of the shuttle's fragile ceramic tiles, which was found to be damaged when the crew hatch was closed. During the first few minutes of flight, a few small pieces of foam insulation were seen coming off the shuttle's huge external fuel tank, officials said, but a first analysis suggested that they did not cause any damage to the spacecraft. Damage from falling foam led to the destruction of the shuttle Columbia during re-entry in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, Ms. Giffords arrived at the launch control center -- where family members normally view launchings -- about 7 a.m., her chief of staff said. As the weather improved, ''she got very excited 'cause it looked like it was a go,'' Ms. Carusone said at a news conference. By Ms. Giffords's side were her mother, Gloria, and Captain Kelly's two daughters from an earlier marriage, Claire and Claudia. After the liftoff, there were celebratory hugs all around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several hours after the launching, Ms. Giffords left the space center for Houston, where she has been recovering at a rehabilitation hospital. Ms. Carusone said that it had not been decided whether the congresswoman would return for the landing, which is scheduled for June 1 about 2:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked at the news conference whether Ms. Giffords now understands what happened to her, Ms. Carusone replied, ''She's not aware of everything, but as she processes this, as anyone would, she's learned more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carusone said that the brevity of Ms. Giffords's ''good stuff'' comment reflected both the difficulty she had in regaining complete speech abilities and the situation. ''For all of us, there's not many words to describe watching the shuttle launch in person,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that there were no plans for Ms. Giffords to make a public appearance. ''We're far from that,'' she said. ''It's not a discussion we've had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the 25th and last flight of the Endeavour, which was built after the shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after a launching in 1986. The Endeavour, which first flew in 1992, will eventually be put on display at a science museum in Los Angeles. Only the flight of the shuttle Atlantis, scheduled for July, is left on NASA's calendar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Captain Kelly and the shuttle's pilot, Gregory H. Johnson, the Endeavour's passenger manifest consists of four mission specialists: Mike Fincke, Andrew J. Feustel, Gregory Errol Chamitoff and Roberto Vittori, a colonel in the Italian Air Force. The astronauts will conduct four spacewalks, performing maintenance tasks at the station and delivering a crate of spare parts.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who hunt for life on other worlds, water in its liquid form is perhaps the leading indicator. Life as we know it on Earth is based on water and carbon. And if organisms can prosper here in nasty environments -- in geysers, in the depths of the sea, in toxic waste, in water that is too hot, too cold, too acidic or too alkaline -- why could they not prosper out there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists for years regarded liquid water as a solar system rarity, for there was no place apart from Earth that seemed to have the necessary physical attributes, except perhaps Jupiter's ice-covered moon, Europa, which probably concealed a subterranean ocean.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past 20 years of space exploration, however, have caused what the astrobiologist David Grinspoon calls a sea change in thinking. It now appears that gravity, geology, radioactivity and antifreeze chemicals like salt and ammonia have given many ''hostile'' worlds the ability to muster the pressures and temperatures that allow liquid water to exist. And research on Earth has shown that if there is water, there could be life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mars and Venus, on Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan, and even on two outer-belt asteroids, researchers have shown that the presence of liquid water is possible and even likely. Proof of life, of course, will come only when something -- or someone -- puts a drop of alien water under a microscope and sees a microbe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Water and carbon-based life works well,'' Dr. Grinspoon said. ''That doesn't mean it's the only way, but it's the only way we know, and it gives us something to look for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding water in space, in the form of ice, has never been a problem. Hydrogen is the most common element in the solar system, and oxygen is not far behind. When the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, a spiraling disc of dust and gas spun out from the Sun to produce the planets, their moons, and an enormous cloud of comets, planetoids and other bits of cosmic flotsam. Nature endowed much of this debris with a generous helping of water ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liquid water is another matter. The heat of the Sun may melt the ice, but in the vacuum of space there is little or nothing on the surface of most solar system objects to keep the heated molecules together, so they flash instantly away as water vapor. This process is called sublimation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The physics of sublimation are unforgiving. Liquid water needs a delicate balance of temperature and pressure. Ice must be able to melt without boiling off, but the water must stay warm enough that it does not refreeze. On Earth, with a sea level atmospheric pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch, water is liquid between 32 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit. On the unshadowed parts of our Moon, where the atmospheric pressure is zero and daytime temperatures can exceed 260 degrees Fahrenheit, the surface ice is long gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ice survives at very low temperatures, however, and the chunks of debris that linger in the chill reaches of deep space beyond Neptune make up the biggest source of water in the solar system today. These dirty snowballs re-enter the planetary system periodically as comets. When they get close enough to the Sun, the ice begins to sublimate, giving the comets their characteristic tail of dust and water vapor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists say it is likely that much of the ice in the inner solar system came from comets. On Earth, cometary impacts early in the planet's history could have provided this raw material, and the Sun and atmospheric pressure would have done the rest. Earth is the only place in the solar system so far discovered where liquid is the default state of surface water. And Earth is where life proliferates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is maybe not the only place. Dr. Grinspoon has theorized that Venus, whose spectacular volcanism boiled off all its surface water long ago, nevertheless harbored liquid moisture in the noxious clouds of sulfuric acid that cloak the planet. In 2008 the European Space Agency's Venus Express orbiter measured water vapor in the clouds. About 30 miles above the surface in the Venusian mist, where temperatures are about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, extremophiles could find a comfort zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another improbable venue for liquid water is the outer limits of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. There, using infrared telescopes, two teams of astronomers working separately in 2008 and 2009 found water ice on the surface of the asteroid 24 Themis, about 280 million miles from the Sun. Last year, the teams joined forces and found ice on a second asteroid, 65 Cybele, which, with a diameter of 180 miles, was about 1.5 times as large as 24 Themis and 45 million miles farther out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For ice to endure on like objects with no atmosphere that close to the Sun, there must be a mechanism to replenish what is lost to sublimation. Humberto Campins, a University of Central Florida astrophysicist and leader of one of the discovery teams, suggested that the patchy ice was a thin coating of frost from a reservoir hidden below the asteroids' topsoil regolith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the asteroid faced the Sun, heat penetrated the topsoil, causing subsurface ice to sublimate and migrate as water vapor to the surface, where it froze at night only to sublimate again during the day. In a variation on this theme, Dr. Campins said, meteorites could be churning up the asteroid topsoil, thus bringing ice closer to the surface. This process is called ''impact gardening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We suspect that something like this is happening,'' Dr. Campins said, but acknowledged a third possibility: The asteroids could contain enough radioactive isotopes to melt ice deep below the surface, creating liquid water that seeps upward before vaporizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need sufficient pressure and temperature,'' he said. ''But conceptually it's possible.'' Pressure would come from the asteroids' interior gravity, allowing water to exist once the isotopes melt the ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radioactivity is a widespread phenomenon and a likely source of heat energy elsewhere in the solar system. Another heat source is friction, caused most commonly by tidal pressure or wobbling of an object on its axis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence that Jupiter's moon Europa harbors an enormous liquid ocean beneath its icy shell has arisen in part from observations suggesting that tidal forces create heat by stretching and compressing the moon as it rotates around Jupiter in an eccentric orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently scientists have been able to study tidal forces up close during fly-bys of Saturn's moon Enceladus by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. In 2005 Cassini found that Enceladus, with a diameter of only 300 miles, was spewing water ice grains from cracks in its south polar region. The grains were the ''dust'' that formed Saturn's E-ring, and scientists soon began to suspect strongly that the particles came from a subsurface liquid water source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't say it's virtually certain, but I'd give it 80 percent or 90 percent,'' said John Spencer, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>, a member of Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer team. ''Things may be a lot stranger than we imagine, but basically, I suspect we have an ocean.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More disputed is the theory that low-temperature ''cryo-volcanoes'' on Saturn's largest moon, the hydrocarbon-rich Titan, may be belching slushy lava composed of liquid water and ammonia, or some other low-temperature mixture, that freezes on the moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Titan has hydrocarbon sand dunes and methane lakes, and the cryo-volcanism could be hydrocarbon,'' said Jeffrey Kargel, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. ''We would have to go there to know for sure.'' Still, he added, ''there pretty much has to be water ice'' on Titan, since there is ice everywhere else in the solar system where it is cold enough. Titan has a regular orbit, so tidal friction would be minimal. For liquid water to exist, there would have to be a radioactive heat source and antifreeze compounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antifreeze is what Nilton Renno of the University of Michigan was looking for to explain the unforeseen event that befell NASA's Phoenix Lander on the arctic plains of Mars in 2008. Hydrazine thrusters that arrested the lander's descent had blown aside seven inches of Martian topsoil, exposing the expected layer of ice that lay below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four days later, something unexpected happened. Cameras examining the ice discerned a number of blisterlike globules on one of the spacecraft struts. A few days after that, the camera looked again. The globules remained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Dr. Renno, the atmospheric science team leader for Phoenix, did not immediately report it, he suspected he was observing droplets of liquid water. It would have to be salty enough not to vaporize in the Martian atmosphere or freeze at surface temperatures below minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that there needed to be antifreeze. Salt was the likeliest source: ''Suppose you have a swimming pool, and you fill it with saltwater,'' Dr. Renno said. ''When the pool cools down and starts to freeze, pure water becomes ice. The remaining water becomes more saline. It becomes harder to freeze as the salt concentration becomes stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence arrived in two steps. First, the lander's instruments found high salt concentrations in soil surrounding the spacecraft. Then, three weeks after touchdown, the Lander's robotic arm dug a trench in the ice and encountered a soft layer that contrasted with nearby hard ice patches that the lander penetrated with a drill. The slush was a second source of water, and like the first, ''probably filled with salt,'' Dr. Renno said. ''It was almost like ice cream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, ''we kept taking pictures'' of the strut, and 44 days after touchdown the largest droplet disappeared, Dr. Renno recalled. ''It grew too large, and dripped off.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a tour de force of technology and just plain stubbornness spanning half a century and costing more than $750 million, a team of experimenters from Stanford University reported on Wednesday that a set of orbiting gyroscopes had detected a slight sag and an even slighter twist in space-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finding confirms some of the weirdest of the many strange predictions -- like black holes and the expanding universe -- of Albert Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have completed this landmark experiment of testing Einstein's universe,'' Francis Everitt, leader of the project, known as Gravity Probe B, said at a news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington. ''And Einstein survives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was hardly a surprise. Observations of planets, the Moon and particularly the shifting orbits of the Lageos research satellites had convinced astronomers and physicists that Einstein's predictions were on the mark. Nevertheless, scientists said that the Gravity Probe results would live forever in textbooks as the most direct measurements, and that it was important to keep testing theories that were thought to be correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clifford M. Will of Washington University in St. Louis -- who was not part of the team but was chairman of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration advisory committee evaluating its work, and who wrote a book titled ''Was Einstein Right?'' -- said that in science, ''no such book is ever closed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein's theory relates gravity to the sagging of cosmic geometry under the influence of matter and energy, the way a sleeper makes a mattress sag. One consequence is that a massive spinning object like Earth should spin up the empty space around it, the way twirling the straw in a Frappuccino sets the drink and the whole Venti-size cup spinning around with it, an effect called frame dragging. Astronomers think this effect, although minuscule for Earth, could play a role in the black hole dynamos that power quasars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Empty space in the vicinity of Earth is indeed turning, Dr. Everitt reported at the news conference and in a paper prepared for the journal Physical Review Letters, at the leisurely rate of 37 one-thousandths of a second of arc -- the equivalent of a human hair seen from 10 miles away -- every year. With an uncertainty of 19 percent, that measurement was in agreement with Einstein's predictions of 39 milliarcseconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the ''sag'' should alter the space-time geometry around Earth, warping it from the Euclidean ideal and cutting an inch out of the Gravity Probe's orbit around it, so that the circumference is slightly less than the Euclidean ideal of pi times the orbit's diameter, a fact confirmed by the Stanford gyroscopes to an accuracy of 0.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Everitt, who joined the Gravity Probe experiment in 1962 as a young postdoctoral fellow and has worked on nothing else since, the announcement on Wednesday capped a career-long journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment was conceived in 1959, but the technology to make these esoteric measurements did not yet exist, which is why the experiment took so long and cost so much. The gyroscopes, for example, were made of superconducting niobium spheres, the roundest balls ever manufactured, which then had to be flown in a lead bag to isolate them from any other influences in the universe, save the subversive curvature of space-time itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before the probe's launching, Dr. Francis said the project had been canceled at least seven times, ''depending on what you mean by canceled.'' It was finally sent into orbit in 2004 and operated for some 17 months, but not all went well. When the scientists began analyzing their data, they discovered that patches of electrical charge on the niobium balls had generated extra torque on the gyroscopes, causing them to drift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take five more years to understand the spurious signals and retrieve the gravity data by dint of an effort that Dr. Will called ''nothing less than heroic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the NASA grant ran out. Dr. Everitt secured another one from Richard Fairbank, a financier and son of one of the experiment's founders, William Fairbank, that was matched by NASA and Stanford. When that ran out and NASA turned him down for a new grant, Dr. Everitt obtained a $2.7 million grant from Turki al-Saud, a Stanford graduate and vice president for research institutes at the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- An electrical problem forced NASA on Friday to postpone the launching of the shuttle Endeavour, giving President Obama and hundreds of thousands of spectators a lesson in the fickle nature of space technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than four hours before the scheduled 3:47 p.m. liftoff, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials announced that it would be delayed at least until Monday afternoon while technicians tried to fix the problem, which affects equipment that supplies hydraulic power to move the shuttle's engines and flaps during ascent and re-entry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials suggested that the launching could be delayed further. ''We will not fly this machine until it is ready,'' said Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, ''and today it was not ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay frustrated huge crowds that had gathered outside the space center to watch the start of the next-to-last mission in the 30-year shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama, who had been scheduled to watch the launching with his wife, Michelle, and daughters, was touring tornado damage in Alabama when the postponement was announced. He decided to visit the space center anyway, arriving about two hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the launching control center, the president and his wife met for about 10 minutes with Gabrielle Giffords, the wounded Arizona Democratic congresswoman and wife of the mission commander, Capt. Mark E. Kelly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before going in to see Ms. Giffords, Mr. Obama greeted Captain Kelly in a corridor. The men shook hands and embraced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obamas also met with the five other members of the shuttle crew. With their daughters, they toured the building where the Atlantis spacecraft is being prepared for the 135th and final shuttle mission, in late June. They walked under the shuttle, getting a close look at its thermal tiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts are under quarantine rules before a launching and ordinarily their contact with others, even family members, is restricted, but NASA officials said flight doctors had cleared the Obamas to meet with the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giffords, who suffered a severe head wound in a shooting in January, had arrived on Wednesday to watch the launching. There was no immediate word as to whether she would stay in Florida or return to the Houston rehabilitation hospital where she has been recovering for the past two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts had undergone final medical checks and donned orange flight suits and were on their way to the launching pad in a van when the postponement was announced. The van made a U-turn and parked briefly at the control center before returning to the astronauts' quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever it begins, the mission, to the International Space Station, is scheduled to last two weeks. The Endeavour crew will install a $2 billion particle-physics experiment, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, at the space station, where it will search for evidence of the elusive ''dark matter'' that is thought to be ubiquitous in the universe. The shuttle will also deliver spare parts, and the crew will perform maintenance tasks outside the station in four spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Friday, preparations for the mission had been relatively smooth, with weather the major concern. But postponements due to equipment problems are not uncommon, and NASA officials had previously said they would not forgo safety procedures just because the president was going to be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach said the problem that forced the postponement was most likely an electrical short in an area of the shuttle that would take time to reach. Shortly after the decision was announced, technicians drained the spacecraft's huge external fuel tank, which had been filled with liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel early Friday. The fuels must be removed before it is safe to work on the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach and other officials said that depending on the extent of the problem, a Monday launching might be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has a launching window each afternoon through Wednesday; after that the Endeavour might have to wait until May 9 or 10 to try again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TITUSVILLE, Fla. -- As it has many times before, sometime Friday afternoon the stretch of Route 1 in front of Chris Galorneau's restaurant will turn into a parking lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drivers will abandon their cars, and customers will pour out of the Village Inn, where Mr. Galorneau is the general manager, as they will at businesses up and down Route 1, which serves as a main street for this city of 45,000.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before 4 p.m., all eyes will turn toward the Kennedy Space Center, 12 miles east across the wide expanse of the Indian River Lagoon. There, at Launch Pad 39A, if the weather allows, the shuttle Endeavour will thunder into the sky on a pedestal of flame, carrying six astronauts on a two-week mission to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The place will clear out,'' Mr. Galorneau said Wednesday while waitresses bustled around him, and every diner got a free piece of pie for Pie Rush Wednesday. ''Everybody crowds down to the river. And then, as soon it goes up, 10 minutes later I have a packed restaurant and I have a waiting list for hours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brief but jaw-dropping spectacle that is a shuttle launching has occurred 133 times before, and Mr. Galorneau has seen his share (except for the time he was stuck inside making pancake batter -- ''You can't run a pancake house without pancake batter,'' he said -- and got to feel the building shake). This launching is expected to be one of the biggest ever, with perhaps three-quarters of a million people jamming Titusville, Cape Canaveral and other nearby towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the interest in the Endeavour mission is no doubt because of the drama involving its commander, Capt. Mark E. Kelly, whose wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, was gravely wounded in a shooting in January. She is here to watch the launching. And some of it is no doubt because of an anticipated visit by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the main draw is the fact that after this liftoff, and the launching of the Atlantis in two months, there will be no more space shuttle voyages. After three decades, the program has just about reached the end of the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're not going to see another one -- this is going to be it,'' said Truman Scarborough, who was Titusville's mayor in the 1980s and served as a Brevard County commissioner for 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scarborough and others said that for the past three or four launchings, the crowds have been getting larger as the program nears its end. Officials were forecasting perhaps a million or more for the Atlantis launch, a crowd that would rival the glory days of the space program, when a mammoth Saturn V rocket propelled the Apollo 11 astronauts toward the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the space center, the shuttle program's demise is apparent in the physical changes taking place. At Launch Pad 39B, a twin to the pad where the Endeavour sits, workers were dismantling, bit by bit, the giant steel structures that coddled many shuttles before liftoff -- including the Challenger, which rocketed off in 1986, never to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several miles away, at a huge bay where workers would normally be swarming over the shuttle Discovery to ready it for its next mission, they were instead preparing it to be shipped next year to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Titusville and other towns nearby, the changes are being measured in terms of humans, not hardware. While the shuttle program never really achieved its lofty goal of making spaceflight routine, it did provide a routine for thousands of aerospace workers here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of them -- mostly employees of contractors, not NASA -- have already received pink slips. Many more layoffs and buyouts are to come this summer -- in all, about 8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been our livelihood forever,'' said the Rev. Tom Porter, pastor of Temple Baptist Church here, who said some laid-off members of his congregation had already left for new jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titusville and other communities saw this coming; discussions about the end of the shuttle program began as early as seven years ago. And old-timers have seen this kind of thing before, especially when the Apollo moon program ended in 1973. ''In the early '70s, I used to come over here from St. Petersburg, and it was a ghost town,'' Pastor Porter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, it was the shuttle program that shook the area out of its post-Apollo doldrums. And while NASA plans eventually to replace the shuttles with commercial manned rockets that would use the space center, no one knows how soon that would happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials say that the region is much more diverse economically now and that the effect of the space industry, for better or worse, is not as great as it used to be. With its many shuttered businesses -- the Miracle City Mall, just down the block from Mr. Galorneau's restaurant, is a shell of its former self, with only a few stores open -- Titusville is not that different from other Florida cities, far from the Space Coast, which overbuilt in the boom years only to fall hard in the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the economic diversity, Mr. Scarborough said, there is something else that is different: life is more complicated. Apollo employed a lot of young engineers who quickly pulled up stakes when the program closed. These days the engineers and other workers are older, and many of their spouses work. Leaving for a new job may not be so easy; it may not even be desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Breaking and running, when you're within 10 or 15 years of retirement, doesn't seem to be making sense to them,'' Mr. Scarborough said. ''Which is not what happened after Apollo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pastor Porter said that this week his congregation prayed that President Obama, who has continued to nudge the manned spaceflight program away from NASA and toward private companies, ''would see the launch and be so moved to keep the program going.'' Did he think that would happen? ''No,'' he said. ''Humanly speaking, no way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pastor Porter said that some workers have already taken steps to be ready for layoffs. But others have not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Bible says consider the ants,'' he said. ''The ants -- you know, they toil, they save up, they prepare. Yeah, in a perfect world that would be great.''</p>

It is made of plywood and does not have wings. Douglas R. King, the museum's chief executive, discusses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You had been planning for a shuttle for years. You had legislators pushing for it. You built a special climate-controlled building. What happened?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, there's only four of them. We've actually been working on this for 10 years -- longer, even. We wanted to make sure we had this very important artifact. The first letter went out to NASA after President Reagan announced the program, so you could say 25 years. Having a building had been one of the original criteria, but that didn't seem as important to them in the end as population and access to global markets. I can't argue that New York and Los Angeles aren't bigger than us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What was your response when NASA announced its decision?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A shuttle would have been our first choice. I won't pretend we're not disappointed, but we're moving forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are the plans for the Space Gallery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We will have a full-size mockup of the space shuttle -- a full fuselage shuttle trainer. It looks exactly like the shuttle except that it doesn't have wings. One advantage is that because it is not a priceless artifact like the shuttle, we'll be able to use it for educational purposes. Some people, but not everyone, will be able to go inside. They won't be able to do that with the shuttles. The trainer is about the size of a 747. The tail is 56 feet high. From the outside it will look exactly like the shuttle except for the wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You raised $9 million in public donations to build the Space Gallery. Were contributors upset once they heard the gallery wouldn't actually house a shuttle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Everyone was disappointed. We did our best. We did everything we could to get it. I don't feel like this is a consolation prize. I was very impressed with the way the community accepted this so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is the museum going to need to change its marketing strategy? Will the admission price you must have had penciled in stay the same?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We never got tremendously ramped up for it. We always knew there was a lot of competition, that it was always an ''if.'' I know I'm sounding Pollyanna-ish, but we won't just be attracting people to come to see the Space Shuttle, we'll be representing the entirety of the space program now.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens when you have the right stuff at the wrong time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of NASA's astronaut corps have been asking just that, now that the space shuttle program is ending and their odds of flying anywhere good anytime soon are getting smaller. The Endeavour is scheduled to launch this week, and the Atlantis is supposed to fly the last shuttle mission in June -- and all the seats are spoken for.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Morale is pretty low,'' said Leroy Chiao, a former astronaut who now works for a company that wants to offer space flights for tourists. ''This is a time of great uncertainty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under President Obama, NASA's human spaceflight program has been curtailed. The Ares I and Constellation programs, which were meant to succeed the space shuttles and take astronauts to the moon, were canceled, and NASA is instead hiring outside companies to devise alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when the Obama family heads to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week to sit with Gabrielle Giffords, the injured Arizona congresswoman, as she watches her husband, Capt. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, take off for the International Space Station, it will be one of the last spectacles of its kind for a while. Over the next few years, American astronauts will be competing for a handful of slots on the International Space Station, flying there on Russian Soyuz capsules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We hope we will overcome this hurdle and continue to explore,'' said Peggy A. Whitson, the head of NASA's astronaut office, whose job includes selecting the astronauts who will fly each space mission. While people's spirits are a little down, she said, ''we'll have to see -- NASA has gone through different phases like this before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current situation may not dampen the career aspirations of the elementary school set, but last year alone, 20 astronauts left NASA's active-duty roster; today, 61 remain, down from a peak of about 150 in 2000. Back then, NASA was gearing up to staff the International Space Station and the shuttles that supplied it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift has made a big difference to people like John M. Grunsfeld, the Dr. Fix-It of the Hubble Space Telescope, who has flown five missions for NASA. After his last flight, in May 2009, he asked Dr. Whitson about his chances of returning to space. ''She was honest,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Slim to none.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Whitson had dangled even a small chance at a plum assignment, like commanding the International Space Station, ''I probably would have stayed,'' said Dr. Grunsfeld, 52. But she did not. So in January 2010, he left NASA to become deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another astronaut for whom the new realities presented a problem was Capt. Scott D. Altman of the Navy, who has flown four missions for NASA. But at 6-foot-4, he does not fit into a Soyuz capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his last shuttle flight in 2009, Captain Altman, 51, saw the writing on the wall. As he wrestled with the decision over whether to leave NASA, the Obama administration made the decision to scrap Constellation and Ares I. He announced last August that he would depart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving NASA ''was the right decision,'' Captain Altman said, but ''there are some regrets from time to time.'' He now works for ASRC Research and Technology Solutions in Maryland, which does engineering work for NASA and other federal agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will still be hiring astronauts, though not people of Captain Altman's vintage. In the next year or two, as more people leave or retire, the agency will recruit a new class of 6 to 12 astronauts, Dr. Whitson said. If NASA decides to reduce tours of duty at the space station from six months to four, that would mean a need for even more astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We briefed the entire office on what to expect,'' said Dr. Whitson, who is herself an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, opportunities for astronauts outside of NASA are small but growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic, part of Richard Branson's empire, is seeking three space pilots for its SpaceShipTwo rocket plane, which may begin space tourism trips next year. While SpaceShipTwo will take suborbital hops that provide only a few minutes of weightlessness, other companies -- like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, better known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- are developing spacecraft that will be able to fly to the International Space Station and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrett E. Reisman, who joined the astronaut corps in 1998, left NASA last month for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which was founded by the Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk. Dr. Reisman had logged more than three months in space and done work on the space station's robotic arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being an astronaut is the coolest job ever,'' said Dr. Reisman, 43. ''It was very, very difficult to voluntarily leave.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Reisman had stayed at NASA, he would have had a chance to fly again, but he decided to move on. Now he is working on a rocket (the Falcon 9) and a spacecraft (the Dragon) that are meant to take passengers and cargo to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an engineer's dream to design a spaceship,'' he said. ''To me, it seems like we're on the verge of a golden age of spaceflight -- that's where I wanted to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For every astronaut who quits NASA because of age or a lack of opportunity, there are any number of young people aspiring to fill their shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job is still as romantic as the standards are stringent. According to NASA's Web site, astronaut candidates must be able to swim three lengths of a pool in a flight suit and tennis shoes; an advanced degree in science or math is a plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The requirements are even stricter for people who want to work in the space station: you must speak Russian, know robotics, be trained for spacewalks and be healthy enough to spend six months in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This formidable checklist has helped NASA nudge some astronauts aside. But it has not dulled anyone's memories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being in space is like being someplace magic,'' said Col. Pamela Ann Melroy of the Air Force, the second female astronaut to command a shuttle mission. She left NASA in 2009, knowing that there would be intense jockeying by astronauts seeking to command one of the few remaining flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't really want to get into situation where I was hanging around hoping that I would get one of them,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Melroy is still wistful about the lost prospect of flying on the Ares I. ''That would have been a hoot,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine that someone offered to dump 1,100 busted washing machines onto a prime piece of riverfront property in Midtown Manhattan, pitching the idea as a potential tourist draw and educational attraction. New Yorkers are smart. Many -- perhaps even most -- of them would say: ''Are you kidding me? You're just looking for an easy way to get rid of 150,000 pounds of junk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same response if the offer was for 499,000 first-generation iPhones or 11,000 broken toaster ovens, all of which would also weigh about 150,000 pounds. Yet the other day, when the city got word that another 150,000-pound castoff was headed this way, moderate rejoicing broke out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum was awarded custody of the Enterprise, the space shuttle that, until now, had been on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington. The Smithsonian is going to get one of the newly retired space shuttles (one of the real ones; read on) and so is magnanimously regifting this one. It is to go on display near the great ship, which, come to think of it, is another federal hand-me-down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not for a minute suggesting that the Intrepid, an aircraft carrier with a distinguished record of service in war and in peace, is anything less than a credit to Pier 86. The Enterprise, though, is a bit of a downgrade; it's a prototype that never actually flew in space, never docked with anything and never harbored Sigourney Weaver and slimy parasitic aliens. From there it's just a short step to federal junk with no historic value at all -- misprinted tax forms, past-date hardtack, obsolete nuclear missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor am I saying that the thing won't attract tourists, because, as 18 years' worth of ''Cats'' proved, tourists will apparently pay to see just about anything. It's just the precedent I'm worried about, especially now, when Washington politicians are eager to get rid of any evidence of their wasteful ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, you're saying, 20 other suitors were going after the Enterprise and the three real shuttles (which went to Cape Canaveral, Fla; Los Angeles; and Washington). Could all of them really have been hoodwinked? Are the feds really smart enough to fool that many people into vying for the right to take government discards? Remember, this is NASA we're talking about; these folks put men on the moon back when most Americans still had black-and-white televisions and thought that electric can openers were the pinnacle of technological achievement. Yeah, they're smart enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to worry, though. If the federal government is going to make a habit of dumping its castoffs here, we have people who can turn that into a positive. They're called artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of artists create the old-fashioned way, by painting, taking a photograph or hiring models to stand naked in the Museum of Modern Art, but there's a subset of them who make art out of other people's throwaways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Trash speaks to me,'' Barbara Lubliner of Manhattan, one such artist, told me by way of explaining how to go about turning junk into art. ''It says: 'I've got potential. Give me new context. Keep me around until you can vision me in a new life.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lubliner is among more than 50 artists contributing to an exhibition opening this weekend at the Williamsburg Art and Historical Center in Brooklyn called ''Art From Detritus: Upcycling With Imagination,'' in which all the works are made from recycled materials and trash. Figuring that you've got to have a sense of humor to make artwork out of trash, I asked a few of these artists to ruminate both on what it takes to turn junk into something someone might want to look at and on what they would do with a used space shuttle if given one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd use it as an art studio,'' Ms. Lubliner said. Bernard Klevickas, a sculptor in Long Island City, Queens, whose work is also in the show, was equally utilitarian. ''Start a community garden in it,'' he said. ''The bay doors could be removed and a greenhouse roof installed for the winter season. The shuttle would in essence become a giant planter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's Chris Noel, who makes what he calls debris paintings using detritus of various sorts. He's not part of the Williamsburg show and lives in Maryland. So what's he doing in this column? He lived for years in Virginia, one of the states where New York has been dumping its trash for some time. And so, as an oblique what-goes-around-comes-around gesture, I'm giving him the last word, to relate what he'd do with a discarded shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe I would convert it into a land yacht and tour the country,'' Mr. Noel said. ''Along the way, I would ask all those I came in contact with to make their mark on it in some way, no matter how large or small. I would travel until there was not a speck of unmarked space, and then I would park it and declare it finished. I don't think an item as significant as this should be entrusted to any one individual. This should be the people's art. Then you either park it or send it into space for its final voyage, never to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''O.K., that's kind of thick with peace, love and harmony,'' he added, ''but maybe that's not so bad.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced Monday that it was distributing $269 million to four companies to develop spacecraft to take its astronauts to orbit in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The awards, part of what NASA calls its commercial crew development program, are a bet, pushed by the Obama administration, that commercial companies will be able to get people to and from orbit more quickly and less expensively.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip McAlister, acting director of the program, said NASA received 22 proposals and sought additional information on 8 of them before deciding on the winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif., which already has a contract to carry cargo to the International Space Station, will receive $75 million toward making its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule suitable for passengers. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had two successful launchings of its Falcon 9 last year, the second with an empty Dragon capsule that successfully orbited the planet before parachuting back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span> of Louisville, Colo., will receive $80 million for its small space plane design, and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> will receive $92.3 million for a capsule design. Blue Origin, a quiet, enigmatic company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, will receive $22 million to work on its capsule design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For each of the companies, the money will finance one year of work beginning in May, and the companies will be paid as they meet milestones outlined in their proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another winner -- even though NASA did not give it any money -- may be the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>. Except for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the other companies need a rocket to fly their spacecraft, and the alliance's Atlas V rocket is a likely choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also passed over a proposal from <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>. to develop a commercial version of the Ares I rocket, which Alliant said would cost much less than an Atlas V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This second round of commercial crew development awards is NASA's biggest step so far in breaking away from its past practice of developing and operating its own spacecraft like the space shuttles and before that the behemoth Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttles are retired this year, the United States will have to rely on the Russians, at a cost of more than $50 million a seat, for taking NASA astronauts to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McAlister said NASA was aiming for commercial providers to begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station in the ''middle part of the decade,'' although that depended on future financing from NASA and the companies meeting their technical goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are hopefully going to make a lot of progress over this next year so we can get there as soon as we can,'' Mr. McAlister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next phase, NASA is to hold a competition to provide crew transportation services, which will be open to all companies, not just the ones that received money in the current round. NASA is still working on details of how the competition would be set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The strategy is still in development,'' Mr. McAlister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had been developing its own follow-on rocket to the shuttles, the Ares I, as part of an ambitious program to send astronauts back to the Moon. But the Obama administration decided that effort cost too much and moved to cancel it and the Ares I last year. Instead, it wanted to spend $6 billion over five years to finance commercial crew efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, NASA awarded $50 million in its first round of financing for commercial crew development. In his request for the next fiscal year's budget, President Obama asked for $850 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many members of Congress remain skeptical of the commercial crew approach. While a blueprint for NASA's priorities over the next three years passed last year includes money for commercial crew, it also includes much more money for NASA to develop a larger capsule and a big rocket for missions beyond low-Earth orbit. Congress also wanted the NASA rocket and capsule as a backup in case the commercial efforts failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While I know that commercial companies could eventually become successful,'' Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said during a hearing last week, ''I do not feel that the information available justifies such a large investment of federal dollars this year for commercial vehicles.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's space shuttles, which have been carrying astronauts aloft for 30 years, were assigned to their final destinations on Tuesday: one will head to the nation's capital, another to Los Angeles, and the third from its current home at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to the center's visitor complex next door.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a ceremony commemorating the shuttle program, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, made the long-awaited announcement of where the soon-to-be museum pieces would end up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery, which completed its final flight last month, is headed to the Smithsonian, for display at the spacious Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington Dulles International Airport. The Endeavour, currently on the launching pad for its final space trip, will go to the California Science Center. The Atlantis, scheduled for its last mission in June, will go to the Kennedy visitor complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The audience at the Kennedy ceremony erupted into cheering and whooping as General Bolden announced the Atlantis's destination. ''I guess I got something right today,'' the general said with a laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conspicuous among the unsuccessful hopefuls were the Museum of Flight in Seattle, which had already begun construction of a wing that it hoped would house an orbiter; the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio; and NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas, the site of mission control for the 135 shuttle missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointment in Houston was pronounced. Representative Pete Olson, a Republican whose district includes the space center, said in a statement, ''This oversight smacks of a political gesture in an agency that has always served above politics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Discovery headed to the Smithsonian, the museum will no longer have need for the Enterprise, the shuttle that has been on display there since 2003. The Enterprise, which was used for early glide tests but was never sent into orbit, will now go the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-one institutions across the country had put in bids for one of the orbiters, and in recent weeks, General Bolden was inundated with letters and phone calls from members of Congress and others advocating various sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were many, many worthy institutions that requested an orbiter, and only four to go around,'' General Bolden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced on Tuesday that hundreds of other pieces of hardware from the shuttle program would be heading to various museums. The Seattle museum, for example, will not receive a flown orbiter, but it will get a full-size mock-up that is now at the Johnson Space Center and is used for astronaut training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had been expected to make its museum choices last year, but that was when the final shuttle flight had been scheduled for last September. As the schedule for the final missions was stretched out, so were the preparations for the shuttles' post-flying careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, General Bolden chose Tuesday for the announcement to coincide with the anniversaries of two historic moments in space flight: the 50th anniversary of the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who was the first human in space, and the 30th anniversary of the first launching of a space shuttle, the Columbia, in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two shuttles -- and the astronauts aboard -- were lost in the last 30 years. The Challenger disintegrated upon liftoff in January 1986 because of a leaky booster rocket, and 17 years later, the Columbia broke up as it returned to Earth because of wing damage caused by falling insulating foam during liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the Columbia, President George W. Bush decided to resume flying the three remaining shuttles -- the Discovery, the Atlantis and the Endeavour, which had been built as a replacement for the Challenger -- but then to retire them as soon as construction of the International Space Station was complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA inquired a few years ago whether any museums or other institutions had an interest in acquiring a shuttle. Potential bidders were told that educational programs would have to accompany the exhibits, and that the shuttles would have to reside in an indoor, climate-controlled environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning institutions will now have to negotiate with NASA over the cost, estimated at $28.8 million apiece, of preparing the shuttles for display and moving them to their destinations. But not all of them will have to find that much money: Congress exempted the Smithsonian, and the transportation costs for the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex -- instead of traveling piggyback on a 747, the Atlantis is to be towed just a short way down the road -- will be significantly lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the orbiters may go on a farewell tour. NASA is looking into ''possibly taking them on a tour around various locations throughout the country while they're en route to their final destinations,'' said Michael Curie, a spokesman for the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA expects to deliver the shuttles next year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONGTIME stargazers learned the basics of the night sky the hard way -- with pencils, star charts and lots of patience with their telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now high-tech equipment and smartphone apps are making the task a lot less daunting for beginners.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New point-and-shoot telescopes, for example, require only the push of a button to go into action: Plunk one down in the driveway and the device gets its own bearings, aligning itself with the stars above so it can tell you that the twinkling light in the eyepiece is Betelgeuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three models of these new, self-aligning telescopes, costing about $700 to $800, will be offered this July by Celestron. The company's new line, called SkyProdigy, is intended for amateurs who don't have in-depth knowledge of the night sky, or may not even have a clue of how to set up a telescope, said Danyal J. Medley, a principal engineer at the company in Torrance, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even seasoned astronomy experts are heralding such automation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the telescope that sets itself up, so anyone can easily use it, is great,'' said Jay Pasachoff, chairman of the astronomy department and director of the Hopkins Observatory at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. ''This kind of telescope makes it possible for people to be out in their backyards and look at the most interesting astronomical objects within minutes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find its position and then recognize the stars above, the telescope has a digital camera that takes pictures of the sky. It then compares them with its computerized database of stored images, Mr. Medley said. The process typically takes less than three minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automated telescopes that can find celestial objects with no help from humans are not new. Telescopes have long had motors to drive them, allowing built-in processing and databases. Users of some older telescopes, for example, can choose ''Saturn'' from the menu on the hand controller, recentering the eyepiece over the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even these go-to telescopes, as they are known, must be set up properly, said Tom Kovach, customer service manager at Astronomics.com, based in Norman, Okla. ''It only takes a few minutes to do this,'' he said, ''but you have to be technically savvy, and some people are defeated by the process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celestron's line, as well as the LightSwitch line from <span class="companylink">Meade Instruments</span> in Irvine, Calif., fills that last niche in automation, he said. ''The go-to's make it easier, but they are only as good as the alignment you give them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amateur stargazers are also finding a wealth of data via low-cost technology like smartphone apps. Smartphones, with their cameras and abundant processing power, offer novel features that telescopes cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, United Soft Media offers the app Redshift for iPhone and iPad ($11.99 at iTunes) that identifies bright stars or planets you can see in the night sky. It can also simulate a ride on a spacecraft taking you on a tour of distant planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the App Smart column of The New York Times reviewed several other astronomy-related apps including Star Walk ($3 for the iPhone; $5 for the iPad) and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Sky Map for Android phones (free).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smartphone apps and accessories for stargazing are so popular that they will have a separate block of vendors at the Northeast Astronomy Forum and Telescope Show, to be held April 16 and 17 in Suffern, N.Y., said Alan Traino, chairman of the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apps can lead to more telescope sales, said Mr. Kovach of Astronomics.com. ''People come in with their phones,'' he said, on which they have looked at labeled versions of the night sky. ''They say, 'I want to get a telescope to see this for real' .''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR those who want to meld the benefits of telescopes with smartphones, attachments are available. A simple adapter, the MX-1 from Magnilux ($45 at magnilux.com), clamps an iPhone directly onto the telescope eyepiece, said Robert Buchanan, the president of the company, based in West Melbourne, Fla. With that, users can take snapshots of Saturn, the moon, Jupiter and other bright objects via the telescope. ''You won't get distant galaxies,'' he said, ''but it will get you started.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael L. Weasner, an amateur astronomer in <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>, Ariz., tried the MX-1 with his telescopes, as well as with binoculars and other devices. ''You can say to friends you have over: 'Come and look at this. I have a picture of the moon.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chris Lintott, director of citizen science at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, said he believed that the availability of beginners' tools like apps and self-aligning telescopes would help drive interest in astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People can find out much more easily what that bright thing in the sky is that interests them,'' he said. ''And once they've found out that bright star is a planet, I think it's natural to want to learn more about it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOVIET sculpture renders all its subjects larger than life, but few more so than Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space on April 12, 1961, nearly 50 years ago. A gleaming, 125-foot-tall titanium statue of the world's most famous cosmonaut stands at the nexus of three freeways in Moscow, arms outstretched like a cold war superhero.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin's achievement, and the Soviet playbook that shaped it, made him the most celebrated Soviet hero since Lenin, a triumph of nationalist glory, a role model for the young, a hypermasculine sex symbol. His deification set the ''right stuff'' tone that NASA would follow with its own astronauts: the lumbering icons in their puffy, complicated suits, incapable of error or weakness or even, it sometimes seemed, emotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, Gagarin was 5 feet 2 inches tall and nice as heck. He was chosen because of his willingness to follow orders, to be a small part of the technological immensity of the Soviet space program. It is this quality, rather than courage or bravado, that makes him, in a sense, a most modern spacefarer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin was, to be sure, the model Soviet citizen. When I visited the Yuri Gagarin museum in Star City, near Moscow, the curator showed me his childhood report cards, ''all with excellent marks,'' and a toy airplane he made at the industrial school he attended as a boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for all his precocious talent, the space program's chief designer, Sergey Korolev, is reported to have chosen Gagarin for the history-making mission partly because he was the only one of the original cosmonaut squad to remove his shoes before stepping inside a model of the Vostok I capsule in which he would travel into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody liked him,'' said the curator, fanning herself as though overcome by the mere thought of him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Gagarin's affable willingness to go with the program made him perfect for a mission in which he was, essentially, human cargo. Beyond coming down alive -- nailing it first -- his only assignment was to write down his observations and sensations (which he mostly failed to do, because he inadvertently let go of his pencil in orbit, and it floated out of sight).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the chimpanzees and the Moscow street mutts that went into space before them, Gagarin and other early spacemen were in part an experimental payload. There was a great deal of concern, at both the Soviet space agency and at NASA, about the unknown physiological and psychological consequences of space and zero gravity. Would breaching the infinite blow the crewman's mind? Would weightlessness cause his eyeballs to change shape, his blood to stop circulating? Gagarin went up to find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strangely, the first man to ascend into the cosmos was a skilled pilot forbidden to use his skills. The controls of Vostok I were locked; the capsule was maneuvered entirely from the ground. As Gagarin himself put it, ''I'm not sure if I was the first man in space or the last dog.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing about Gagarin's personality prevented him from becoming a Soviet demigod. His museum holds hundreds of official gifts and honors bestowed on him during the 27-nation tour that followed his flight: case after case of plaques and medals and proclamations and keys, a sombrero from the president of Mexico, giant salad tongs from who knows where.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin was uncomfortable with the adulation and fuss. He wrote in his autobiography of noticing that his shoelace was untied while he walked the red carpet before the presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and being unable to think about anything else. When he found himself seated beside Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace luncheon, he reached under the table and squeezed her knee -- not out of lasciviousness but, Gagarin biographer Lev Danilkin told me, ''to receive evidence that he was not sleeping.'' (Her Majesty pretended not to notice.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contemporary space travelers have hewed closer to the real-life Yuri Gagarin than his larger-than-life public image. Whatever bravado was tolerated during NASA's earliest manned space programs has been ironed out; in an era of large-crew, long-duration missions, it is very much the wrong stuff. There is no room for expansive egos, for swagger and machismo, on a year-long stay in a bus-sized space station habitat or a two-plus-year mission to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent list of desirable attributes in NASA astronauts includes empathy, fairness and a good sense of humor. It's hard to say whether and when the United States will send a human being to Mars, but Yuri Gagarin would be as perfect a choice today as he was in 1961.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the planet Mercury, and this month it is ready for its extended close-up. On Wednesday, NASA showed off the first pictures taken by its Mercury Messenger spacecraft since entering the planet's orbit on March 17. The Messenger is to spend at least a year photographing, measuring and studying Mercury.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit to Mercury is the last frontier of planetary exploration that NASA will reach for quite some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the last of the classical planets, the planets known to the astronomers of Egypt and Greece and Rome and the Far East,'' said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the mission's principal investigator. ''It's an object that has captivated the imagination and the attention of astronomers for millennia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But never before has science had such a good front-row seat. ''We're there now,'' Dr. Solomon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency has sent orbiters to five planets -- Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn -- but it will most likely be another decade or two before a spacecraft enters orbit around Uranus or Neptune. (A study on future planetary missions put a Uranus orbiter on the wish list.) NASA does have a spacecraft, New Horizons, that will zoom past Pluto in 2015, but, alas, Pluto is no longer counted as a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury has been seen close up, albeit briefly, in half a dozen flybys by NASA probes: three by the Mariner 10 in the 1970s and three by the Messenger in the last three years. But now that the Messenger has pulled into an orbit of Mercury, planetary scientists will be able to get their first long look at the smallest of the eight planets. The day side of Mercury can broil at 800 degrees Fahrenheit; the night side drops to minus 300 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly intriguing, scientists say, are the shadows in craters near Mercury's poles. There, the Sun never shines, and in the frigidity, some scientists expect that the Messenger will find frozen water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Messenger arrived at its final destination after a 6.5-year loop the loop through the inner solar system. A 15-minute engine burn slowed the spacecraft sufficiently for it to be captured by Mercury's gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, the Messenger loops around the planet on a highly elliptical orbit, dipping down as close to 160 miles to Mercury's surface and rising as far up as 9,300 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its arrival, engineers have been checking out the orbiter's systems and gear. Finding everything in working order, they turned on the instruments, including the camera. The first picture, showing a bright crater called Debussy, was taken early Tuesday. By the end of Thursday, 1,500 photographs will have been taken. More than 75,000 are planned over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's seven instruments have also begun measuring emissions of neutrons, X-rays and gamma rays, which will allow scientists to deduce many of the minerals of the surface. The extended observation will help them understand how Mercury, which is half the mass of Mars, still has a magnetic field -- presumably generated by a molten outer core -- while Mars does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James W. Head III, a geology professor at Brown University and an investigator on the Messenger mission, said Mercury could even give clues about how plate tectonics -- the motion of pieces of crust -- started on Earth. On other bodies, like Mars and the Earth's moon, there is no sign of plate tectonics, with the crust remaining in one piece. On Mercury, however, there are long tectonic ridges extending thousands of miles, which could have represented the first stage of the crust breaking up into plates, although the pieces never started moving as on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of embryonic, halted,'' Dr. Head said. ''It didn't quite get going, but it could give us clues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will officially begin its scientific measurements on Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I REMEMBER the first time the concept of another world entered my mind. It was during a walk with my father in our garden in Sri Lanka. He pointed to the Moon and told me that people had walked on it. I was astonished: Suddenly that bright light became a place that one could visit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schoolchildren may feel a similar sense of wonder when they see pictures of a Martian landscape or Saturn's rings. And soon their views of alien worlds may not be confined to the planets in our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After millenniums of musings and a century of failed attempts, astronomers first detected an exoplanet, a planet orbiting a normal star other than the Sun, in 1995. Now they are finding hundreds of such worlds each year. Last month, NASA announced that 1,235 new possible planets had been observed by Kepler, a telescope on a space satellite. Six of the planets that Kepler found circle one star, and the orbits of five of them would fit within that of Mercury, the closest planet to our Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By timing the passages of these five planets across their sun's visage -- which provides confirmation of their planetary nature -- we can witness their graceful dance with one another, choreographed by gravity. These discoveries remind us that nature is often richer and more wondrous than our imagination. The diversity of alien worlds has surprised us and challenged our preconceptions many times over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is quite a change from merely 20 years ago, when we knew for sure of just one planetary system: ours. The pace of discovery, supported by new instruments and missions and innovative strategies by planet seekers, has been astounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, from measurements of their masses and sizes, we can infer what some of these worlds are made of: gases, ice or rocks. Astronomers have been able to take the temperature of planets around other stars, first with telescopes in space but more recently with ground-based instruments, as my collaborators and I have done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two and a half years ago, we even managed to capture the first direct pictures of alien worlds. There is something about a photo of an alien planet -- even if it only appears as a faint dot next to a bright, overexposed star -- that makes it ''real.'' Given that stars shine like floodlights next to the planetary embers huddled around them, success required painstaking efforts and clever innovations. One essential tool is adaptive optics technology, which, in effect, takes the twinkle out of the stars, thus providing sharper images from telescopes on the ground than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the crux of this grand pursuit is one basic question: Is our warm, wet, rocky world, teeming with life, the exception or the norm? It is an important question for every one of us, not just for scientists. It seems absurd, if not arrogant, to think that ours is the only life-bearing world in the galaxy, given hundreds of billions of other suns, the apparent ubiquity of planets, and the cosmic abundance of life's ingredients. It may be that life is fairly common, but that ''intelligent'' life is rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the vast majority of the extra-solar worlds discovered to date are quite unlike our own: many are gas giants, and some are boiling hot while others endure everlasting chills. Just a handful are close in size to our planet, and only a few of those may be rocky like the Earth, rather than gaseous like Jupiter or icy like Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within the next few years, astronomers expect to find dozens of alien earths that are roughly the size of our planet. Some of them will likely be in the so-called habitable zone, where the temperatures are just right for liquid water. The discovery of ''Earth twins,'' with conditions similar to what we find here, will inevitably bring questions about alien life to the forefront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detecting signs of life elsewhere will not be easy, but it may well occur in my lifetime, if not during the next decade. Given the daunting distances between the stars, the real-life version will almost certainly be a lot less sensational than the movies depicting alien invasions or crash-landing spaceships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence may be circumstantial at first -- say, spectral bar codes of interesting molecules like oxygen, ozone, methane and water -- and leave room for alternative interpretations. It may take years of additional data-gathering, and perhaps the construction of new telescopes, to satisfy our doubts. Besides, we won't know whether such ''biosignatures'' are an indication of slime or civilization. Most people will likely move on to other, more immediate concerns of life here on Earth while scientists get down to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, on the other hand, an alien radio signal were to be detected, that would constitute a more clear-cut and exciting moment. Even if the contents of the message remained elusive for decades, we would know that there was someone ''intelligent'' at the other end. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence with radio telescopes has come of age recently, 50 years after the first feeble attempt. The construction of the Allen Telescope Array on an arid plateau in northern California greatly expands the number of star systems from which astronomers could detect signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However it arrives, the first definitive evidence of life elsewhere will mark a turning point in our intellectual history, perhaps only rivaled by Copernicus's heliocentric theory or Darwin's theory of evolution. If life can spring up on two planets independently, why not on a thousand or even a billion others? The ramifications of finding out for sure that ours isn't the only inhabited world are likely to be felt, over time, in many areas of human thought and endeavor -- from biology and philosophy to religion and art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people worry that discovering life elsewhere, especially if it turns out to be in possession of incredible technology, will make us feel small and insignificant. They seem concerned that it will constitute a horrific blow to our collective ego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I happen to be an optimist. It may take decades after the initial indications of alien life for scientists to gather enough evidence to be certain or to decipher a signal of artificial origin. The full ramifications of the discovery may not be felt for generations, giving us plenty of time to get used to the presence of our galactic neighbors. Besides, knowing that we are not alone just might be the kick in the pants we need to grow up as a species.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before the launch, the chief Soviet spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev came on the link. ''Yuri Alexeyevich, how are you hearing me? I need to tell you something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Receiving you loud and clear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just want to remind you that after the one-minute readiness is announced, there'll be about six minutes before you actually take off, so don't worry about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I read you. I'm absolutely not worried.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There'll be six minutes for all sorts of things, you know.'' He meant that a minor instrument problem had created a six-minute delay in the launch sequence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the cosmonaut Pavel Popovich came on the line. ''Hey, can you guess who's this talking to you?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure, it's 'Lily of the Valley!'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yuri, are you getting bored in there?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there was some music, I could stand it a little better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerned for every last detail of the flight, Korolev took care of this personally, ordering his technicians to find some tapes or records and set something up straight away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Haven't they given you some music yet?'' he asked a few minutes later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing so far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Damned musicians. They dither about and the whole thing is sooner said than done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, now they've done it. They've put on a love song.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Good choice, I'd say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8:41 a.m. Gagarin felt the shudder of distant valves slamming shut, the rocket swaying as the fuel lines were pulled away. ''Yuri, we're going down to the control bunker now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8:51 a.m. The music stopped. Korolev's deep, stern voice on the link, all seriousness now.''Yuri, the 15-minute mark.'' This was the signal for Gagarin to seal his gloves and swing down the transparent visor on his helmet. In these last minutes before liftoff there was no NASA-style 5-4-3-2-1 ''countdown'' on the public-address system (and no public-address system). The rocket would be fired at the appointed instant: 9:06 a.m., Moscow time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Launch key to 'go' position.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Air purging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Idle run.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ignition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All kinds of vibrations now, high whinings and low rumbles. At some point Gagarin knew he must have lifted off, but the exact moment was elusive, identified with precision only by the electrical relays of the gantry's hold-down arms as they moved aside, the four clamps disconnecting from the rocket's flanks within a single hundredth of a second of each other. Gagarin lay rigid in his seat and tensed his muscles. At any moment something could go wrong with the booster, the hatch above his head might fly away, and his ejection charges would punch him out into the morning sky like a bullet. This ''life-saving'' jolt might kill him - crunch his spine; snap his neck like a chicken's; the hatchway's rim might snag his knees and tear them right off. He had to be prepared. The G-load climbing. No emergency ejection yet. ...He didn't remember it later, but they told him he shouted out, ''Poyekhali!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's go!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T-plus 70.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I read you, 70. I feel excellent. Continuing the flight. G-load increasing. All is well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''T-plus 100. How do you feel?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel fine. How about you?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two minutes into the flight Gagarin was finding it a little hard to speak into his radio microphone. The G-forces were pulling at his face muscles. There was a strange moment when all the weight lifted and he was thrown violently forward against his straps. A shudder told him that the rocket's four side-slung boosters were falling away. It paused in its acceleration, as if taking a big breath before the final spurt. Then the central core picked up the pace and the sensation of great weight returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five minutes up. Another jolt as the exhausted central core was dropped. Millions of rubles' worth of complex machinery was tossed aside without a second thought, like a spent match flicked to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine minutes after he had left the pad, Gagarin was in orbit. The vibrations ceased, yet there was no particular sensation of silence. Only those who have never traveled into orbit are in the habit of describing ''the eerie silence of outer space.'' The ship was noisy with air fans, ventilators, pumps and valves for the life-support system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a porthole Gagarin saw a sudden shock of blue, a blue more intense than he had ever seen. The earth passed across one porthole and drifted upward out of sight, then reappeared in another porthole on the other side of the ball before drifting downward out of sight. The sky was intensely black now. Gagarin tried to see the stars, but the television lamp in the cabin was glaring directly into his eyes. Suddenly the sun appeared in one of the portholes, blindingly bright. Then the earth again - the horizon not straight but curving like a big ball's, with its layer of atmospheric haze so incredibly thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traveling eastward, ever eastward, flying at eight kilometers per second, the dials indicated: 28,000 kmph, although Gagarin would not have experienced any sense of speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How are you feeling?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The flight continues well. The machine is functioning normally. Reception excellent. Am carrying out observations of the earth. Visibility good. I can see the clouds. I can see everything. It's beautiful!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September 1961: A Bad Landing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crimea is almost an island. It juts out into the Black Sea, connected to Ukraine by two peninsulas as delicate as veins. The northernmost territories of the island are pleasant but dull. The south is a different matter. There are beautiful mountains, sun-dappled forests, sheltered beaches speckled with palms. The weather is still fine in October, and the almond trees are back in bloom by February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 1960s heyday, the Tesseli dacha at Foros was a luxury sanitarium complex designed to accommodate only the most privileged group bookings. Warm seas, fresh meat and fruit, fine wines, perhaps a certain freedom from everyday restraints: all of these pleasures were available, and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call her ''Anna''; perhaps there were two Annas. Anna Rumanseyeva, a young nurse, was on duty at Tesseli on Sept. 14, 1961, when Gagarin and his cosmonaut comrades came to stay. She speaks with intimate knowledge of another nurse called Anna, also working at Foros when Gagarin came to stay. Maybe the two Annas are one and the same person? It is not important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some people in life, especially men, who are constantly looking for adventure,'' she says. ''I would say Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin was this kind of person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yuri and his wife, Valentina, arrived at the sanitarium with their second daughter, Galya, 6 months old and still in need of her mother's constant attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagarin seemed desperate for distraction. In the second week, he took some of his companions out to sea in a small motorboat. The Foros staff pleaded with him: it was against the rules, he did not know the local conditions, the wind was offshore, the weather could be difficult, he should not go. But he went anyway, taking the boat far from shore and driving it recklessly, making tight turns to splash his passengers with spray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swell picked up, just as he had been warned. The boat was carried over the horizon and out of sight of the shore, and a larger motorboat had to be sent out to make a rescue. When they hauled him back ashore, Gagarin went to the medical station for assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rough conditions he had turned the boat's steering wheel so hard that his hands were bloodied and cracked. But the pain, and the unpleasantness of his foolish adventure, did not entirely divert his attention from the pretty blond-haired nurse who attended to his blisters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Rumanseyeva recalls a party held the next day, in which Gagarin, his wife and the other ''Anna'' were present: '' 'Anna' said she went into a room and sat on a sofa. Yuri Alexeyevich - I don't know what was on his mind. He was drunk. Perhaps he wanted to talk? I don't think he had any other thoughts. Anyway, he went into the room. He closed the door but didn't lock it with a key. Valentina Ivanovna went into the room immediately after him.''--</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know, his wife Valentina was quite a complicated woman,'' says the Soviet space journalist Yaroslav Golovanov. ''She protected Yuri from every kind of temptation which came as a result of his position. . . . Anyway, Valentina discovered that the First Cosmonaut had disappeared, and she decided to find out where he was, and he showed the true colors of goodness and of a gentleman. He showed genuine nobility and jumped out of a window on the second floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both women leaned over the balcony's edge to take a look and saw Gagarin sprawled on the ground, motionless. ''At that time, there were wild grapes growing on the balconies,'' Anna Rumanseyeva explains. ''They may have caught him as he jumped. He hit a curbstone with his forehead. It was not a good landing. On his return from space he landed successfully. Here, unsuccessfully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they took him inside, where the doctors applied local anesthetic to his brow. Some of the bone in his forehead was chipped. When the surgeons arrived, they cleared out the fragments, effected temporary repairs and stitched the wound. Gagarin held someone's hand throughout. He made no sound whatsoever, but his nails left livid marks, so tight was his grip. The enormity of Gagarin's blunder seemed to catch up with him. He looked up at the nurse Anna for a moment, and she remembers him asking her just one question. ''Will I fly again?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April 1967: Falling to Earth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the spring of 1967, development of the Soyuz spacecraft, which was intended to eventually put a Soviet man on the moon, was moving toward that crucial first flight. On April 22, the Soviet propaganda departments felt confident enough to let slip some rumors to the international press agency UPI. ''The upcoming mission will include the most spectacular Soviet space venture in history - an attempted in-flight hookup between two ships and a transfer of crews.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cosmonaut Alexei Leonov says, ''The first manned test of the Soyuz was assigned to Vladimir Komarov, with Yuri Gagarin as the backup, and another Soyuz spacecraft was being prepared for Yuri to fly at a later date.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Komarov's launch was supposed to be followed a day later by another Soyuz with three more crewmen aboard. It seems likely that the Brezhnev administration wanted the docking to take place on or around May Day. The year 1967 had a special significance in the Communist calendar; it was the 50th anniversary of the 1917 revolution. The concept of making a ''union'' between two spaceships collaborating in orbit was highly symbolic, especially for a ruling government obsessed with symbols.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the deadline for the mission drew near, technicians knew of 203 separate faults in the spacecraft that still required attention. Yuri Gagarin was closely involved in this assessment. By March 9, 1967, he and his closest cosmonaut colleagues had produced a formal 10-page document, with the help of the engineers, in which all the problems were outlined in detail. The trouble was, no one knew what to do with it. Within Soviet society, bad news always reflected badly on the messenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many as 50 senior engineers knew about the report, but none of them felt sufficiently confident to go into the Kremlin and do what had to be done: request that Leonid Brezhnev play down the symbolism of the pending launch, so as to allow a decent delay for technical improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cosmonauts and bureaucrats eventually adopted an age-old technique. They recruited a nonpartisan messenger from outside the Soyuz program to deliver the document for them: Yuri Gagarin's K.G.B. friend Venyamin Russayev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Komarov invited me and my wife to visit his family,'' says Russayev. ''Afterward, as he was seeing us off, 'Komarov said straight out, 'I'm not going to make it back from this flight.' As I knew the state of affairs, I asked him, 'If you're so convinced you're going to die, then why don't you refuse the mission?' He answered, 'If I don't make this flight, they'll send the backup pilot instead. That's Yura, and he'll die instead of me. We've got to take care of him.' . . . Komarov said he knew what he was talking about, and he burst into such bitter tears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russayev could not be of much help on his own. Back at his desk in the Lubyanka the next morning, after a sleepless night, he decided to ask advice from one of his K.G.B. seniors, Major-General Konstantin Makharov, a man he respected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I went to Makharov's office and told him there was a serious problem with the rocket. He listened to me very carefully, and then he said, 'I'm going to do something. In the meantime don't leave your desk today. Not even for one second.' I kept my promise, and I'd only been back at my desk for a short while when he sent for me again. He gave me a letter, prepared by a team mobilized by Yuri Gagarin. Most of the cosmonauts took part in the research. Makharov told me to take the letter upstairs and see Ivan Fadyekin, head of Department Three.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ''letter'' consisted of a 10-page document describing all 203 problems in the Soyuz hardware. As soon as he saw it, Fadyekin dodged the responsibility straight away. ''I don't have the expertise for this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He redirected Russayev to a much more dangerous man in the Lubyanka: Georgi Tsinev. Tsinev was a close personal friend of Leonid Brezhnev; in fact, he was related by marriage, and they had fought alongside each other in the war. If anyone could deliver an important message straight into the hands of the First Secretary, Tsinev could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for Russayev, things were not quite that simple. Tsinev was rising fast within the K.G.B., helped along by his powerful patron in the Kremlin. He was not going to allow any irritations to disturb that cozy relationship. ''While reading the letter, Tsinev looked at me, gauging my reactions to see if I'd read it or not,'' Russayev explains. ''He was glaring at me very intently, watching me like a hawk, and suddenly he asked, 'How would you like a promotion up to my department?' He even offered me a better office.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tsinev kept hold of the document, and it was never seen again. Within weeks, Fadyekin was transferred to a junior consular office in Iran, merely for the crime of glancing through it. Makharov was fired immediately, without a pension, and Tsinev took over as chief of an entire counterintelligence department. Russayev was stripped of any responsibility for space affairs and transferred to an insignificant staff training department outside Moscow, well away from the Lubyanka. ''I kept my head down like a hermit for the next 10 years,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April 23, 1967: Crash and Burn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on the morning of April 23, 1967, the Soyuz was propped up against the gantry at the Soviet launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, according to the original schedule. The journalist Golovanov noticed Gagarin behaving very strangely. ''He demanded to be put into the protective spacesuit. It was already clear that Komarov was perfectly fit to fly, and there were only three or four hours remaining until liftoff time, but he suddenly burst out and started demanding this and that. It was a sudden caprice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russayev and others insist that Gagarin was trying to elbow his way onto the flight in order to save Komarov from almost certain death. Rumors about the dialogue between Komarov and ground control have circulated for many years, based on reports from the National Security Agency staff monitoring the radio signals from an Air Force facility near Istanbul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 1972 a former NSA analyst, interviewed under the name Winslow Peck (real name Perry Fellwock), gave a very moving account of the interception: ''[The Soviet premier Alexei] Kosygin called Komarov personally. They had a videophone conversation, and Kosygin was crying. He told him he was a hero. . . . The guy's wife got on too. He told her how to handle their affairs and what to do with the kids.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he began his descent into the atmosphere, Komarov knew he was in terrible trouble. The radio outposts in Turkey picked up his cries of rage as he plunged to his death, cursing the people who had put him inside a botched spaceship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parachutes did not deploy properly. A small drogue canopy came out but failed to pull the bigger canopy from its storage bay. A backup parachute was released, only to become entangled with the first drogue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Komarov slammed onto the steppe near Orenburg with all the force of an unrestrained 2.8-ton meteorite. The capsule was utterly flattened, and the buffer retro rockets in its base blew up on impact, burning what little wreckage was left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovery troops picked up handfuls of soil to try and dampen the flames. Their radio messages back to base were garbled and distressed: something about the cosmonaut ''requiring urgent medical attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russayev says a heel bone was found among the ashes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks after Komarov's death, Gagarin met Russayev at his family apartment but refused to speak in any of the rooms because he was worried about bugs. The lifts and lobby areas were not safe, either, so the two men trudged up and down the apartment block's echoing stairwells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gagarin of 1967 was very different from the carefree young man of 1961. Komarov's death had placed an enormous burden of guilt on his shoulders. At one point Gagarin said, ''I must go to see the main man [Brezhnev] personally.'' He was profoundly depressed that he hadn't been able to persuade Brezhnev to cancel Komarov's launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before Gagarin left, the intensity of his anger became obvious. ''I'll get through to him [Brezhnev] somehow, and if I ever find out he knew about the situation and still let everything happen, then I know exactly what I'm going to do.'' Russayev goes on, ''I don't know exactly what Yuri had in mind. Maybe a good punch in the face.' '' Russayev warned Gagarin to be cautious as far as Brezhnev was concerned. ''I told him, 'Talk to me first before you do anything. I warn you, be very careful.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One story has it that Gagarin caught up with Brezhnev eventually and threw a drink in his face.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The shuttle Discovery braved the hellish fire of re-entry for the last time Wednesday and glided back to Earth to close out the space plane's 39th and final voyage, an emotion-charged milestone marking the beginning of the end for America's shuttle program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dropping through a partly cloudy sky, the commander, Steven W. Lindsey, and Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force guided Discovery through a sweeping left overhead turn, lined up on Runway 15 and floated to a picture-perfect touchdown at 11:57 a.m. Eastern time to wrap up an extended 13-day space station assembly mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it coasted to a stop under a brilliant noon sun, Discovery had logged some 5,750 orbits covering nearly 150 million miles during 39 flights spanning a full year in space -- a record unrivaled in the history of manned rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And Houston, Discovery, for the final time, wheels stopped,'' Mr. Lindsey radioed flight controllers in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery, Houston, great job by you and your crew,'' replied Charles Hobaugh, an astronaut in mission control. ''That was a great landing in tough conditions, and it was an awesome docked mission you all had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lindsey and Colonel Boe were joined aboard Discovery by Benjamin Alvin Drew Jr.; Nicole P. Stott; Michael R. Barratt, a physician-astronaut; and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen of the Navy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As support crews swarmed onto the broad runway, engineers in the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building were busy preparing the shuttle Endeavour for rollout. The target date for Endeavour's 25th and final flight is April 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's remaining orbiter, the Atlantis, is scheduled for liftoff June 28 on the shuttle program's 135th flight, the final chapter in a post-Apollo initiative that produced what is arguably the most complex, capable and costly manned rockets ever built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a program come to a close here, and to see these shuttles, these beautiful, magnificent flying machines, end their service life is obviously a little bit sad for us,'' Dr. Barratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But it is about time -- they've lived a very long time, they've had a fabulous success record,'' he added. ''We look forward to seeing them retire with dignity and bringing on the next line of spaceships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sort of spaceship might ultimately replace the shuttle is an open question, and it is not yet clear how NASA will fare in the budget debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But between Atlantis's landing this summer and the debut of whatever vehicle replaces it -- several years from now at best -- the only way for American astronauts to reach orbit will be to hitch rides aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft at $55 million a seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a bitter pill for the thousands of men and women who have worked on the shuttle fleet over the past three decades, who now face layoffs and the prospect of seeing Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis -- the world's most sophisticated spacecraft -- turned into museum displays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We won't do anything nearly as complex with another vehicle for a very long time,'' Mr. Drew said. ''Five or 10 years from now, they're going to look back and say 'How did we ever build a vehicle that could do all these things?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, does anyone want to buy a used space shuttle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it turns out. This old vehicle -- the space shuttle Discovery -- is an object of fervent desire for museums around the country, which would love to add it or one of its mates, the Endeavour and the Atlantis, to their collections. (Financing terms can be arranged with NASA.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is to return from orbit on Wednesday, concluding its 39th flight and its space-faring career, but it will make at least one more ascent -- piggyback on a 747 airplane -- to its resting place for public display. NASA will announce the final destinations for the three soon-to-be-retired shuttles on April 12, the 30th anniversary of the first space shuttle launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the competing institutions have been campaigning energetically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visitor center at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston hired a marketing firm and set up a Web site, bringtheshuttlehome.com. Houston, the marketers argue, is the location of NASA's Mission Control, which guides the shuttles during flight. For the Texans, owning a space shuttle would be ''the modern-day equivalent of housing Columbus' famed ships -- the Nina, the Pinta or the Santa Maria,'' the Web site states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan has collected more than 150,000 names on a petition urging that one of the shuttles be placed there. ''New York City would make an ideal home for one of these retiring shuttles,'' the campaign asserts, noting that the spacecraft would be ''prominently displayed'' on Pier 86 in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Museum of Flight in Seattle has perhaps gone the furthest: this week, it erected the first wall of a new $12 million wing to house the shuttle it may never get. The museum's ''shuttle boosters'' Web site argues that Seattle has ''the right stuff'' because the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 747 was built there and 27 shuttle astronauts have called Washington home. (Officials at the Seattle museum say they have planned for the possibility of not getting a shuttle and would fill the space with other space artifacts.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one knows if these efforts, or dueling letters from various members of Congress, are exerting any sway on the top decision-maker at NASA, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who has said that he alone will decide where the shuttles end up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA says that 21 institutions have submitted proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're waiting,'' said Susan Marenoff, president of the Intrepid Museum. ''We're hoping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other hopefuls include the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the launching site of all of the shuttle missions; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; and the Museum of the United States Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio, which got a boost from President Obama's budget request for 2012 seeking $14 million to send a shuttle there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are more favorites than there are shuttles,'' said Robert Pearlman, editor of CollectSpace.com, a Web site for space history enthusiasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One museum that has been mum is the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. But that is because NASA already offered it the Discovery three years ago, and most expect the Discovery will go there. After concerns last year that the Smithsonian could not afford $28.8 million, Congress, in a budget bill passed in December, included a clause that specifically excuses the Smithsonian from those costs. If NASA offered a shuttle to the Smithsonian, the bill decreed, it would be ''at no or nominal cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Smithsonian, however, has been reticent about its intentions, and a spokeswoman offered only a short statement: ''The museum is involved in discussions with NASA about transfer of the orbiter and other artifacts from the shuttle program. The final disposition of shuttle artifacts will be the decision of NASA.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Discovery lands, only two shuttle flights remain. The Endeavour is scheduled to launch in April, and the Atlantis in June. Then the three will become museum pieces, with delivery expected next year. Each weighs about 170,000 pounds and is 122 feet long, with a wingspan of 78 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a fourth orbiter, the Enterprise, which was used for early glide tests but never went to space. The Air and Space Museum has the Enterprise on display at its spacious Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington-Dulles Airport. If the Discovery goes to the Smithsonian as expected, the Enterprise would likely get bumped to a new home, a consolation prize for one of the museums that did not receive a space-traveled shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, NASA inquired if any museums or other institutions had an interest in acquiring one of the three flying space shuttles. Potential bidders were told that educational programs had to accompany the exhibits, and that the shuttles had to reside in an indoor, climate-controlled environment. (NASA does not want to repeat the mistake at the end of the Apollo era, when the remaining Saturn V rockets rusted and decayed outdoors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, NASA has been mostly silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've not been contacted since we submitted,'' said Richard E. Allen Jr., chief executive of Space Center Houston, the visitor center at Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After it lands, the Discovery will go through a month of postflight rituals, like the removal of payloads. But then, instead of beginning preparations for another flight, workers will start primping it for its life as a tourist attraction. That work -- which accounts for most of the $28.8 million that NASA is charging -- will include cleaning or removing parts that have been contaminated by toxic propellants, and will likely take nine months to a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visitor complex at the Kennedy Space Center has proposed what would probably the most ambitious display: While most of the museums would have the orbiter sitting on the ground and build a fancy hangar around it, Kennedy would like to suspend it horizontally as if it were in Earth's orbit, with the payload doors open and the robotic arm sticking out. It would the centerpiece of a $100 million, 64,000-square-foot exhibit that would open in the second half of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to show it in flight,'' said William Moore, the chief operating officer of the visitor center, which operates under contract with NASA without government funding, ''and so the exhibit is really based around the shuttle working, because it's a working vehicle and has done a lot of great things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore said he was confident that his institution would be one of the recipients. ''You should be sure to call me back on April the 13th about how we feel when we get an orbiter,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, for all his confidence, Mr. Moore admitted that he had no idea what General Bolden was thinking. ''We read the newspaper a lot,'' he said. ''NASA has been very close-lipped about this. We really don't have any inside scoop at all.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, within a couple of years, tourists will be rocketing into space aboard a Virgin Galactic space plane -- paying $200,000 for about four minutes of weightlessness -- before coming back down for a landing on a New Mexico runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in the next seat could be a scientist working on a research experiment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science, perhaps even more than tourism, could turn out to be big business for Virgin and other companies that are aiming to provide short rides above the 62-mile altitude that marks the official entry into outer space, eventually on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $200,000 ticket is prohibitively expensive except for a small slice of the wealthy, but compared with the millions of dollars that government agencies like NASA typically spend to get experiments into space, ''it's revolutionary,'' said S. Alan Stern, an associate vice president of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s space sciences and engineering division in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is a spirited evangelist for the science possibilities of what is known in aerospace circles as suborbital travel. Just as important as the lower cost, scientists will be able to get their experiments to space more quickly and more often, Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're really at the edge of something transformational,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern's institute announced Monday that it has signed a contract and paid the deposit to send two of its scientists up in Virgin's SpaceShipTwo vehicle. Southwest also intends to buy six more seats -- $1.6 million in tickets over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That follows an announcement on Thursday that Southwest is buying six seats from another suborbital company, <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> of Mojave, Calif., which has been charging $95,000 a seat for tourists. XCOR's Lynx space plane carries just two people -- the pilot and the paying passenger -- so each flight will carry an experiment and an institute scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have built, on our own dime, three payloads,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We're buying tickets, before there is a government program from suborbital providers, for our own people to fly with those experiments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the Southwest experiments will look at how loose soil and rocks like those that cover asteroids behave. Another will fly an ultraviolet telescope that flew on the space shuttle Discovery in 1997. The third is a biomedical harness to measure heartbeat, blood pressure and other physical parameters of the scientist during flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the experiments will get to space has not been set. Neither company has yet announced when commercial flights will begin, but eventually SpaceShipTwo could fly once or twice a day, and the Lynx is designed for up to four flights a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin has already performed unpowered glide tests for the six-passenger SpaceShipTwo at Spaceport America in New Mexico and will begin powered ones soon. XCOR may begin flight tests of the Lynx later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other companies -- Blue Origin, created by Jeff Bezos, founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, and Armadillo Aerospace -- are also developing spacecraft for the tourist business. Another company, Masten Space Systems Inc., is developing a suborbital vehicle that will carry only payloads, not people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if only some of these companies succeed, the prospect is that in a few years, hundreds of suborbital flights could be taking off every year. Dr. Stern predicted that even though a single flight would offer only a few minutes of weightlessness, the cumulative time of the suborbital experiments could quickly overtake that of the International Space Station, which has been in orbit for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will be flying automated scientific payloads on Masten and Armadillo rockets this year, and the agency will provide more opportunities for researchers in future years, although it has not offered to buy seats for people to accompany their experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists, that could finally provide them ready access to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's almost impossible to get research on the space station at the moment,'' said Mark Shelhamer, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University medical school who would like to study people's balance and other motor sensory abilities before and after suborbital flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, gravity is the dominant force, and many common processes -- the way that water boils, for instance, and that a flame burns -- behave much differently without it. But many of the theories describing how physics should work in weightlessness have not been tested in detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists currently have a few options for investigating weightlessness. They can drop the experiment from a tall tower, which provides a couple of seconds of zero gravity before it goes splat on the ground. They can send the experiment up in an airplane that flies an arcing trajectory known as a parabola, which provides up to half a minute of apparent weightlessness. Or they can get something to the International Space Station, where the pull of gravity is continuously absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suborbital flights will offer an opportunity that falls between the parabolic plane flights and the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new commercial vehicles are essentially rocket-powered projectiles that arc upward and then fall back down, never coming close to the 17,500-miles-per-hour velocity needed to achieve orbit. At the top of the arc, passengers float for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suborbital flights will also let atmospheric scientists explore in detail the Earth's middle atmosphere, extending from about 30 to 50 miles above the surface, which cannot be easily observed from Earth or satellites. Biologists also hope to study how people, who rely on gravity to tell which way is up, respond to the rapid gyrations of gravity during a suborbital flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting the interest in the science community, more than 300 people are registered to attend a conference this week at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, organized by Dr. Stern, to discuss suborbital research. Researchers, Dr. Stern said, ''vote with their feet. They go to these meetings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the conference, the suborbital companies will provide updates on their progress, and scientists will talk about what types of research will be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> is the first paying science customer for Virgin, which already has deposits from more than 400 would-be space tourists. George T. Whitesides, chief executive, said that science and technology development could turn into a big market. ''We think that many new applications and studies will flourish with such access -- access which does not exist today,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitesides said that the science experiments would generally fly separately from the tourists, although it might be possible for researchers with unobtrusive biology experiments to ride on a tourist flight. ''We would of course not mix the two categories on the same flight if we thought that one would negatively impact the other,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the experiments require the scientist as passenger. Blue Origin, for example, has selected three scientific payloads that will fly on unmanned test flights of its New Shepard vehicle. One of the Blue Origin scientists is Joshua Colwell, a professor of physics at the University of Central Florida, who wants to understand how dust grains in the early solar system stuck together through low-speed collisions and grew in size to five-mile-wide planetesimals, which then combined into planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Dr. Colwell applied to NASA to fly his experiment on the space shuttle, and it flew twice, in 1998 and 2001, but he has not been able to get follow-up research off the ground since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Colwell's experiments, which require only a few minutes of weightlessness, the suborbital flights would work just as well as a much more expensive shuttle flight. And he hopes to be able to fly them perhaps several times a year instead of once every several years. Blue Origin declined to say when the test flights might occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another of the Blue Origin researchers, Steven H. Collicott of Purdue University, is looking at how surface tension -- the force that causes raindrops to roll up into beads on leaves -- pulls liquids in space. Without gravity, these so-called capillary effects are the dominant forces on liquids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Collicott, who has collaborated on experiments on the space station, said the suborbital flights will be a complement to the station, not a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that first off, they really are two vastly different opportunities,'' he said. On the station, ''the ability of running an experiment hour after hour after hour is the ultimate. On these new suborbital rockets, we might get three minutes, but it's a lot cheaper. It's a lot quicker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his Blue Origin experiment, financed by the National Science Foundation, cost $20,000. He has also has a couple of smaller, shoebox-size experiments built by undergraduates for less than $1,000. Those are slated to fly on developmental flights by Masten and Armadillo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a nice, really great addition to the facilities available for research,'' Dr. Collicott said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countdown proceeded smoothly into its final hour, but trouble with an Air Force tracking system computer threw the outcome into doubt. With the countdown holding at the five-minute mark, the Air Force reported a successful repair. The countdown resumed, and Discovery blasted off at 4:53:24 p.m. Eastern time -- three seconds before the end of the day's launching window.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery put on a spectacular show for area residents and tourists, who crowded nearby roads and beaches to witness the shuttle's final climb to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flight controllers were paying close attention to the view from a camera mounted on the side of the shuttle's external tank, on the lookout for any signs of foam insulation falling away that could pose a threat to the ship's fragile heat shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extensive foam work was done as part of repairs to fix cracks in the external tank that forced NASA to ground the shuttle after the scrubbing of a planned Nov. 5 launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the climb on Thursday, several large pieces of debris could be seen falling from the tank, some striking the shuttle's heat shield, but the shedding appeared to occur well after the shuttle was out of the dense lower atmosphere, where debris impacts can cause the most damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No obvious impact damage could be seen in the downlink television views, but a detailed analysis will be carried out over the next few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the shuttle is on track for a docking with the International Space Station around 2:15 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery's a great ship,'' Michael Leinbach, the launch director, told reporters Wednesday. ''This is her 39th mission; we'd have quite a few left in her had the program been extended.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On board Discovery are five men and one woman: strapped into seats on the upper flight deck are the commander, Steven W. Lindsey; Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force, the pilot; Capt. Benjamin Alvin Drew Jr. of the Air Force; and Nicole P. Stott, the flight engineer. On the ship's lower deck are Michael R. Barratt, a physician and astronaut, and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen of the Navy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Bowen is a late addition. A veteran of five spacewalks, he was called in to replace the mission's original lead spacewalker, Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army, who was injured in a bicycle mishap last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew change was a relatively minor snag compared with the testing and analysis required to resolve questions about potentially dangerous cracks that were found after the Nov. 5 launching was called off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming an on-time docking on Saturday, Captain Drew and Captain Bowen plan two spacewalks, Monday and Wednesday. The new storage module will be attached to the station on Tuesday. The flight plan calls for Discovery to undock from the station on March 5 and land at the Kennedy Space Center on March 7.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to Spaceport America, the country's first facility built specifically for commercial space travel -- an endeavor that the state envisioned as the epicenter of a fledgling industry where tourists would pay large sums to take suborbital flights into space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, though, after years of planning and debate, New Mexico's grand ambitions for Spaceport have come down to earth, its future entwined with the state's struggling economy. Though more than 400 people have put down flight deposits totaling more than $55 million, it is still not exactly clear when the first flight will launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her first two months in office, Gov. Susana Martinez removed the Spaceport's supervising board, pushed out its executive director and began a review of the project's finances, saying the Spaceport needed more robust private investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martinez, a Republican, was elected on a promise of paring government, and the state's revenue windfall is long gone. The governor has since made a point of stating her support for the project, and this month she appointed a new board, including three former members and Sid Gutierrez, a former astronaut. But she has also vowed to privatize the Spaceport, saying taxpayers have already paid their fair share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Spaceport is part of the plan for economic development in New Mexico, and the voters made it clear they support it,'' Ms. Martinez said in a recent interview. ''We want to be a leader in space exploration, but we want to do it within our budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dream of a commercial spaceport has been around for years in New Mexico, which has long had a love affair with aerospace and aliens. Back in 2006, flush with oil and gas revenue, the Legislature, pushed by Gov. Bill Richardson, approved $132 million to build the Spaceport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing to reap the benefits if the project succeeds, voters in Dona Ana and Sierra Counties passed a quarter-cent sales tax, which will provide the remaining money needed for construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New Mexico has since taken on a $450 million deficit. The ambitious project was budgeted at about $209 million, but a second runway could be needed to expand commercial operations. Ms. Martinez has made it clear she wants any additional financing for the Spaceport to come from private industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's going to be our big push right now,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the project say the Spaceport could create hundreds of jobs and draw wealthy tourists. But some here question the new governor's commitment to see it through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's face it -- privatizing the Spaceport means selling it off and trying to remove any risk to the state,'' said Rick Homans, who was appointed by Mr. Richardson as the facility's executive director until Ms. Martinez asked him to step down. ''The message would be that the state is not committed long term, and the new industry will look at other states where they can find a fully engaged partner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Mexico is not the only entity heavily invested. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has signed on to be the facility's anchor tenant for 20 years and has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars toward developing the technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, amid considerable fanfare, Virgin began taking reservations for spaceflights -- a ticket costs $200,000. Construction of the 110,000-square-foot hangar and terminal is nearing completion. Virgin Galactic's chief executive and president, George Whitesides, said in a recent interview that the company expected to launch commercial flights within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its engineers are working to finish the rocket engine that will power the small spaceship, Mr. Whitesides said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin estimates each flight will take roughly two and a half hours -- including four minutes in actual space and the iconic view of Earth from outside its atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitesides predicted that the spectacle of the rich and famous being rocketed into space will lure much needed work here, and Virgin is looking at building a luxury hotel nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, the state's economy has changed. That said, most of the money has either already been allocated or spent on the project,'' said Mr. Whitesides, a former chief of staff for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''I really do think this is a case where the investment has been made, and a relatively small expenditure will open the possibility for tremendous growth in New Mexico.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nearby Truth or Consequences, a quirky art town named for the long-running game show, residents have mixed, though curious, thoughts about space travel in their backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm for the Spaceport,'' said Cherrill Sullivan, who owns a western clothing shop here. ''We need jobs bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A local hair stylist, Susan Kopet, shook her head at the notion of the Spaceport's providing an economic boon for the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I pay taxes on it, but I don't have the money to go up in space,'' Ms. Kopet said. ''I can think of a lot better ways to spend millions of dollars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former Spaceport board member, D. Kent Evans, a supporter of Ms. Martinez, finds himself reassuring locals about the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just want it to be successful,'' Mr. Evans said. ''I tell people this is going to be one of the best decisions they ever made.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darwin speculated that life began in a warm pond on the primordial Earth. Lately other scientists have suggested that the magic joining of molecules that could go on replicating might have happened in an undersea hot spring, on another planet or inside an asteroid. Some astronomers wonder if it could be happening right now underneath the ice of Europa or in the methane seas of Titan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two dozen chemists, geologists, biologists, planetary scientists and physicists gathered here recently to ponder where and what Eden might have been. Over a long weekend they plastered the screen in their conference room with intricate chemical diagrams through which electrons bounced in a series of interactions like marbles rattling up and down and over bridges through one of those child's toys, transferring energy, taking care of the business of nascent life. The names of elements and molecules tripped off chemists' tongues as if they were the eccentric relatives who show up at Thanksgiving every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They charted the fall of meteorites and the rise of oxygen on the early Earth and evidence in old rocks that life was here as long as 3.5 billion years ago. The planet is only a billion years older, but estimates vary on when it became habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In front of a 2,400-member audience one night they debated the definition of life -- ''anything highly statistically improbable, but in a particular direction,'' in the words of Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist at Oxford. Or, they wondered if it could be defined at all in the absence of a second example to the Earth's biosphere -- a web of interdependence all based on DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence the quest for extraterrestrial examples is more than a sentimental use of NASA's dollars. ''Let's go look for it,'' said Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., who is involved with the Mars Science Laboratory, which will be launched in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid appearance of complex life in some accounts -- ''like Athena springing from the head of Zeus,'' in the words of Dr. McKay -- has rekindled interest recently in a theory fancied by Francis Crick, one of the discoverers of the double helix, that life originated elsewhere and floated here through space. These days the favorite candidate for such an extraterrestrial cradle is Mars, which was once a water world. Perhaps, some think, its microbes hitched a ride to Earth on asteroids -- unless, of course, the microbes went the other way and what's to be found on Mars are the dead remains of long-lost cousins of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've crashed more space probes on Mars than anywhere else -- it's that interesting,'' Dr. McKay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference was sponsored by the Origins Project at Arizona State University in an effort to get people together who don't normally talk to each other, said Lawrence Krauss, a physicist who helped organize the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk is indeed hard across disciplines and geological ages. John Sutherland, a biochemist at Cambridge University in England, said geologists and astronomers were more interested in talking and speculating about the origin of life than chemists were, even though it is basically a problem of ''nitty-gritty chemistry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason, he explained, is that ''chemists know how hard it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern version of the Garden of Eden goes by the name of RNA world, after the molecule ribonucleic acid, which plays Robin to DNA's Batman today, but is now thought have preceded it on the biological scene. RNA is more versatile, being able not only to store information, like DNA, but also to use that information to catalyze reactions, a job now performed by proteins. That solved a sort of chicken-and-egg problem about which ability came first into the world. The answer is that RNA could be both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to think of it that way, life is a very simple process,'' said Sidney Altman, who shared a Nobel Prize in 1989 for showing that RNA had these dual abilities. ''It uses energy, it sustains itself and it replicates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lesson of the meeting was how finicky are the chemical reactions needed for carrying out these simple-sounding functions. ''There might be a reason why amino acids and nucleotides are the way they are,'' Dr. Krauss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What looks complicated to us might not look so complicated to a piece of a carbon molecule awaiting integration into life's dance. ''Complexity is in the eye of the beholder,'' said Dr. Sutherland, who after 10 years of trying different recipes succeeded in synthesizing one of the four nucleotides that make up RNA in a jar in his lab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the right mixture and conditions, complicated-looking molecules can assemble themselves without help. ''When everything is in the pot,'' he said, ''the chemistry to make RNA is easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sutherland's results were hailed as a triumph for the RNA world idea, but there is much work to be done, said Steve Benner, who constructs artificial DNA at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, in Florida. Nobody knows whether Dr. Sutherland's recipe would work on the early Earth, he said. Moreover, even if RNA did appear naturally, the odds that it would happen in the right sequence to drive Darwinian evolution seem small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Other than that,'' Dr. Benner said, ''the RNA world is a great idea for origin of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some others, including astronomers and geologists, have another view of biological inevitability. Life is a natural consequence of geology, said Everett Shock, a geophysicist at Arizona State. ''Most of what life is doing is using chemical energy,'' Dr. Shock said, and that energy is available in places like undersea volcanic vents where life, he calculated, acts as a catalyst to dissipate heat from the Earth. In what he called ''a sweet deal,'' life releases energy rather than consuming it, making it easy from a thermodynamic standpoint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Biosynthesis is profitable -- it has to be; they live there,'' said Dr. Shock, referring to microbes in undersea vents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists say we won't really understand life until we can make it ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the last day of the conference, J. Craig Venter, the genome decoding entrepreneur and president of the J. Craig Venter Institute, described his adventures trying to create an organism with a computer for a parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using mail-order snippets of DNA, Dr. Venter and his colleagues stitched together the million-letter genetic code of a bacterium of a goat parasite last year and inserted it into another bacterium's cell, where it took over, churning out blue-stained copies of itself. Dr. Venter advertised his genome as the wave of future migration to the stars. Send a kit of chemicals and a digitized genome across space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll create panspermia if it didn't already exist,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new genome included what Dr. Venter called a watermark. Along with the names of the researchers were three quotations, from the author James Joyce; Robert Oppenheimer, who directed the building of the atomic bomb; and the Caltech physicist Richard Feynman: ''What I cannot build, I do not understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the news came out, last year, Dr. Venter said, the James Joyce estate called up and threatened to sue, claiming that Joyce's copyright had been violated. To date there has been no lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Caltech called up and complained that Dr. Venter's genome was misquoting Feynman. The institute sent a photograph of an old blackboard on which Feynman had written, ''What I cannot create, I do not understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so his genome is now in the process of acquiring its first, non-Darwinian mutation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stardust spacecraft, traveling 24,000 miles per hour, passed 110 miles from the comet Tempel 1 at 11:40 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. This was the first time a comet had been seen close up twice. A different NASA spacecraft, Deep Impact, visited in 2005.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you ask me, was this mission a hundred percent successful in terms of the science, I would have to say no,'' said Joseph Veverka, a professor of astronomy at Cornell and principal investigator for the mission, at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added brightly, ''It was a thousand percent successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit to Tempel 1, an extension of Stardust's original mission, cost $29 million, a fraction of the $300 million to $500 million that would be needed to send a new spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists wanted to see how parts of Tempel 1's surface seen by Deep Impact have changed, they wanted to see new swaths that Deep Impact did not take pictures of, and they wanted to see the impact crater created by an 820-pound copper slug unleashed by Deep Impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ensure that the desired parts of Tempel 1 would be facing Stardust as it passed, scientists had to precisely track the comet's rotation, and NASA had to precisely navigate the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Veverka said the orientation of Tempel 1 turned out to be within a couple of degrees of the predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the scientists had to wait to see the results. The spacecraft had been commanded to first send back five photographs taken at closest approach, but because of a software glitch, it instead sent back the images in the order they had been taken, starting with faraway ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the close-up images arrived, they covered everything on the checklist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter H. Schultz, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University and a co-investigator, said the Deep Impact crater, about 500 feet across, was ''more subdued'' than had been expected. Material that was kicked up by the collision then fell back. ''The crater partly healed itself,'' Dr. Schultz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists actually had more trouble showing the images than the spacecraft had taking them; the picture of the impact crater was left out from the presentation slides shown at the news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let me just tell them,'' Dr. Schultz said. ''We saw the crater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Veverka interjected, ''Yeah, we really did see the crater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the news conference, NASA was able to display a comparison between what Deep Impact saw five-and-a-half years ago and what Stardust saw Monday. The images can also be seen at nasa.gov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald E. Brownlee of the University of Washington, another co-investigator, described the rat-tat-tat of dust particles that hit the spacecraft. ''Like a B-17 in World War II flying through flak,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An instrument on Stardust was able to do chemical analysis on the dust particles, finding carbon and carbon-nitrogen fragments, Dr. Brownlee said.</p>

In the growing hush of full darkness, more than 9,000 stars appear, with so many gradations of intensity that binoculars can reveal more detail than the naked eye. And as I lean back in cushioned comfort, I am gradually swept off into the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the sensation offered by the newly renovated Charles Hayden Planetarium, which opened on Sunday at the Museum of Science here, after a $9 million yearlong reconstruction, its new equipment, software and 57-foot dome promising to take the next generation to the stars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to lose one's balance in the vastness of space, and over the last 15 years as planetariums around the country have revamped their systems and shows to take advantage of the latest in digital technology and the most refined fiber-optic projectors from Zeiss (the same company that outfitted the first modern planetarium in Germany in 1923), many times the moorings have come loose. The domes have been used to stage fantastical free-for-all shows of cinematic effects, including dinosaurs, cartoonish tubes of warped space and sub-woofer grumblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Boston's planetarium, whose director is David Rabkin, is remarkable, particularly in its first show, ''Undiscovered Worlds: The Search Beyond Our Sun,'' for never forgetting that we begin to make sense of the ethereal by keeping our feet on the ground. The pre-show presentation really does begin, as those at the old Hayden Planetarium in New York once did, with the local skyline lining the dome at twilight. Charles Hayden (1870-1937), a financier and philanthropist, made the New York planetarium possible with a donation; the foundation established by his will donated the money for Boston's version, which opened in 1958.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Hayden in Boston is now billed as ''the most technologically advanced digital theater in New England,'' it does not pursue thrills for their own sake, or with some exaggerated notion of what is required to lure media-sodden children into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show, instead, begins with a firm sense of place. And as it surveys the discovery of planets beyond our solar system, the old human-centered cosmos is never completely left behind: it actually motivates and guides the odyssey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, that motivation is even the subject of ''Undiscovered Worlds,'' which was written by Alan Lightman, who teaches humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with the planetarium staff. The search for other planetary systems in the cosmos is, after all, a quest for heavenly bodies that resemble our own. So in 1995, when the first planet outside our solar system is found orbiting the star 51 Pegasi, it is described as a ''monumental discovery,'' even though it is hardly a candidate for extraterrestrial life. It revolves so rapidly around its sun that its year lasts four Earth days, and its surface temperature is 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With advances in instrumentation and measurement, hundreds of other planets have been discovered since. ''We always assumed that other solar systems would resemble our own,'' we are told, as these newly found heavenly bodies, their details imagined in full color, fill the skies above our heads. We assumed ''that planets would orbit a star in tidy circles, with inner planets smaller and made of rock and outer ones larger and made of gas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were wrong,'' we learn. Almost all planets found so far have been at least as large as our Jupiter, but much closer to their suns than Mercury is to ours -- phenomena unaccounted for by contemporary theories of the solar system. And it wasn't until 2009 that a planet was discovered that, like Earth, is mostly made of rock. (Just this month The New York Times reported the possible discovery of over 1,200 smaller planets.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But held out to us is the tantalizing possibility of finding a planet that might be Earth-like enough so we can begin to imagine creatures bearing some resemblance to ourselves. We are even shown the hypothetical surface of such a planet, with lapping waves and lush plant life (their leaves black to absorb the full range of light offered in this galaxy far, far away). The entire journey, though, has been grounded in scientific principle rather than fantasy; it is careful while still being exotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium here doesn't have the advantage of a separate building (as in New York or Chicago) or an exquisite setting (as in Los Angeles), so the temptation must have been great to do something more: to create extravagant spectacles, perhaps, at least as flamboyant as the Imax theater across the museum's corridor. So the Hayden's more poised approach must have arisen out of philosophical or educational concerns, which are also reflected in the introductory exhibition leading into the planetarium, ''Cosmic Light.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It provides a basic understanding of the planets by connecting them with ordinary earthly experience. On Mars, for example, we learn, the year is 1.9 Earth years in length, that a 200-pound person would weigh just 75 pounds, and that if you drove to the Sun at 60 m.p.h., it would take 270 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More could have been done with this exhibition, but the planetarium's approach is clear: We begin to imagine the cosmos from where we stand. This is not as common an approach as it should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of a planetarium with a similar perspective is the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, which reopened after renovations in 2006. Its Art Deco building inspires a remarkable retro-sensibility in the planetarium show. A live presenter enters the dark theater holding an illuminated globe, speaking of the ''ancient mystery of the night sky'' with such appeal that later we are prepared to go outside in the evening air and look for ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something like that is possible here too. One Hayden show, ''The Sky Tonight,'' offers a human-led tour of the earthly heavens. And beginning in March the Gilliland Observatory, erected on the top level of the museum's parking lot, will have its seasonal opening; visitors will be able to use its 11-inch telescope to view some of the same phenomena shown on the planetarium's dome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a technological aspect to the Hayden's interaction between earthly perspective and cosmic speculation, as I learned from speaking with Darryl Davis, the systems coordinator for the planetarium. The Zeiss projector, which sets the standard for star configurations on domed ceilings, can only replicate the heavens as seen from Earth. In its earlier incarnations, it looked like a giant barbell; here the Zeiss Starmaster (as it is called) is egg shaped and compact, but its star displays are still geocentric. It can show the sky from different earthly locations and from different eras, but it is still our sky and only our sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way the Zeiss is pre-Copernican; it makes the Earth the center of the cosmos. Its advantage though is that it is extraordinarily precise, and can give a sense of the night sky unmatched by any other kind of projection, so subtly detailed that binoculars really can be used to discern what the eye cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But step off Earth's surface, as almost all planetarium shows now do, and the Zeiss images on the dome must give way to those of another projection system (here using Sky-Skan's DigitalSky 2 software). It draws on enormous databases of information about planets, stars and galaxies. Mr. Davis moves a cursor on a computer-screen grid and clicks on ''Go to Jupiter.'' Above, the domed sky whirls about, and we catapult through space until the planet with its famous surface storms appears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He clicks on other controls and the planet spins. We approach Jupiter's surface, map out the orbits of its moons and project their names. The stars here are not the pin pricks of precise illumination produced by the Zeiss, but are more hazy, calculated points, showing the heavens from another part of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis, comfortable navigating around the known universe, hands me the controls. I've never commanded this model starship, though, and I zoom in so fast on Saturn that I crash through it, until I learn to slide the cursor along the correct axis. I glide past the rings and go into gentle orbit, as another control speeds up the passing of time. And all the while, my feet are firmly on the ground -- a good way to begin to see the stars.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time NASA visited the Tempel 1 comet, it was with fireworks, on July 4, 2005. On that day, the Deep Impact spacecraft slammed an 820-pound projectile into Tempel 1, excavating a plume of ice and dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday night -- Valentine's Day -- NASA will return to Tempel 1 but will not bombard it. This time, a different spacecraft, Stardust, will zip past at more than 24,000 miles per hour, taking 72 high-resolution pictures of the comet's surface.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust will make its closest approach, within 125 miles, at 11:37 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Larson, the mission's project manager, said NASA was not deliberately scheduling its missions to coincide with holidays. ''That's just how the orbital mechanics worked out on these,'' he said, ''although it makes for great P.R.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tempel 1 will be the first comet to be seen at close range twice, and scientists will make a then-and-now comparison -- one that they expect will reveal a change in topography and tell them more about the inner workings of comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here's a chance where we can see what has changed, how much has changed,'' said Joseph Veverka, a professor of astronomy at Cornell and the mission's principal investigator, ''so we'll start unraveling the history of a comet's surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, photographs taken by Deep Impact in 2005 showed areas that looked old and others that seemed much younger. But the snapshots did not tell the ages of any of them. ''We have no idea whether we're talking about things that have been there for a hundred years, a thousand years, a million years,'' Dr. Veverka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five and a half years since Deep Impact's visit, Tempel 1 -- whose orbit brings it as close to the Sun as Mars and as far away as Jupiter -- has completed a full orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust was launched in 1999 and arrived five years later at its primary destination, a comet named Wild 2, where it collected particles of dust. Stardust then looped back to Earth and released a canister containing the comet dust, which parachuted back to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, still operating well, continued onward, and NASA decided to use it for a return visit to Tempel 1. (Deep Impact, meanwhile, also extended its scientific journey, visiting another comet last November.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One more puzzle that scientists may be able to solve with the second look at Tempel 1 involves depressions that look like the type of craters caused by impacts. The depressions, though, could have been caused by explosions that were a result of underground ice that converted to gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists will now be able to compare the depressions with something they know is definitely a crater -- the scar left by Deep Impact. ''Simple question,'' Dr. Veverka said, ''direct answer.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the plan of <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span> of Minneapolis -- the aerospace company more commonly known as ATK, which manufacturers the solid rocket motors for NASA's space shuttles -- and Astrium, a European company that builds Ariane 5 rockets, which are used to launch satellites. The two will announce on Tuesday what is essentially a commercial version of the Ares I, the expensive NASA rocket that Congress and the Obama administration canceled last year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I, part of a bloated NASA program to send astronauts back to the moon, could become a success story in the Obama administration's effort to shape a more affordable space program with the help of the private sector. NASA's so-called commercial crew program is seeking companies to build and operate space taxis to take astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rocket, named Liberty, would be much cheaper than the Ares I, because the unfinished NASA-designed upper stage of the Ares I would be replaced with the first stage of the Ariane 5, which has been launched successfully 41 consecutive times. The lower stage of the Liberty, a longer version of the shuttle booster built by ATK, would be almost unchanged from the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the companies competing for NASA's space taxi business, like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, are looking at using a low-end version of the Atlas V rocket built by the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>. ATK hopes the Liberty can take business away from the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> with a greater lift capability (44,500 pounds to low-Earth orbit) at a cost (less than $180 million) it says is lower than that of the Atlas V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberty could also solve other issues. Launching from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, it would generate about 300 jobs and make use of facilities that might otherwise sit idle after the space shuttles are retired this year. The Atlas V launches from the neighboring Cape Canaveral Air Force station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK is seeking part of $200 million that NASA will distribute next month for commercial crew efforts. The Liberty's first test launching could take place in 2013, and it could be ready to carry astronauts two years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK and Astrium also hope the rocket can compete for future contracts for space station cargo. With an eventual four to six launchings a year, the Liberty could also help reduce the cost of the heavy-lift rocket that NASA is to develop for deep-space missions. The current design of the heavy-lift calls for the same solid rocket motors as the Liberty.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers studied hundreds of images over the period of two Martian years, or four Earth years. During the winter months, a blanket of dry ice covers the dunes and destabilizes the sand, Dr. Hansen said. As a result, the sand moves, causing avalanches and creating new alcoves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the images the scientists have looked at, about 40 percent of the dunes seem to have gone through some modification over the two Martian years. In certain spots, hundreds of cubic yards of sand had come down the face of the dunes in avalanches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If their funding continues, the team plans to keep observing changes in the dunes, since the Reconnaissance Orbiter has enough fuel to stay in orbit until 2020.</p>

In 1995, astronomers began to be able to detect Jupiter-sized ''exoplanets'' by their gravitational effect on the stars they orbit. And with the launch of the Kepler satellite in March 2009 and the release last week of the data it has so far gathered, astronomy has crossed a major threshold. The Kepler has discovered 1,235 potential planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this so striking is the satellite's instruments always point at the same tiny arc of the Milky Way near the constellation called the Northern Cross -- only one four-hundredth of the sky. The Kepler team leader, William Borucki, at the Ames Research Center in Northern California, says that if Kepler could see the whole sky, it would have found some 400,000 planets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite detects possible planets by measuring the light of 156,000 stars in its field of view and looking for slight dips in brightness when a planet crosses in front of a star. All of these planets will have to be validated using telescopes. That will take years, given the limited number of astronomers and powerful telescopes on this planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are any of the Kepler's planets another Earth? Fifty-four of them look as if they might be the right size and the right distance from their stars to be in a habitable zone, where liquid water can exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As exciting as the Kepler results are, they are also a reminder of how fictional science fiction -- with its multiplicity of worlds and easy interstellar travel -- really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we launched ourselves today toward the nearest planetary system discovered so far -- at speeds we can already conceivably travel in space -- we would have 300,000 years of asking ''when will we get there?'' before we got there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is going.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the continuing real-life drama that surpasses the most audacious soap opera narrative, the astronaut Mark E. Kelly announced Friday that he would honor his commitment to lead a two-week shuttle mission to the International Space Station -- 200 miles up, and orbiting the earth at 17,500 miles an hour -- while his wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, continues her gradual, uncertain recovery from the grievous head wound she suffered during last month's deadly rampage by a gunman in Tucson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appearing at a news conference in Houston, his face conveying the twinning of anxiety and resolve, Captain Kelly, of the Navy, laid out the thought process behind his choice: ''Considering a bunch of other factors, including what Gabrielle would want me to do, and what her parents and her family and my family would like, I ultimately made the decision that I would like to return and command S.T.S. 134'' -- Space Transportation System 134, NASA's official name for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the commander, who in the past has said that his wife can understand him, repeatedly declined to say whether Ms. Giffords helped him to reach his decision, or whether she was even aware of the decision. Instead, more than once, he expressed confidence that he had her support. ''I know my wife very well, and I know what she would want,'' the commander said. ''And that makes the decision easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That decision marked the latest breathtaking turn in a marriage between two accomplished people that through the intrusion of tragedy has become part of the public domain. They have become the nation's couple, this wounded congresswoman and this duty-bound astronaut, in ways that transcend their shared commitment to public service -- so much so that many turned to the Internet to suggest what was best for this husband and wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should he stay by his wife's side? Or should he lead the mission he had trained for well more than a year to lead? Is it bullheaded of him to go on such a risky business trip? Or is this what she wants him to do, expects him to do? And how does a two-week trip to space compare to a yearlong tour in Afghanistan by soldiers with complicated domestic situations of their own?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though a few criticized Captain Kelly's decision -- saying his duty was to be at his wife's side, not in space -- the consensus appeared to be that the astronaut had made the correct and courageous move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I imagine a woman of strength and character such as hers wouldn't have wanted it any other way,'' wrote Joellelevand on Jezebel, a pop-culture blog geared to women. And on the NASAWatch blog, Jsonova99 wrote, ''He's a pro and I have no doubt he'll bring his A game to the mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in the real and not virtual world, the congresswoman's staff members were elated with the commander's announcement. ''We all were kind of hoping this would be the decision he would make,'' said Pia Carusone, the chief of staff for Ms. Giffords. ''There's no doubt in anyone's mind that this is what Gabby would want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some people questioned the choice. ''The truly courageous and strong thing to do is to be an accessible partner to your disabled wife who is now relearning almost every function of her body and intellect,'' one reader wrote to The New York Times Web site. ''Just sayin'.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about his ''just sayin' '' critics, Captain Kelly said that many people do not know what the Giffords and Kelly families know about Ms. Giffords's condition, her support system and her admiration for the space mission. ''I think if they had more details about those things, you'd probably have less people being critical,'' said the astronaut, who wore a blue wristband decorated with a peace sign, a heart sign and the name ''Gabby.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the shooting rampage on Jan. 8, which killed 6 people and wounded 13, including Ms. Giffords, the nation has followed the congresswoman's wrenching journey from the blood-stained pavement in Tucson to a rehabilitation hospital in Houston, as well as that of her husband. The country has also come to know the story of their romance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giffords, 40, grew up in Tucson, amid cottonwood trees, while Mr. Kelly, 46, grew up in West Orange, N.J., within sight of the Manhattan cityscape. She rode horses; he fought and competed with his twin brother, Scott, who is also a NASA commander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was married and she was dating someone else when they met on a trip to China in 2003. Finding that they shared much in common -- including love for exercise and the outdoors -- they married four years later. Since then they have juggled high-pressure job commitments and long distances; he lives in Houston, where he has two daughters, and she lives in Arizona and in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the shooting in Tucson, and an awful telephone call to Captain Kelly in Houston, and a brief period when he had to process news reports, quickly retracted, that his wife had died. All of this was less than a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Captain Kelly recalled sitting at his wife's bedside in Tucson, discussing her prognosis with her neurosurgeon and her trauma surgeon. ''At the time, my thought was that I very likely would be sitting in that same seat maybe two, four, six months later -- in that I.C.U., by her bedside,'' he said. In other words, he would not be able to command the space-shuttle mission in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the congresswoman's condition quickly improved, against strong odds, warranting a transfer to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, where she could begin her rehabilitation. Her days are booked from 8 in the morning until after 6 at night, with a full schedule posted on her private room's door: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, meals, much-needed rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her daily commitments played a vital role in his decision-making, the astronaut said. He began to weigh the amount of time he could spend with her against what was in the best interests of NASA and his crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's made progress every day,'' he said, though, again, without providing specifics. ''So about two weeks ago, I started going through the process myself of what would I need in order to get back with my crew to continue training for S.T.S. 134'' -- training that began 18 months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an evaluation of the situation, NASA officials decided that Captain Kelly would go into space. He is scheduled to lead a six-member crew on a two-week trip to the International Space Station on the space shuttleEndeavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what will be the second-to-last shuttle flight to the station before the 30-year-old program ends, the crew will be ferrying up a major scientific instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The $1.5 billion, 8-ton device will peer into the cosmos to detect dark matter, the invisible stuff that may act as cosmic glue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly acknowledged that space flight is a ''risky business'' -- but so, too, is being a member of Congress. He said he weighed these risks, along with his wife's daily demands, the support she has, his responsibility to his crew and his country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel very confident that I made the right decision,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others agree, and have spoken up for Ms. Giffords. For example, Elaine Richardson, a longtime friend of Ms. Giffords who was a bridesmaid at her wedding to Mr. Kelly, said she was thrilled that he decided to go to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Knowing Gabby, she would want him to go up,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''It's an important mission for the country and for him personally. And if he decided not to go, 10 years from now they would both realize it was an opportunity missed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, then, the astronaut trained for his upcoming journey, while the congresswoman continued on her own. Then, at night, she returned to her private hospital room, where the walls are festooned with get-well cards from children and enlarged photographs of Gabby and Mark, hiking in the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Case to Go First</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUCSON -- Jared L. Loughner will not face state murder charges in the Tucson shooting rampage until after the federal government finishes its trial against him, the authorities said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Loughner faces three federal charges of attempted murder in the wounding of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and two of her aides here on Jan. 8; additional federal charges are expected. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASTRONOMERS announced last month that, contrary to previous assumptions, the orbiting body Eris might be smaller than Pluto after all. Since it was the discovery in 2005 of Eris, an object seemingly larger than what had been considered our smallest planet, that precipitated the downgrading of Pluto from full planet to ''dwarf,'' some think it may be time to revisit Pluto's status.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of us can't help rooting for Pluto. We liked the idea of a ninth planet, hanging out there like a period at the end of the gorgeous sentence of the solar system. It gave us a sense of completeness. And besides, we were used to it. Pluto's demotion caused such an outcry because it altered something we thought we knew to be true about our world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, science doesn't, and shouldn't, care what we learned in first grade. If Pluto's odyssey teaches us anything, it's that whenever we think we've discovered a measure of certainty about the universe, it's often fleeting, and more often pure dumb luck. The 1930 discovery of Pluto -- by Clyde Tombaugh, who coincidentally was born 105 years ago today -- is a prime example, a testament not only to Tombaugh's remarkable perseverance, but also to how a stupendously unlikely run of circumstances can lead to scientific glory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for a ninth planet was led by the Harvard-trained Percival Lowell, a Boston Brahmin who was widely known for announcing the existence of a Martian civilization. Lowell's hypotheses about a ''Planet X'' were based on optimistic interpretations of inconclusive data. Many had observed that the orbit of Uranus seemed to be perturbed by a gravitational influence beyond the orbit of Neptune. If the source of that pull could be determined, he speculated, a fellow could point a telescope at that source and find an undiscovered world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Lowell, in the Arizona observatory he had built, set out to do just that. His method was not without precedent. But in 1916, after more than a decade of exquisitely delicate mathematics and erratic searching, Lowell died, his reputation as a gifted crackpot confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen years later, Clyde Tombaugh was hired by V. M. Slipher, the director of the Lowell Observatory, to resume the search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 22, Tombaugh had been making his own telescopes for years in a root cellar on his father's Kansas farm (where the air was cool and still enough to allow for the correction of microscopic flaws in the mirrors he polished by hand). The resulting telescopes were of such high quality that Tombaugh could draw the bands of weather on Jupiter, 400 million miles away. Ambitious but too poor to afford college, Tombaugh had written at random to Slipher, seeking career advice. Slipher took a look at the drawings that Tombaugh had included, and invited him to Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, Tombaugh used a device called a blink comparator to pore over scores of photographic plates, hunting for one moving pinprick amid millions of stars. When he finally found the moving speck in February 1930, it was very nearly where Lowell's mathematics had predicted it would be. Headlines proclaimed Lowell's predictions confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was something strange about the object. It soon became apparent that it was much too small to have exerted any effect on Uranus's orbit. Astronomers then assumed it had to be a moon, with a larger planet nearby. But despite more searching, no larger object came to light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They eventually had to face the fact that the discovery of a new object so near Lowell's predicted location was nothing more than a confounding coincidence. Tombaugh's object, soon christened Pluto, wasn't Planet X. Instead of an example of good old American vision and know-how, the discovery was the incredibly fluky result of a baseless dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades later, this was proved doubly true. Data from the 1989 Voyager 2 flyby showed that the mass of Neptune had been inaccurately measured by about 0.5 percent all along, and that, in fact, the orbit of Uranus had never been inexplicably disturbed to begin with. Percival Lowell had been hunting a ghost. And Clyde Tombaugh, against all odds, had found one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which is to say, science is imperfect. It is a human enterprise, subject to passions and whims, accidents and luck. Astronomers have since discovered dozens of other objects in our solar system approaching Pluto's size, amounting to a whole separate class of orbiting bodies. And just this week, researchers announced that they had identified 1,235 possible planets in other star systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can mourn the demotion of our favorite planet. But the best way to honor Lowell and Tombaugh is to celebrate the fact that Pluto -- while never quite the world it was predicted to be -- is part of a universe more complex, varied and surprising than even its discoverers could have imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, for those of us who grew up chanting ''My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us New Pizza,'' nine planets will always seem more fitting than eight. New facts are unsettling. But with the right mindset, the new glories can more than make up for the loss of the old.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have cracked the Milky Way like a pinata, and planets are now pouring out so fast that they do not know what to do with them all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a long-awaited announcement, scientists operating NASA's Kepler planet-hunting satellite reported on Wednesday that they had identified 1,235 possible planets orbiting other stars, potentially tripling the number of known planets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the new candidates, 68 are one and a quarter times the size of the Earth or smaller -- smaller, that is, than any previously discovered planets outside the solar system, which are known as exoplanets. Fifty-four of the possible exoplanets are in the so-called habitable zones of stars dimmer and cooler than the Sun, where temperatures should be moderate enough for liquid water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said that it would take years to confirm that all of these candidates were really planets -- by using ground-based telescopes to measure their masses, for example, or inspecting them to see if background stars are causing optical mischief. Many of them might never be vetted because of the dimness of their stars and the lack of telescope time and astronomers to do it all. But statistical tests of a sample suggest that 80 to 95 percent of the objects on it are real, as opposed to blips in the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It boggles the mind,'' said the Kepler team's leader, William Borucki, of the Ames Research Center in Northern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, not one of them appears to be another Earth, the kind of cosmic Eden fit for life as we know it, but the new results represent only four months' worth of data on a three-and-a-half-year project, and have left astronomers optimistic that they will eventually find Earth-like planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the first time in human history, we have a pool of potentially rocky habitable-zone planets,'' said Sara Seager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who works with Kepler. ''This is the first big step forward to answering the ancient question, 'How common are other Earths?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Borucki noted that the Kepler telescope surveys only one four-hundredth of the sky. If it could see the whole sky, he said, ''we would see 400,000 candidates.'' He is the lead author of a paper describing the new results that has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate announcement, to be published in the journal Nature on Thursday, a group of Kepler astronomers led by Jack Lissauer of Ames said it had found a star with six planets -- the most Kepler has yet discovered around one star -- orbiting in close ranks in the same plane, no farther from their star than Mercury is from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This dense packing, Dr. Lissauer said, seems to violate all the rules astronomers have begun to discern about how planetary systems form and evolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is sending me back to the drawing board,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summarizing the news from the cosmos, Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, a veteran exoplanet hunter and a mainstay of the Kepler work, said, ''There are so many messages here that it's hard to know where to begin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the Borucki team's announcement ''an extraordinary planet windfall, a moment that will be written in textbooks. It will be thought of as watershed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Fischer, an astronomer at Yale who is not part of the Kepler team, said, ''This is an amazing era of discovery for astronomy.'' Kepler, she added, had ''blown the lid off everything we thought we knew about exoplanets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched into orbit around the Sun in March 2009, stares at a patch of the Milky Way near the Northern Cross, measuring the brightness of 156,000 stars every 30 minutes, looking for a pattern of dips that would be caused by planets crossing in front of their suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to assess the frequency of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. But in the four months of data analyzed so far, a similar telescope looking at our own Sun would have been lucky to have seen the Earth pass even once. Three transits are required for a planet to show up in Kepler's elaborate data-processing pipeline, which means that Kepler's next scheduled data release, in June 2012, could be a moment of truth for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For dimmer and cooler stars, the habitable, or ''Goldilocks,'' zone, would be smaller, however, and planets in it would rack up transits more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists had eagerly anticipated Wednesday's data release since June, when Kepler scientists issued their first list of some 300 stars that were suspected of harboring planets but held back another 400 for study. In the intervening months, Mr. Borucki said, some of those candidates have been eliminated, but hundreds more have been added that would otherwise have been reported in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the 400 was a Sun-like star about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus that went by the name of KOI 157, for Kepler Object of Interest. In the spring of 2009, astronomers noticed that it seemed to have five candidate planets, four with nearly the same orbital periods, and in the same plane, like an old vinyl record, Dr. Lissauer said. Two of them came so close that every 50 days one of them would look as large as a full moon as seen from the other, Dr. Lissauer calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got very interested in this system,'' Dr. Lissauer said. ''Five was the most we had around any target.'' Moreover, the planets' proximity to one another meant that they would interact gravitationally, allowing them to be weighed. In the fall, a sixth planet -- the innermost -- was found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By measuring the slight variations in transit times caused by the gravitational interference of the inner five planets with one another, Dr. Lissauer and his colleagues were able to calculate their masses and densities. These measurements confirmed they were so-called super-Earths, with masses ranging from 2 to 13 times that of the Earth. But they were also puffy, probably containing mixtures of rock, water and gas, rather than being pure rock like another super-Earth, Kepler 10b, a hunk of lava whose existence was announced last month at a meeting in Seattle. Dr. Lissauer described them as ''sort of like marshmallows with a little hard-candy core.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Dr. Lissauer said, ''super-Earths might not resemble Earth at all. They may be more like Neptune than Earth-like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said the Kepler 11 system, as it is now known, should ''keep theorists busy and off the streets for a long time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki said the growing number of small planets revealed by Kepler was a welcome change from the early days of exoplanet research, when most of the planets discovered were Jupiter-size giants hugging their stars in close orbits, leading theorists to speculate that smaller planets might be thrown outward from their stars by gravitational forces or dragged right into those suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those little guys are still there,'' he said, ''and we're delighted to see them.''</p>

Last year, the Obama administration pushed through an ambitious transformation for NASA: canceling the Ares I rocket, which was to be the successor to the current generation of space shuttles, and turning to the commercial sector for astronaut transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, most of the attention in this new commercial space race has focused on <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which has five decades of experience building spacecraft, and <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short -- a brash upstart that gained credibility last year with two launchings of its Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, led by Elon Musk, a founder of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, already has a NASA contract for delivering cargo to the space station, and says that it can easily add up to seven seats to its Dragon cargo capsule to make it suitable for passengers. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is also designing a capsule, capable of carrying seven passengers, under the corporate-sounding designation of CST-100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> are not the only competitors seeking to provide space taxi services, a program that NASA calls commercial crew. Last year, in the first-round financing provided for preliminary development, Sierra Nevada Space Systems won the largest award: $20 million out of a total of $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, another space company, <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, announced it had submitted a similar bid for a space plane it wants financed during the second round. NASA is to announce the winners by the end of March, and they will divide $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of NASA's $19 billion budget goes toward human spaceflight -- the space shuttles, the International Space Station -- and $200 million this year is just a small slice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this is indeed the path to do this work, it's probably not what they should be putting into it,'' said Mr. Sirangelo, who is also chairman emeritus of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group. ''But on the other hand, it's a lot more than we had before. And it's an acknowledgment there's momentum in the industry and what we're trying to accomplish. So that's good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the second round, NASA would like narrow its choices down to two, maybe three, systems to finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think this is in effect a one-year race to see who gets the furthest,'' Mr. Sirangelo said, ''and at the end of that, presumably the next two years of the authorization bill gets funded, and then you compete for that pot of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blueprint for NASA, passed by Congress last year and signed into law by President Obama, calls for spending on commercial crew to rise to $500 million each year in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who was one of the primary architects of the blueprint, as the authorization act was called, has said the intent was to provide $6 billion over six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what Congress puts into the budget could be far less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not getting $6 billion over six years for commercial crew,'' said a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak for attribution. ''That's never going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aide estimated commercial crew might receive half that much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Congress has not passed the final 2011 budget, and Mr. Obama wants to freeze spending at many federal agencies. Whether the freeze includes NASA will not be known until the president's 2012 budget request is released in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Sierra Nevada has the lowest profile of the companies seeking commercial crew business, it is not new. The parent company, the <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span>, is a privately held defense electronics firm founded in 1963, and a few years ago, it bought several space companies and rolled them into the space systems subsidiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space systems subsidiary, located outside Denver, is the largest manufacturer in the United States of small satellites, Mr. Sirangelo said. The satellites, used for communications and other purposes, cannot do everything that large ones can do, but what they can do, they do more cheaply and more efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dream Chaser embodies the same philosophy. ''There are some tasks that can be done by smaller, cheaper vehicles that used to be done by very expensive vehicles,'' Mr. Sirangelo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sirangelo said the company had invested its own money into the Dream Chaser -- indeed, more than the $20 million that NASA has provided. Over the past year, the company has done a test-firing of the engines it plans to use on the Dream Chaser, and it dropped a scale model of the spacecraft from a helicopter to verify the aerodynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a jump from making spacecraft components and small satellites to building a crew-carrying space plane, and where Sierra Nevada lacks in skills and experience, it has brought in other companies and institutions. Its Dream Chaser partners include Draper Laboratory, which has been designing spacecraft guidance systems since Apollo; NASA's Langley Research Center, which did much of the development that the Dream Chaser is based on; <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which has also worked on space planes; and <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> that builds the Atlas V rocket that the Dream Chaser would ride atop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic, the spacecraft division of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin empire, signed on as a strategic partner in December. Among the possible roles that Virgin could play is selling seats on the Dream Chaser. (Virgin signed a similar agreement with Orbital.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design of the Dream Chaser also has a long lineage, inspired by a Soviet spacecraft. In 1982, an Australian reconnaissance airplane photographed a Russian trawler pulling something with stubby wings out of the Indian Ocean. It turned out to be a test flight of a space plane called the Bor-4, and the craft captured enough curiosity that engineers at NASA Langley copied it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA called its version the HL-20, and for a while in 1991, it looked to be the low-cost choice for taking astronauts to and from the space station. Then the NASA administrator who liked it, Vice Adm. Richard Truly of the Navy, left, and the man who replaced him, Daniel S. Goldin, thought it was not cheap enough and ended the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dream Chaser design keeps the exact outer shape from the HL-20 -- a decision that allows Sierra Nevada to take advantage of years of wind tunnel tests that Langley had performed -- while modifying the design within. The biggest change is the addition of two engines, which reduces the number of passengers to seven from 10, but adds maneuverability. To finish developing the Dream Chaser would require less than $1 billion, Mr. Sirangelo said, and it could be ready to fly an orbital test flight in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He imagines that one flight could combine a number of tasks -- taking astronauts to the space station and then stopping on the return trip to repair or refuel a satellite. ''This vehicle is perfectly designed to do all that,'' Mr. Sirangelo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> -- a company in Dulles, Va., that builds and launches rockets and satellites for everything from television broadcasts to scientific research -- say they are excited by the possibilities of commercial crew, but they are more cautious. Orbital, founded in 1982, was a survivor from the last boom-and-bust in commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its space plane design is a refinement of the HL-20. Following in the pattern of tapping Greek mythology for the names of its spacecraft, Orbital calls its plane Prometheus. Orbital says development of Prometheus would cost $3.5 billion to $4 billion, which would include the cost of upgrading the Atlas V rocket and two test flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With enough financial support, David W. Thompson, chief executive of Orbital, is sure that his company can build and operate Prometheus. But he is less sure that his industry is at a tipping point for spaceflight to become much more common, driving down prices and opening up space to new businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it depends on what the demand curve really is,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''I would say I'm highly skeptical.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: February 2, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the emerging role of private businesses in NASA's spaceflight program misstated the number of passengers a crew capsule in development at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> would be capable of carrying.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We only know the planet as well as we know the star,'' said Natalie Batalha, an astronomer from San Jose State University who works on NASA's planet-searching satellite Kepler. To that end, Kepler listens to the internal vibrations of stars, gleaning crucial information on their size and structure.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By speeding up this data and transforming it into sound waves, Kepler's astronomers have produced a sort of iTunes sampler of the cosmos, individual stars banging and whistling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of these are music only the Borg could love,'' said Jon Jenkins, a Kepler data analyst from the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., referring to the cybernetic foes from the ''Star Trek'' series. Dr. Jenkins made the recordings presented here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler monitors the light of 156,000 stars, checking for dips in intensity caused when their planets, if they have any, pass in front of them. It also records high-frequency variations in stars' light caused by vibrations or ''starquakes'' in the stars themselves, from which astronomers practicing the science of asteroseismology can deduce the age and size of the star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By knowing how big the star really is, and the dips in light from the planetary crossings, astronomers can measure the exact size of any planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these audio clips, several weeks' worth of Kepler measurements of a star have been compressed into a few seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 10b is the first rocky planet to be discovered by Kepler. The first audio contains only the vibrations of Kepler 10b's star. The next audio clip has the sound of the planet going by as a ''wump wump wump.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIC1268220 is an eclipsing binary, in which a pair of stars pass in front of each other, producing a bass thumping of eclipses along with a ''whistling forest'' of stellar vibrations, in the words of Dr. Jenkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIC12253350 is an unusual star. On a graph, its oscillations follow a heart-shaped envelope. The Kepler astrophysicists do not understand why, but they liked it so much that they put the heart-shaped oscillations on a T-shirt with a quotation about the cosmos by Carl Sagan: ''For such small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.''</p>

Kelly: Will he fly or not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly, a Navy officer who flew 39 combat missions in the Persian Gulf war, is scheduled to fly the shuttle Endeavour on a two-week mission to the International Space Station in April.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his wife at the beginning of a long and arduous rehabilitation program to recover from a gunshot wound to the head, Captain Kelly and his bosses at NASA will have to determine whether he can maintain the training regimen in the weeks leading up to the launching and command the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be Captain Kelly's fourth trip to space, but with the shuttle program winding down, giving up this flight would almost certainly mean also giving up his last chance to command a shuttle mission. No shuttle commander has ever been removed so close to a launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not there yet,'' Stephanie Schierholz, a NASA spokeswoman, said of when Captain Kelly and NASA's leadership would decide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While working through the decision, NASA has kept its options open by naming a backup commander for the mission, Frederick W. Sturckow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark is still the commander,'' said Peggy A. Whitson, the chief astronaut, but she said that having a backup commander would allow the crew to continue training and Captain Kelly to ''focus on his wife's care.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly, who is on leave, said in the NASA announcement of a backup commander that he had recommended the step ''to prepare to complete the mission in my absence, if necessary.'' But he added that he was ''very hopeful that I will be in a position to rejoin'' the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, an emeritus professor of political science and international affairs at the Space Policy Institute of George Washington University, said, ''I don't envy them the choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark is not irreplaceable for this mission,'' Professor Logsdon said, ''and naming a backup is the prudent thing for NASA to do. There are many highly qualified shuttle commanders. But to lose this opportunity would be personally very hard for him, since it would most likely be his last chance to go to space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly might be able to return to orbit, ferried aloft by a Russian Soyuz, as part of an expedition on the space station, as his brother Scott is now doing. But strapping into the left seat of the shuttle's forward flight deck is the pinnacle of the pilot's calling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate decision involves weighing Captain Kelly's determination to achieve a goal he has trained so long for and the needs of his family, as well as NASA's need to have a commander whose concentration and focus are unwavering and the cohesiveness of a crew that has worked closely to achieve a common goal. NASA has no rigid rules about removing crew members from missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Navy, where Captain Kelly got his training, has taken pilots who are going through family crises off flight status, but the decisions are made by the commanding officer with advice from a ''human factors board'' that involves flight surgeons and officers, said Lt. Aaron Kakiel, a Navy spokesman. ''There's no automatic something that triggers something else,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle crew members have been replaced because of illness or family crises. In 1997, Jeffrey S. Ashby, a retired Navy captain, was replaced on what would have been his first shuttle mission when his wife, Diana, was diagnosed with terminal cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven A. Hawley, a former astronaut who flew with Captain Ashby on a later mission, recalled that ''he didn't have the ability to focus properly on the mission,'' and that Captain Ashby had recommended the move himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always admired that very much,'' Dr. Hawley said. ''That someone would have the presence of mind to recognize that that was going on and make that courageous and appropriate decision -- you don't always assume people will do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experienced fighter pilots like Captain Kelly are better equipped than most to deal with personal crises, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., a former director of the shuttle program who left NASA last year. ''Folks who are in the business -- particularly those who came up as military pilots -- are very good at compartmentalizing the work they have to do in the cockpits of the spacecraft from their personal lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had commanders who had plenty of personal angst in their lives, and they flew great flights,'' Mr. Hale said. ''It really comes down to where he thinks his priorities and his mental state are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, if Ms. Giffords's recovery is on track, she might urge her husband to take on the challenge, said George Abbey, a former director of the Johnson Space Center. ''I think Gabrielle would want him to fly,'' he said. ''She is a great supporter of his career. She would say fly, but I think a lot of it is really going to be up to Mark.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abbey also suggested that the launching might be delayed, as often happens. ''He's going to get more time,'' Mr. Abbey predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronaut community is tight, bound by common careers and experiences, and by tragedy. Today's members of the astronaut corps lost colleagues and friends when the shuttle Columbia broke up during its return to Earth in February 2003. From the fire aboard Apollo 1 that killed three astronauts to the loss of 14 astronauts in the shuttles Columbia and Challenger, which broke apart after liftoff in 1986, astronauts and their families say they are open about the worst that might happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he prepared for his 2006 mission, Captain Kelly answered questions from NASA's media office about the risks astronauts prepare for. ''Strapping into a rocket ship is something you don't do lightly,'' he said, adding that he had talked to his daughters about the risks, which they knew well having grown up with the children of astronauts who died in the Columbia accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those risks, he said, have to be balanced against reward. ''It's not just the personal benefit to me; it's what's the benefit of our space program to our country and to the planet, and I think that's -- that's pretty, pretty big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while astronauts and their families may be better prepared for crisis than others, the danger is usually associated with the astronauts, not their families, said Eileen Hawley, a former NASA public affairs official and the wife of Dr. Hawley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're a community that's typically prepared for risk, and we understand it,'' she said, ''but not when it's something like this.''</p>

It is a smudge of light only a tiny fraction of the size of our own Milky Way galaxy, and it existed when the universe was only 480 million years old. Its light has been on its way to us for 13.2 billion years, making it the long-distance champion in an expanding universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed, the discovery takes astronomers deep into an era when stars and galaxies were first lighting up the universe and burning their way out of a primordial fog known as the dark ages. The birth rate of stars, they concluded from their observations, increased tenfold in the 200 million years between the time of the newly discovered galaxy and the next earliest known galaxies, which date to 650 million years after the Big Bang -- a rate even faster than astronomers had thought.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is clearly an era when galaxies were evolving rapidly,'' the astronomers said in an article published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The team was led by Rychard J. Bouwens of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, and Garth Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the Hubble was refurbished in 2009, Dr. Bouwens and his colleagues observed a patch of sky known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field in the constellation Fornax with the telescope's new Wide Field Camera 3, which is sensitive to the long-wave ''heat'' radiation known as infrared. That is important because as galaxies fly away from us in the expanding universe, the light they emit is shifted to longer wavelengths -- ''red-shifted,'' in cosmological parlance -- the way a receding siren sounds lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That data yielded a crop of galaxies dating from 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang and a hint of the even earlier galaxy, in which visible light appears to have been shifted all the way into the infrared by a factor of 10, corresponding to a time of only 480 million years after the universe began. After a year of testing and simulations, the team concluded that it was the most primordial galaxy yet found. Spectroscopic observations with the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope, however, are needed to cement the identification of the smudge as a galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the new result fits in well with a picture cosmologists have developed from a variety of sources. In it, the first stars formed around 200 million or 300 million years after the Big Bang, and then the universe continued building more and more stars, reaching a peak of fecundity when it was about two and a half billion years old. Its glory days behind it, the cosmos is now in a middle-age slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They leave unclear, however, a longstanding mystery as to how the universe became transparent. As the initial fires of the Big Bang cooled, cosmologists say, the universe was enveloped in a pea-soup fog of hydrogen gas. Over the next billion years, that fog lifted as the hydrogen atoms were stripped of their electrons -- ionized -- by high-energy radiation, presumably from the early stars, and became transparent. The problem is that astronomers disagree on whether they have been able to find enough stars or galaxies in the very early universe yet to account for the amount of light it would have taken to burn off all the fog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, some astronomers have suggested that massive black holes could have been partly or mostly responsible for clearing the dark ages. The black holes would have whipped the space around them with high-energy particles and radiation shed by matter in its death throes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bouwens said it was not quite time to resort to black holes as the explanation, however; he noted that many more galaxies could be lurking in the noise just below the limits of detection for the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really are not probing faint enough with the current Hubble observations to see beyond the tip of the iceberg,'' Dr. Bouwens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope, which is expected to be launched later this decade once NASA figures out how to pay for it, has been designed to find these primordial galaxies and thus illuminate the dark ages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA, as it attempts to squeeze a workable human spaceflight program into a tight federal budget, the answers appear to be ''somewhere'' and ''not anytime soon.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the space shuttles are retired this year -- and only one flight remains for each of the three -- NASA will no longer have its own means for getting American astronauts to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What comes next is a muddle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program to send astronauts back to the moon, known as Constellation, was canceled last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its place, Congress has asked NASA to build a heavy-lift rocket, one that can go deep into space carrying big loads. But NASA says it cannot possibly build such a rocket with the budget and schedule it has been given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another crucial component of NASA's new mission -- helping commercial companies develop space taxis for taking astronauts into orbit -- is getting less money than the Obama administration requested. Companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> that are interested in bidding for the work do not yet know whether they can make a profitable venture of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the future of NASA, ''it's hard at this point to speculate,'' Douglas R. Cooke, associate administrator for NASA's exploration systems mission directorate, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel that oversees safety at NASA took note of the uncertainty in its annual report, released this month. ''What is NASA's exploration mission?'' the members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel asked in their report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel added: ''It is not in the nation's best interest to continue functioning in this manner. The Congress, the White House, and NASA must quickly reach a consensus position on the future of the agency and the future of the United States in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nagging worry is that compromises will leave NASA without enough money to accomplish anything, and that -- even as billions of dollars are spent -- the future destination and schedule of NASA's rockets could turn out to be ''nowhere'' and ''never.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that case, human spaceflight at NASA would consist just of its work aboard the International Space Station, with the Russians providing the astronaut transportation indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're on a path with an increasing probability of a bad outcome,'' said Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now directs the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA study, completed last month, came up with a framework for spaceflight in the two next decades but deferred setting specific destinations, much less timetables for getting there. One of the study's conclusions was that trying to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 -- as President Obama had challenged the agency to do in a speech last April -- was ''not prudent,'' because it would be too expensive and narrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the study advocated a ''capability-driven framework'' -- developing elements like spacecraft, propulsion systems and deep-space living quarters that could be used and reused for a variety of exploration missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Washington, the fight is less of a conflict of grand visions than a squabble over dollars and the design details of a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, in passing an authorization act for NASA, which laid out a blueprint for the next three years, Congress called for NASA to start work on the heavy-lift rocket. It also said that the design should be based on available technologies from the existing space shuttles and from Constellation; that the rocket should be ready by the end of 2016, and that NASA could have about $11.5 billion to develop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who helped shape the NASA blueprint, said, ''If we can't do it for that, then we ought to question whether or not we can build a rocket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blueprint, signed into law by President Obama in October, gave NASA 90 days to explain how it would build the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, the agency told Congress that it had decided on preferred designs for the rocket and the crew capsule for carrying astronauts, but could yet not fit them into the schedule and constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All our models say 'no,' '' said Elizabeth Robinson, NASA's chief financial officer, ''even models that have generous affordability considerations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said NASA was continuing to explore how it might reduce costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of days after receiving the report, Senator Nelson said he had talked to the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., and ''told him he has to follow the law, which requires a new rocket by 2016.'' He added, ''And NASA has to do it within the budget the law requires.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The track record for large aerospace development projects, both inside and outside of NASA, is that they almost always take longer and cost more than initially estimated. If costs for the heavy-lift rocket swell, the project could, as Constellation did, divert money from other parts of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, many NASA observers wonder how the agency can afford to finance both the heavy-lift rocket and the commercial space taxis, which are supposed to begin flying at about the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're setting themselves up again for a long development program whose completion is beyond the horizon,'' James A. M. Muncy, a space policy consultant, said of the current heavy-lift design. ''The question is, what does Congress want more? Do they want to just want to keep the contractors on contract, or do they want the United States to explore space?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the situation at NASA ''a train wreck,'' one ''where everyone involved knows it's a train wreck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constellation, started in 2005 under the Bush administration, aimed to return to the moon by 2020 and set up a base there in the following years. But Constellation never received as much money as originally promised, which slowed work and raised the overall price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barack Obama was running for president, he said he supported the moon goal. But after he took office, he did not show much enthusiasm for it. His request for the 2010 fiscal year did not seek immediate cuts in Constellation but trimmed the projected spending in future years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration also set up a blue-ribbon panel, led by Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, to review the program. The panel found that Constellation could not fit into the projected budget -- $100 billion over 10 years -- and would need $45 billion more to get back on track. Extending the space station five years beyond 2015 would add another $14 billion, the group concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel could not find an alternative that would fit, either. It said that for a meaningful human spaceflight program that would push beyond low-Earth orbit, NASA would need $128 billion -- $28 billion more than the administration wanted to spend -- over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the country was not willing to spend that much, NASA should be asked to do less, the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last February, when unveiling the budget request for fiscal year 2011, the Obama administration said it wanted to cancel Constellation, turn to commercial companies for transportation to low-Earth orbit and invest heavily in research and development on technologies for future deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama budget requested more money for NASA -- but for other parts of the agency like robotic science missions and aviation. The proposed allotment for human spaceflight was still at levels that the Augustine committee had said were not workable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In pushing to cancel Constellation, one Obama administration official after another called it ''unexecutable,'' so expensive that it limped along for years without discernible progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that we poured $9 billion into an unexecutable program really isn't an excuse to pour another $50 billion into it and still not have an executable program,'' said James Kohlenberger, chief of staff of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, at a news conference last February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same news conference, Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, noted that Constellation, without a budget increase, would not reach the moon until well after the 2020 target. ''The Augustine report made it clear that we wouldn't have gotten to beyond low Earth orbit until 2028 and even then would not have the funding to build the lander,'' she said. But with the new road map, NASA may not get to its destinations any faster. As for the ultimate goal of landing people on Mars, which President Obama said he wanted NASA to accomplish by the mid-2030s, it is even slipping further into the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To most people living in 1633, the idea that something as expansive and firm as the Earth was not the center of the universe was still a ridiculous notion. But only with the acceptance that the Earth is actually a small rock going around the Sun did the study of the heavens start to make sense.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geology had a similar intellectual blind spot just 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space age had already begun, the first computers were crunching numbers, and yet many, if not most, earth scientists thought the continents were stuck, unmoving on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American geologists were particularly stubborn. ''I had been told as an undergraduate at M.I.T. that good scientists did not work on foolish ideas like continental drift,'' recalled Lynn Sykes, an emeritus professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The field of geology in 1960, when Dr. Sykes began his graduate studies at the Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia, was much like biology a century earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geologists studied individual rock formations the way biologists catalogued animal and plant species. Only after ''On the Origin of Species,'' published in 1859, did the theory of evolution tie together the study of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1960, geologists still did not have a framework to understand volcanoes, earthquakes and other processes that shape Earth. Dr. Sykes said he thought that his adviser, Jack Oliver, was also not a believer in continental drift. Within a decade, the research of Dr. Oliver, who died recently at age 87, Dr. Sykes and others had made the notion of static continents as quaint and archaic as the stationary Earth that Galileo was forced to accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's now difficult to see why we didn't get it,'' Dr. Sykes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German geophysicist Alfred Wegener had proposed in 1912 that the continents were once all connected, then broke up and drifted apart. Wegener was not the first to notice that the east coast of South America seemed to fit together with the west coast of Africa, but he assembled a wealth of geological and fossil evidence to support the theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reception was often hostile. Critics pointed out that Wegener's explanation for why continents would drift -- that the spinning of the Earth caused them to plow through the ocean crust -- could not work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in the 1960s, new data led scientists to take a closer look. Dr. Sykes was studying shallow earthquakes that occurred along midocean ridges, and Dr. Oliver, along with Bryan Isacks, another Lamont scientist, were exploring deep earthquakes near Fuji and Tonga in the South Pacific. In 1968, the three wrote a landmark paper that was for many the convincing proof for the emerging theory of plate tectonics, showing how all those different seismic signals made sense if the Earth's crust were broken up into separate plates that slowly slid around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As plates pull apart, crash together, slide past each other, they fuel volcanoes, generate earthquakes and push up mountains. The San Andreas Fault made sense, as did midocean ridges where tectonic plates pull apart and form new ocean floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of the really great breakthroughs in science are unifications,'' said Owen J. Gingerich, a science historian at Harvard. Newton's laws of motion unified the sky and Earth as ruled by the same physics; that was radically different from the earlier Aristotelian concept, in which the two realms were separate. Einstein's laws of relativity unified space and time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, plate tectonics was an enormous unifying theory that began to make sense of disparate sorts of phenomena,'' Dr. Gingerich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In planetary astronomy, there has been in recent years another shift -- in this case, away from the quaint notion that the planets have always been following the same orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Russian-American scholar Immanuel Velikovsky wrote ''Worlds in Collision'' in 1950, describing catastrophic near collisions and the wandering of planets, astronomers dismissed it as crank science. After all, how could anything push around the planets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The particulars of Velikovsky's suppositions, based on readings of mythology, are still crank science, but the history of the solar system is now widely accepted as much more chaotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new model has the giant planets forming much closer together, with Uranus and Neptune bunched closer to where Jupiter and Saturn are today. Then their orbits became unstable and Uranus and Neptune were flung outward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this context, the formation of giant planets makes more sense. (Otherwise, for instance, there would not have been enough material where Uranus is now to form Uranus.) So do the orbits of the icy bodies beyond Neptune, including Pluto, which would have been scattered by the wild orbits of Neptune and Uranus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the universe, almost everything moves and changes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a great many fields, researchers would give their eyeteeth to have a direct glimpse of the past. Instead, they generally have to piece together remote conditions using remnants like weathered fossils, decaying parchments or mummified remains. Cosmology, the study of the origin and evolution of the universe, is different. It is the one arena in which we can actually witness history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pinpoints of starlight we see with the naked eye are photons that have been streaming toward us for a few years or a few thousand. The light from more distant objects, captured by powerful telescopes, has been traveling toward us far longer than that, sometimes for billions of years. When we look at such ancient light, we are seeing -- literally -- ancient times.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past decade, as observations of such ancient starlight have provided deep insight into the universe's past, they have also, surprisingly, provided deep insight into the nature of the future. And the future that the data suggest is particularly disquieting -- because of something called dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This story of discovery begins a century ago with Albert Einstein, who realized that space is not an immutable stage on which events play out, as Isaac Newton had envisioned. Instead, through his general theory of relativity, Einstein found that space, and time too, can bend, twist and warp, responding much as a trampoline does to a jumping child. In fact, so malleable is space that, according to the math, the size of the universe necessarily changes over time: the fabric of space must expand or contract -- it can't stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Einstein, this was an unacceptable conclusion. He'd spent 10 grueling years developing the general theory of relativity, seeking a better understanding of gravity, but to him the notion of an expanding or contracting cosmos seemed blatantly erroneous. It flew in the face of the prevailing wisdom that, over the largest of scales, the universe was fixed and unchanging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein responded swiftly. He modified the equations of general relativity so that the mathematics would yield an unchanging cosmos. A static situation, like a stalemate in a tug of war, requires equal but opposite forces that cancel each other. Across large distances, the force that shapes the cosmos is the attractive pull of gravity. And so, Einstein reasoned, a counterbalancing force would need to provide a repulsive push. But what force could that be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remarkably, he found that a simple modification of general relativity's equations entailed something that would have, well, blown Newton's mind: antigravity -- a gravitational force that pushes instead of pulls. Ordinary matter, like the Earth or Sun, can generate only attractive gravity, but the math revealed that a more exotic source -- an energy that uniformly fills space, much as steam fills a sauna, only invisibly -- would generate gravity's repulsive version. Einstein called this space-filling energy the cosmological constant, and he found that by finely adjusting its value, the repulsive gravity it produced would precisely cancel the usual attractive gravity coming from stars and galaxies, yielding a static cosmos. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen years later, however, Einstein rued the day he introduced the cosmological constant. In 1929, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies are all rushing away from us. And the best explanation for this cosmic exodus came directly from general relativity: much as poppy seeds in a muffin that's baking move apart as the dough swells, galaxies move apart as the space in which they're embedded expands. Hubble's observations thus established that there was no need for a cosmological constant; the universe is not static.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had Einstein only trusted the original mathematics of general relativity, he would have made one of the most spectacular predictions of all time -- that the universe is expanding -- more than a decade before it was discovered. Instead, he was left to lick his wounds, summarily removing the cosmological constant from the equations of general relativity and, according to one of his trusted colleagues, calling it his greatest blunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story of the cosmological constant was far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to the 1990s, when we find two teams of astronomers undertaking painstakingly precise observations of distant supernovae -- exploding stars so brilliant they can be seen clear across the cosmos -- to determine how the expansion rate of space has changed over the history of the universe. These researchers anticipated that the gravitational attraction of matter dotting the night's sky would slow the expansion, much as Earth's gravity slows the speed of a ball tossed upward. By bearing witness to distant supernovae, cosmic beacons that trace the universe's expansion rate at various moments in the past, the teams sought to make this quantitative. Shockingly, however, when the data were analyzed, the teams found that the expansion rate has not been slowing down. It's been speeding up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's as if that tossed ball shot away from your hand, racing upward faster and faster. You'd conclude that something must be driving the ball away. Similarly, the astronomers concluded that something in space must be pushing galaxies apart ever more quickly. And after scrutinizing the situation, they have found that the push is most likely the repulsive gravity produced by a cosmological constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Einstein introduced the cosmological constant, he envisioned its value being finely adjusted to exactly balance ordinary attractive gravity. But for other values the cosmological constant's repulsive gravity can beat out attractive gravity, and yield the observed accelerated spatial expansion, spot on. Were Einstein still with us, his discovery that repulsive gravity lies within nature's repertoire would have likely garnered him another Nobel prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As remarkable as it is that even one of Einstein's ''bad'' ideas has proven prophetic, many puzzles still surround the cosmological constant: If there is a diffuse, invisible energy permeating space, where did it come from? Is this dark energy (to use modern parlance) a permanent fixture of space, or might its strength change over time? Perhaps most perplexing of all is a question of quantitative detail. The most refined attempts to calculate the amount of dark energy suffusing space miss the measured value by a gargantuan factor of 10123 (that is, a 1 followed by 123 zeroes) -- the single greatest mismatch between theory and observation in the history of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THESE are vital questions that rank among today's deepest mysteries. But standing beside them is an unassailable conclusion, one that's particularly unnerving. If the dark energy doesn't degrade over time, then the accelerated expansion of space will continue unabated, dragging away distant galaxies ever farther and ever faster. A hundred billion years from now, any galaxy that's not resident in our neighborhood will have been swept away by swelling space for so long that it will be racing from us at faster than the speed of light. (Although nothing can move through space faster than the speed of light, there's no limit on how fast space itself can expand.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light emitted by such galaxies will therefore fight a losing battle to traverse the rapidly widening gulf that separates us. The light will never reach Earth and so the galaxies will slip permanently beyond our capacity to see, regardless of how powerful our telescopes may become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of this, when future astronomers look to the sky, they will no longer witness the past. The past will have drifted beyond the cliffs of space. Observations will reveal nothing but an endless stretch of inky black stillness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronomers in the far future have records handed down from our era, attesting to an expanding cosmos filled with galaxies, they will face a peculiar choice: Should they believe ''primitive'' knowledge that speaks of a cosmos very much at odds with what anyone has seen for billions and billions of years? Or should they focus on their own observations and valiantly seek explanations for an island universe containing a small cluster of galaxies floating within an unchanging sea of darkness -- a conception of the cosmos that we know definitively to be wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what if future astronomers have no such records, perhaps because on their planet scientific acumen developed long after the deep night sky faded to black? For them, the notion of an expanding universe teeming with galaxies would be a wholly theoretical construct, bereft of empirical evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've grown accustomed to the idea that with sufficient hard work and dedication, there's no barrier to how fully we can both grasp reality and confirm our understanding. But by gazing far into space we've captured a handful of starkly informative photons, a cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. And the message, echoing across the ages, is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that didn't stop a furious response among horoscope fans on Friday, as news shot around cyberspace -- and, no doubt, outer space -- that the world's zodiac signs might somehow be out of whack, a development with potentially life-changing impact on professional and personal relationships, pickup lines in singles' bars and, presumably, the day-to-day schedule of the former first lady Nancy Reagan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which left professional prognosticators seeking to calm their followers, and astronomers chuckling at the fate of their more metaphysical brethren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't panic,'' Lawrence Grecco, who has worked for 20 years as astrologer and life coach in Manhattan, assured his clients. ''Your sign is your sign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such assurances did little to quell the cosmic kerfuffle after The Star Tribune in Minneapolis innocuously reported Monday that a naturally occurring wobble in the direction of the Earth's axis -- technically known as a ''precession'' -- had altered the alignment of stars' overhead from their traditional star signs, which date back several millennia. The report, citing Parke Kunkle, a board member of the Minnesota Planetarium Society, quickly went viral. Mr. Kunkle, suddenly cast as the Man Who Changed the Zodiac, said he had just been commenting on a well-known fact about the stars in relation to astrology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of the shift resulted in existential, and occasionally grammatical, crises among Aries, Leos and even Ophuchices (more on this later) around the nation and online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My zodiac sign changed,'' wrote one upset Twitter user on Friday morning. ''Does that mean that I'm not anymore who I used to be?!?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, Capricorn, which astrologers say begins its monthlong term in December, actually starts on Jan. 20, based on the actual position of the stars. Aquarius, meanwhile, would be bumped to February. And so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say an ancient Greek astronomer was the first to recognize the precession of the Earth's axis, caused by the gravitational tug of the Moon and the Sun on a not-quite-round Earth. So it is, said Joe Rao, an associate and guest lecturer at the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the Hayden Planetarium, that ''over time the Earth's north pole is pointing toward different stars.'' Which means, in turn, that ''all of the zodiac positions which astrologers use as the foundation of their studies are inaccurate,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As are, of course, any predictions made from them, he added. ''This is, after all, the 21st century,'' Mr. Rao said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such scorn from skeptics is to be expected, said Rob Brezsny, the author of a syndicated weekly horoscope column, who added that the idea that the zodiac was shifting was just another attempt to discredit astrology, in which one in four Americans profess to believe, according to a 2009 Pew Research Center poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brezsny and other astrologers say they have long known that the pairings of constellations and astrological signs don't match, but that Western astrologers don't deal with stars -- as some other branches of astrology do -- but rather the planets and solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they're going to question its foundations,'' he said in an e-mail, referring to scientific skeptics, ''they should at least learn it well enough to know what they're talking about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brezsny said the argument that the zodiac was off kilter was old news but he was shocked how fast the Star Tribune article -- inspired by a blog item on the LiveScience Web site -- caught fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday, Monty Taylor, a veteran star man from Manhattan, said he and other astrologers were e-mailing, saying, ''Oh, here we go again. One step forward and two steps back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more shocking for some was the report that the 12-sign system would be adding a new, and ominously a 13th, sign -- Ophiuchus, the snake holder -- which ancient Babylonians dumped. (Maybe they were superstitious?). Its cycle runs from Nov. 29 to Dec. 17, making it the unofficial sign of Holiday Shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some likened it to the 2006 news that Pluto -- long considered the smallest, cutest planet -- was being reclassified as a dwarf planet. ''First we were told that Pluto is not a planet, now there's a new zodiac sign, Ophiuchus,'' read one tweet from someone with the handle HarryPotterish. ''My childhood was a bloody lie.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Duvendack, a St. Louis astrologer on the board of the Astrological Association of St. Louis, said he had been inundated with questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a lot of damage control,'' said Mr. Duvendack, fielding questions from shaken clients. ''I'm having to reassure them that this is all factored into astrology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all that, Mr. Brezsny and others said their craft would survive the confusion -- and the skeptics -- if only because its adherents are so passionate. ''Astrology is a poetic language of the soul, not a scientific method,'' he said, likening it to ''a Neruda poem, Kandinsky paintings or a Nick Cave song.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of those things are rational or scientific,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone was upset with the news of the supposed star shift. Mr. Duvendack said he had at least one astrology buff respond happily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A woman who told me she'd always felt there were one or two traits about Sagittarius that didn't fit her personality,'' Mr. Duvendack said. ''But that the new sign is spot on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRAWINGS: DRAWING (DRAWING BY CHRISTOPHER BRAND AND OLIVER MUNDAY) (A11); Changing Direction: The Earth wobbles, much as a spinning top wobbles, and as it does, the North Pole points to a different part of night sky. That shifts the position of all the stars, including the constellations that make up the astrological zodiac. Over a period of about 26,000 years, the changing North Pole, currently aimed at the star Polaris, traces out a circle in the night sky. Some 23,000 years from now, the sky will be more or less back to where it was when the Babylonians devised the astrological signs. (Source: University of Oregon) (A16)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years ago this month, Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, spotted an object in the night sky that was so bright and so far away that he was sure it was bigger than Pluto.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Guaranteed,'' Dr. Brown said when he announced the discovery, half a year later, in July 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well...maybe not, after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, that object, now known as the dwarf planet Eris, passed in front of a dim, distant star. Astronomers led by Bruno Sicardy of the Paris Observatory measured how long the star disappeared behind Eris and, from that, calculated the width of Eris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clearly smaller,'' said Alain Maury, who observed the brief disappearance, or occultation, of the star at the San Pedro de Atacama Celestial Explorations Observatory in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Drs. Maury and Sicardy decline to say exactly how small Eris is, because they first want to publish the results in the journal Nature. But they say that even accounting for the uncertainties in the observations, the largest possible Eris is smaller than the smallest possible Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news raises the question of what might have happened if Eris' true size had been known from the beginning. Dr. Brown's discovery of Eris -- and the presumption that it was bigger than Pluto -- was the falling domino that pushed the International Astronomical Union to come up with a new definition of ''planet'' that excluded Pluto. Pluto and Eris were downsized to ''dwarf planets'' -- roundish objects that do not gravitationally dominate their orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronomers had believed Pluto to be larger than Eris -- even slightly -- might they have kept the solar system at nine planets and sidestepped the ensuing kerfuffle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe,'' Dr. Brown said, although as he tells in his unapologetically titled book ''How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,'' he thinks the International Astronomical Union got it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The occultation measurement -- which means Eris is not just smaller than expected but also incredibly shiny -- is the latest surprise of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris beyond Neptune. That belt turns out to be even stranger than astronomers thought a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not everyone is yet convinced that Eris is definitely smaller than Pluto. Dr. Brown, for one, is perplexed. The occultation measurement seems to demonstrate convincingly that Eris' diameter is less than 2,360 kilometers, or 1,466 miles, Dr. Brown said. That is smaller than earlier estimates of 3,000 kilometers, based on infrared light from Eris, and 2,400 kilometers, based on Dr. Brown's observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he notes that a number of conflicting figures for the size of Pluto appear on various Web sites. Wikipedia, citing a 2006 scientific paper, puts the diameter at 2,306 kilometers, give or take 20 kilometers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now Pluto is bigger than Eris, ''because, um, 2,306 kilometers is greater than 2,360 kilometers?'' Dr. Brown asked, rhetorically and quizzically, on his blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delving further to make sense of the numbers, Dr. Brown did not question the yet-to-be-published Eris measurements by Dr. Sicardy's group, but rather concluded, ''I have to say: there is something fishy in the size of Pluto.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 80 years after Clyde W. Tombaugh spotted Pluto, astronomers still have not pinned down exactly how big, or small, it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Pluto was the magically shrinking planet. It was first thought to be about as large as Earth -- nearly 8,000 miles wide -- but subsequent measurements had it smaller and smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1980, Alexander J. Dessler, now at Texas A&amp;M University, and Christopher T. Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, published a graph of the mass estimates through the years and jokingly predicted that Pluto would disappear entirely in 1984. ''Those of you interested in observing Pluto should hurry,'' they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, the size of Pluto stabilized. Between 1985 and 1990, the orbit of Pluto's moon, Charon, was edge-on, as seen from Earth, and eclipses enabled astronomers to measure the diameters of Pluto and Charon more directly. Pluto has also passed in front of a few stars, too, just as Eris did in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was still not the end of the story. The surface of Pluto can reach a relatively balmy minus 360 degrees Fahrenheit, warm enough for some methane and nitrogen ices to evaporate and create an atmosphere, and the atmosphere bends light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pluto's atmosphere is kind of a like a crummy convergent lens,'' said Eliot F. Young, an astronomer at <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s space studies department in Boulder, Colo., who was an author of the 2006 paper. ''Each ray is bent toward the center of Pluto.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, the true diameter of Pluto remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Young reanalyzed the stellar occultation data and found Pluto to be bigger, with the data compatible with a diameter as large as 2,400 kilometers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said, ''I don't think it's that big.'' The minimum diameter, according to his calculations, is about 2,300 kilometers, leaving a sizable uncertainty of 100 kilometers. ''This is embarrassing for me to talk about,'' Dr. Young said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris is about three times as far from the Sun as Pluto, much colder and almost completely devoid of any atmosphere to distort an occultation. So astronomers may now know Eris' size more accurately than Pluto's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the range of possible Pluto sizes seems to overlap the possible Eris sizes. ''If you looked at the two of them right next to each other sitting in space, they would look to be exactly the same size,'' Dr. Brown said. ''You couldn't tell by eye until you took out your really, really big ruler.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drs. Maury and Sicardy point to another estimate that finds a larger Pluto, based on the absorption of light by methane in Pluto's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That analysis, by Emmanuel Lellouch of the Paris Observatory, and his collaborators, who included Dr. Sicardy, said that to explain the patterns they saw, Pluto had to be at least 2,340 kilometers wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Young, while lauding the methane measurements, said that too much was still not known about the structure of Pluto's atmosphere to make that confident a conclusion about its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A precise, direct measurement of Pluto will finally come in 2015 when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is to fly past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smaller size of Eris would actually make it more interesting, Dr. Brown said. With less surface area, it would have to reflect almost all the light that hits it to explain how bright it is. And to explain the shininess, it must have a thin layer of methane and nitrogen frost -- the remnants of a thin atmosphere that froze as Eris moved along its elliptical orbit away from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no other plausible explanation,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris is currently almost nine billion miles from the Sun, but its elliptical, 557-year orbit takes it as close as 3.5 billion miles. Pluto's distance from the Sun varies between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, it is still the heavyweight of the Kuiper Belt -- 27 percent more massive than Pluto. The orbital period of Charon put a precise figure on Pluto's mass, and Eris' mass is similarly well measured because it too has a moon, named Dysnomia. That means Eris must have a much larger rocky core than Pluto, perhaps indicating that Pluto and Eris did not form in quite the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Kuiper Belt objects that Dr. Brown has discovered in the past decade have also shown the outer system to be more curious -- and violent -- than many would have expected. One of those is Haumea, a dwarf planet that is highly elongated and spins very fast, once every four hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only thing we could think that would cause it is if it got smacked, really hard, by something else early in the history of the solar system,'' Dr. Brown said, ''and everyone kind shook their head and said, well, no, that makes no sense, the probability of that happening is nearly zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Dr. Brown and his collaborators discovered two moons orbiting Haumea that looked like shards knocked off by an impact. Still, the skeptics doubted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, they found a dozen more pieces of Haumea, orbiting not around Haumea but around the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point, there is no question this thing suffered a giant impact,'' Dr. Brown said. ''I think we should have called it Humpty Dumpty instead of Haumea -- we can actually put this thing back together again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large Kuiper Belt objects also have tiny fragment moons, suggesting that giant impacts were not uncommon. Many of them are also rockier than expected; impacts could have knocked away outer layers of ice. Indeed, a giant, high-speed impact in Eris' past could be the reason it has less ice and more rock than Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent measurements indicate that the other large Kuiper Belt objects are also, like Eris, smaller and shinier than had been thought. The one known as Makemake now appears to be only 1,200 kilometers in diameter, not 1,500. Another, Quaoar, might be only 900 kilometers wide, compared with earlier estimates of 1,200 kilometers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves a sizable gap between Pluto and Eris and the next largest ones. ''It's a really strange distribution of sizes,'' Dr. Brown said. ''I don't think it's caught anybody's attention yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise since the discovery of Eris is that there has not been another Eris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown's sweep of the Kuiper Belt turned up a series of larger and larger objects -- up to Eris. After Eris, the search found nothing else of note. There was a possibility of another large Kuiper Belt object lurking in the Southern Hemisphere sky, out of view of the California telescope that Dr. Brown was using.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Scott S. Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution of Washington just completed a survey of the remaining sky, and he, too, found nothing large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is highly unlikely there are other Pluto-size objects'' in the Kuiper Belt, Dr. Sheppard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the Kuiper Belt, more mysteries await.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers want to find more objects like Sedna, which Dr. Brown discovered in 2003. Sedna is currently about three times as far from the Sun as Neptune, which is already outside of the Kuiper Belt. But at the other end of its 11,800-year elliptical orbit, Sedna will be 32 times as far out as Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And beyond Sedna is the Oort cloud, an even more distant collection of bodies astronomers have not yet found, but which they are absolutely certain exist. (Some of the comets that pass by the Sun originated in the Oort cloud but were gravitationally nudged to dive toward the inner solar system.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one of those more distant objects could turn out to be larger than one or more of the remaining eight planets, which could reignite the debate over what should be called a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could help resolve a sore point in the Brown household.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown originally wanted to name Eris after his daughter, Lilah, who was born three weeks before the discovery was announced. He imagined that when someone asked, ''Were you named after the planet?'' Lilah could retort, ''No, the planet was named after me.'' His wife, Diane, dissuaded him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown eventually settled on Eris, the Greek goddess of strife. Dysnomia, the moon, is a demon of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. Dr. Brown also chose that name because the first syllable is pronounced like the first syllable of Diane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilah, now in kindergarten, is one of the people upset with her father over Pluto. ''Killing is bad, and she knows I killed Pluto and therefore I'm a bad person,'' Dr. Brown said. ''And she would like me to do something about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown explained to Lilah why Pluto was no longer a planet. ''And she's fine with that,'' he said. ''She has a solution, which is an interestingly creative solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilah told him, ''Why don't you find another planet and name it Pluto?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's why I keep looking,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilah still does not know she almost had a planet named after her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 19, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Jan. 11 about uncertainty surrounding the sizes of Pluto and the dwarf planet Eris misstated an estimate of Pluto's diameter by scientists at the Paris Observatory. They concluded it is at least 2,340 kilometers wide, not at least 2,360 kilometers wide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- In a down payment on riches to come, scientists from NASA's Kepler satellite announced Monday that they had discovered the smallest planet yet found outside our solar system and the first that was unquestionably rocky, like the Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as Kepler 10b, is only 40 percent larger than the Earth and about 4.6 times as massive, making it about as dense as Mercury. It is lethally hot, orbiting its star in 20 hours at a distance only one-twentieth of that of Mercury from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's a scorched world,'' said Natalie Batalha of San Jose State University, the member of the Kepler team who directed the study of the planet. She reported her findings at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society here and in a paper submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five hundred exoplanets, as planets around other stars are called, have been detected over the last 15 years. A vast majority of them are Jupiter-size giants, but as techniques have improved, astronomers have been able to detect smaller and smaller planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, a veteran exoplanet hunter and a member of the Kepler team, called the new planet a ''planetary missing link'' between those hot giants and the Earth-size habitable planets that astronomers hope Kepler and other space projects will uncover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's announcement, he said, ''I believe will be marked as among the most profound in human history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in 2009, searches for exoplanets by staring at 150,000 stars in a patch of sky between Cygnus and Lyra constellations, looking for dips in brightness caused by the passage of a planet in front of its home star. The goal is to find Earth-size planets in habitable orbits, meaning that liquid water can exist on their surfaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler 10b planet showed up early in the commissioning of the satellite after its launching. The Kepler astronomers could measure the planet's radius by the silhouette it cut in the star's light, and its mass by painstaking spectroscopic measurements made with the mighty Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii that showed by how much the planet's gravity was tugging its star back and forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 10b's star is 560 light-years away and about eight billion years old. Dr. Batalha noted that when the light received by Kepler left that star, Europeans were beginning to embark on the great ocean voyages of discovery, ''looking for new horizons.'' We are doing the same thing, she went on: ''Our crow's nest is a spacecraft called Kepler.''</p>

Computers are of only limited use in this work, so the planetarium is enlisting thousands of volunteers with little scientific training to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Adler has become a leader in ''citizen science,'' a growing trend in astronomy research. As the lead institution of the Citizen Science Alliance, which includes Oxford and Johns Hopkins Universities, it has registered more than 350,000 non-experts to help classify the many thousands of pictures of galaxies taken by powerful telescopes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images can help researchers better identify the shapes of galaxies, observe the formation of stars and follow the movement of asteroids. Astronomers often use computers to help analyze photos of outer space, but computers can miss anomalies and patterns that the human eye is particularly equipped to catch, said Joshua Frieman, a researcher at FermiLab and a professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't need a lot of detailed astronomical training to be able to look at these images and answer certain basic questions about them,'' Professor Frieman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, astronomers had assumed red galaxies were elliptical, but volunteers recently identified many of them as spirals. The amateurs' observations have also helped scientists predict when solar magnetic storms, which often interfere with telecommunication satellites, will hit Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volunteers anywhere in the world can register online to view photos on their Web browsers, and send their observations to researchers at the planetarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've found a meaningful way that somebody who doesn't have a Ph.D. in astronomy can actually work with astronomers collecting and analyzing data,'' said Paul H. Knappenberger Jr., president of the Adler Planetarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium is an ideal place for this kind of collaboration, Mr. Lintott said, because it is one of the few space museums in the world where educators and astronomers conduct research side by side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lintott said the project had the same image analyzed by dozens of observers, many of them high school or college students, to ensure accuracy. He found that a large group of volunteers could often turn up more accurate results quicker than a small group of scientists working with the same set of images. Astronomers review the data and then share it with institutions around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum and other Chicago museums have previously combined advanced research with public education initiatives. Citizen science gained a foothold here when the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum began enlisting local residents to record sightings of squirrels for researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knappenberger said he expected Chicago's lead in citizen science to attract researchers from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is how a lot of science research will get done in the future,'' he said, ''and we'll be in a position to get those projects up and running.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ambitious $1.6 billion spacecraft that would investigate the mysterious force that is apparently accelerating the expansion of the universe -- and search out planets around other stars, to boot -- might have to be postponed for a decade, NASA says, because of cost overruns and mismanagement on a separate project, the James Webb Space Telescope. The news has dismayed many American astronomers, who worry they will wind up playing second fiddle to their European counterparts in what they say is the deepest mystery in the universe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many things can we do in our lifetime that will excite a generation of scientists?'' asked Saul Perlmutter, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is one of dark energy's discoverers. There is a sense, he said, ''that we're starting to give up leadership in these important areas in fundamental physics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, after 10 years of debate and interagency wrangling, a prestigious committee from the National Academy of Sciences gave highest priority among big space projects in the coming decade to a satellite telescope that would take precise measure of dark energy, as it is known, and also look for planets beyond our solar system. The proposed project goes by the slightly unwieldy acronym Wfirst, for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Academy's report was ambushed by NASA's announcement in November that the successor to the Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope, which had been scheduled for a 2014 launching, would require at least another $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, pushing the next big mission to 2022 at the very earliest. The Webb will search out the first stars and galaxies to have formed in the universe, but is not designed for dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To take up the slack until 2025 -- or whenever the American mission can finally fly -- the space agency has proposed buying a 20 percent share in a European dark-energy mission known as Euclid that could fly as soon as 2018. In return, NASA would ask for a similar investment by Europe in Wfirst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, said Dr. Perlmutter, ''most of us think it is hard to imagine if we do Euclid now that we will do a dark-energy mission then.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who heads a committee that advises NASA on astrophysics, said: ''If Euclid goes ahead, they're going to own the field. There's no way the U.S. can stop them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the American astronomers' worries about falling behind seemed to be validated by a second Academy panel convened to consider the Euclid option. The panelists pointed out that part of the reason that Wfirst had been given such high priority was that it could be launched sooner rather than later. The panel urged NASA to stay the course or to explore merging Wfirst and Euclid in a joint operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody agrees that nothing is cast in stone yet. Euclid must survive a bake-off with two other projects before it is approved by the European Space Agency, or E.S.A. Not until then, European astronomers say, will they be able to talk about changes to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not said how it plans to get the $1.6 billion it needs to finish the Webb telescope, and thus how much will be left for other projects this decade. Some of the answers will be in the 2012 NASA budget due next month. ''Fitting the E.S.A. and NASA processes together at this stage would be a challenge, but the scientific benefits are clear,'' according to the new report by the Academy, which was delivered in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, director of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, said in an interview that NASA was committed to carrying out the recommendations of the original Academy survey that endorsed Wfirst. It is the ''sense of Congress,'' he said, that the Academy ''should guide NASA science programs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about worries that Euclid could give the Europeans a big leg up in dark-energy work, Dr. Morse said, ''The Europeans have developed a significant capability for doing their own missions.'' ''The scientific return for their investment has been outstanding,'' Dr. Morse said, adding that European astronomers are looking for ''frontier scientific discoveries'' to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark energy certainly counts as frontier science. The discovery a decade ago that the universe is speeding up, in defiance of common sense or cosmic gravity, has thrown into doubt notions about the fate of the universe and of life within it, not to mention gravity and even the nature of the laws of physics. It is as if, when you dropped your car keys, they shot up to the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists have one ready-made explanation for this behavior, but it is a cure that many of them think is worse than the disease: a fudge factor invented by Einstein in 1917 called the cosmological constant. He suggested, and quantum theory has subsequently confirmed, that empty space could exert a repulsive force, blowing things apart. But the best calculations predict an effect 10 to the exponent of 120 times greater than what astronomers have measured, causing physicists to metaphorically tear their hair out and mutter about multiple universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers who made this discovery were using the exploding stars known as Type 1a supernovae as cosmic distance markers to track the expansion rate of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, other tools have emerged by which astronomers can also gauge dark energy by how it retards the growth of galaxies and other structures in the universe. So far the observations are consistent with it being Einstein's constant, but not definitive; more precise measurements, many of which can only be done from space, are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perlmutter, who works in the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, proposed a dark energy mission known as SNAP (Supernova Acceleration Probe) in 1999. In 2003, the White House asked the Energy Department to partner with NASA on the project, which became known as JDEM, for Joint Dark Energy Mission, and a call went out for competing proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA and the Energy Department found it hard to collaborate, and several rounds of meetings and committees went nowhere. ''Maybe we shouldn't have tried to ride two horses,'' Dr. Perlmutter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, NASA and the Energy Department budgeted $600 million, not including launching costs, for a mission, but a working group of dark-energy scientists could not come up with a design that would fit in the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling that the blessing of the National Academy of Sciences was needed to proceed with a more expensive project, Dr. Morse submitted a couple of versions of the dark energy mission to the Academy panel -- also known as Astro2010 -- that was charged with setting priorities for the astronomical community for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories, who led one of the panel's subcommittees, noticed that three of the submitted projects -- including dark energy, a search for planets around other stars, dubbed exoplanets, and a survey of infrared radiation from the heavens -- all required the same hardware. He proposed combining them into a larger mission (''putting more eggs into the basket,'' in Dr. Perlmutter's words), in a project that could launch around 2020. That larger mission they dubbed Wfirst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked then and it still looks to me like a good deal,'' said Roger Blandford of Stanford, an astrophysicist and the chairman of the Astro2010 panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the European Space Agency had also made dark energy a priority. Last February, the Europeans sent NASA a letter offering the Americans a 20 percent piece of Euclid and two slots on the mission's science team. American astronomers were ambivalent. Joining Euclid would divert resources from their own mission, thus delaying it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September NASA's advisory committee on astrophysics, which is led by Dr. Boss of the Carnegie Institution, concluded that Euclid could spend three or four years ''skimming the cream off the dark energy pail'' before Wfirst got into the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Dr. Boss's council and yet another committee, the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee, which counsels the National Science Foundation and Energy Department as well as NASA, concluded that joining Euclid was not in keeping with the original Academy recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the second Academy panel reported in December, the news about the Webb telescope's problems had made everything worse. The Webb, which was the highest Academy priority 10 years ago and has already cost $5 billion, could not be launched any earlier than 2015 and would probably be even later, because of NASA's inability to correctly estimate how long it would take to do things like test the telescope. How much of the $2.2 billion that NASA was to have available for new astrophysics missions this decade will be left once Webb is taken care of is anybody's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, NASA faces what Dr. Morse calls ''an evolved difficult fiscal environment,'' with Republicans bent on reducing the federal budget taking over the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers said they felt ambushed by NASA and Dr. Morse, who briefed the Astro2010 panel during its two years of deliberations. ''He didn't know? He should be fired,'' said Dr. Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morse said he understood and shared his colleagues' frustration. But said he had warned the panel all along that its plans could be upset by the Webb, which has always been known to have problems. ''The community,'' he said, referring to the Astro2010 panel, ''did the best job they could with what they were given. The fiscal constraints are far worse now than we could imagine a year ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, as Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and a member of Astro2010, put it, ''We're in a terrible mess.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, NASA solicited proposals from astronomers who want to join Euclid and named a team that will begin meeting in February to begin planning Wfirst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem with Euclid from the Academy point of view is that it does not include observations of supernovae, the technique by which dark energy was discovered. Nor does the United States play a leadership role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss, however, speaking personally, said he worried that those recommendations were out of date with new realities -- budget and otherwise -- and that following them could keep the United States out of what might be the only dark-energy mission for some time. ''It's time for some creative thought,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The European Union is producing more papers per year than the U.S.,'' Dr. Boss went on. ''They passed us a year ago and are doing quite well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Blandford, the chairman of the original Academy panel, agreed. ''Dark energy and exoplanets are both fields of tremendous scientific importance and have caught the public's attention,'' he said. ''In both cases, the U.S. is currently the leading contributor. To abdicate that investment and opportunity would seem a terrible shame, but it doesn't mean we have to see Europeans as enemies we have to vanquish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perlmutter, one of the discoverers of dark energy, sounded a similar note. ''What's sad here is that everybody's been trying hard, there are no villains,'' he said. ''We all feel it is important to be at the table. At the end of the day we're scientists, you want to see science done.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Why It Had It Coming</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mike Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">267 pp. Spiegel &amp; Grau. $25</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union voted to ax Pluto from our solar system's pantheon of planets, rechristening it a ''dwarf planet.'' The ballot took place because Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, had detected a potential 10th planet, and the union had to decide how to categorize it. Admit the object to the roster and you pave the way for a solar system with over 100 planets. (Astronomers expect the Kuiper belt, the region beyond Neptune where the potential planet was found, to contain many similar objects.) Exclude it and you must also banish Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I expected this vote, which took place in Prague, to be the most memorable section of Brown's ''How I Killed Pluto.'' Or else the moment when after sifting through thousands of telescopic images, he first discerned the moving object -- ''planet'' means ''wanderer'' -- that triggered the I.A.U.'s vote. Oddly, though, what stuck with me was the scene in which Brown groggily dumped cat litter instead of detergent into his washing machine, exhausted not from nights peering through high-powered telescopes at Palomar Mountain or Mauna Kea but from waking up to feed his newborn daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How I Killed Pluto'' is a strange artifact, an unlikely hybrid of Dennis Overbye's ''Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos'' and Anne Lamott's ''Operating Instructions.'' It's not a book about the former ninth planet -- or even planetary astronomy -- lightly salted with Brown's family life. A good bit of it chronicles infant development, even including some of Brown's blog posts about his daughter's eating and sleeping habits during the first 240 days after her birth. ''If you examine all non-bottle feeds between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.,'' one entry informs us, ''the average interval between feeds is 2 hours 39 minutes. If you examine the same bottle feeds you find an average of 2 hours 28 minutes between feeds. Hmmm. Eleven whole minutes. . . . Me and a bottle are almost as good as the real thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach has a strength: Brown opens the emotional life of an actual scientist to the reader, belying the myth that he and his colleagues are automatons. But it also has a weakness: readers swept along by the thrill of a gigantic story -- the discovery of a potential new planet -- can be stopped by irrelevancies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown is most successful when he's describing his work as an astronomer, revealing the way planning and luck combined in his discovery of at least three big objects orbiting our sun. One Thanksgiving in the late 1990s, prevented by fog from using the 200-inch Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory, he decided to check out the 48-inch Schmidt telescope instead. Because this telescope used analog technology, Brown viewed it as a ''fossil.'' But then he realized: old-fashioned photography beats digital imaging at capturing large sweeps of the sky, making it ideal for mapping big areas where a new planet was likely to lurk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the technology was daunting. ''The last time I had touched real film,'' he writes, ''was when I was in third grade and my father and I had built a little darkroom.'' Worse, the Schmidt photographic plates were so sensitive to red light that they could be developed only in total darkness. Happily, though, on that fateful night he met a Schmidt veteran, an expert in the ancient technology who was thrilled when Brown suggested using the telescope to map a new part of the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planet hunting is not for the lazy or the easily distracted. After his team made thousands of images, Brown had to write software to detect objects that moved, then correct for photographic distortions and imperfections. When he tells of finding, against great odds, a bright object that ''might well be a planet,'' the reader shares his excitement as well as his proprietary feelings. And when a Spanish astronomer, tipped off by online observatory records, claims credit for the discovery, the reader also shares his indignation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quest for new planets is inevitably also a quest for fame. But as the I.A.U. considered adding Brown's potential 10th planet to the list, he made it clear that science must trump celebrity: ''The idea that astronomers would actively encourage people to have the wrong view of the solar system seemed almost criminal. The idea that I was going to, overnight, become one of the most famous astronomers in the world on account of this criminal activity made me a passive accomplice. I had to do something to stop it.'' Voting was not an option: Brown had never joined the I.A.U. (''I can't get myself to fill out the paperwork,'' he explains.) So from his mother-in-law's house in the Pacific Northwest, he rang Caltech's press office and began a successful campaign to demote Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps because Brown has a daughter, ''Why I Killed Pluto'' addresses gender discrimination in the sciences. In the early 20th century, when the Palomar Mountain observatories were built, they included sleeping quarters called the Monastery that, like the telescopes themselves, were off limits to women. Decades later, space science was no more integrated, particularly at NASA's Marshall space center, where Brown's father worked on Project Apollo. Growing up, Brown recalls, ''you became a rocket engineer if you were a boy and you married a rocket engineer if you were a girl.'' ''Even today,'' he observes at the scene of a Caltech dinner party, ''things remain frighteningly skewed.'' Nearly all the men at the table are scientists; nearly all their wives are not. But he has hope: ''Most of my graduate students in recent years have been female. Times have no choice but to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I admire Brown's concern with gender equity, but when I read his descriptions of baby care, I couldn't help wondering: Would a woman astronomer be taken seriously if so much of her book on planet-hunting also detailed her infant's first months?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON Friday a time machine will land on the stage of the Abrons Arts Center. The crew -- an astronaut, a squishy space alien and a cyborg with a mustache -- will try to transport audience members to the future, saving them from ''an event so potent it turned this entire planet into a grave.'' Unfortunately this future features endless copulation and meals salvaged from one's own bodily waste. To get there, spectators will first have to survive goofy costumes, low-tech special effects, alien mucus sacs and at least one appalling dance number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Annihilation Point,'' a spoofy piece of lo-fi sci-fi from the Berserker Residents, a Philadelphia company committed to producing fantastical shows, is the latest example in the current surge of science fiction in the theater. Though playwrights as varied as Karel Capek, George Bernard Shaw, Sam Shepard and Caryl Churchill have composed plays in the genre, these scripts are staged rarely, and new ones usually arrive just as infrequently.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last 12 months New York audiences have enjoyed Jay Scheib's ''Bellona, Destroyer of Cities,'' a version of Samuel R. Delany's punk dystopia ''Dhalgren,'' the Mad Ones' ''Samuel and Alasdair: A Personal History of the Robot War,'' Wakka Wakka's ''Baby Universe: A Puppet Odyssey,'' and new adaptations of Ed Wood's film ''Plan 9 From Outer Space'' and Philip K. Dick's novel ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And perhaps you've heard of a little show derived from some Spider-Man comics?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The novelist Isaac Asimov once defined science fiction as art contending with ''something that is not yet so.'' And while drama is the original virtual reality, an everyday exemplar of an alternative universe, sci-fi stories have made their way onto the stage far less often than into books or movies. Even though the surrealists and absurdists and symbolists have long since shown us that anything is possible onstage, most playwrights and directors prefer to hew to the laws of time, gravity and thermodynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheib, an associate professor of theater arts at M.I.T. whose stage work limns space travel and parallel worlds, wonders if theater's classical origins have inhibited such exploration. ''When you have a really hard-core tradition of unities of time and place and action, it's hard to imagine slippages of time, for instance,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others cite the constraints of the playing area and the budget. ''There's a limit to what you can do,'' said Tim Sawicki, the author of ''The Annihilation Point.'' The stage, he said, ''can't deliver a lot of science-fiction staples -- space, crazy robotics, mutant superpowers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Rothenberg, the show's director, added: ''Theater is so fundamentally low-tech. Most theater is made out of wood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore Frank Cwiklik, who directed the stage version of the Ed Wood film, said that ''some artistic directors are resistant to anything that could be seen as gimmicky or lowbrow, and lump science fiction in with that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these challenges, science fiction plays -- some defiantly silly, some yearningly serious -- are appearing more often. Lejla Kucukalic, a Columbia University professor who lectures on science fiction, hypothesized that ''the increased presence of technology, media and science in our daily lives'' may help to explain this uptick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Science fiction, no matter what form it takes, allows the artist to explore alternative forms of world and character building, often for the purpose of social critique and as often to entertain and dazzle,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Way back in 1921 Capek, a Czech playwright, introduced the word ''robot'' to the language in his drama ''R.U.R.,'' and playwrights since -- especially those with a debt to Mr. Dick and Mr. Delany -- have explored contemporary issues of identity, community and the relationship between humans and machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A play set in an alternate universe ''gives you great freedom to think about where you are now without the pressure of having to be so literal,'' Mr. Scheib said. Or, as with ''The Annihilation Point,'' it's merely a great excuse for some wonderfully inane Buck Rogers flashbacks -- camp for straight guys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annie Dorsen, a director whose ''Hello Hi There,'' a piece in which two computers converse with each other, opens at Performance Space 122 on Thursday, said that contemporary theater makers ought to engage directly with the technological revolution. ''We as artists should be jumping in with both feet,'' she said, ''sometimes brilliantly, sometimes stupidly, sometimes overenthusiastically -- responding to it and not retreating from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once artists decide to explore science fiction, challenges await them. Many practitioners spoke of feeling compelled to ramp up their visual capabilities (set, lighting, costumes, effects) before embarking on a science fiction play, and of encountering a disparity between their desires and their abilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwendolyn Warnock, one of the creators of ''Baby Universe,'' a poignant puppet play inspired by Stephen Hawking's theoretical physics, said the new piece required the company to extend itself technically. ''We incorporated projection for the first time, so that we could leap off to the clouds or into the stars, and we used a lot of small practical lights so that we could create the space station,'' she explained. ''And then we used pyrotechnics because we needed our own Big Bang.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Curnutte, one of the Mad Ones, a company with the tag line ''Up with robots, down with people,'' said that he and his colleagues would joke wistfully about how they'd stage their play with unlimited finances: ''We'd say, 'Oh, this is the moment where a robot hand comes crashing through the ceiling of the Winter Garden,' but obviously we weren't really going to do that at a 50-seat house in Williamsburg. So you had to just hear that robot through the walls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies, like the Berserker Residents, take a more playful approach to the genre and celebrate a deliberately low-budget aesthetic. ''Our particular brand of sci-fi is very comic, goofy, irreverent, slapdash,'' Mr. Sawicki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That the effects are done with glue and string and cardboard is part of the fun,'' Mr. Rothenberg added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on the cheap, plays that want to take audiences to other times and places -- especially, say, if they require costumes based on candy-colored holograms, as Mr. Scheib's ''Bellona'' does -- are always going to be harder to realize than your standard living-room drama. In New York many have been conceived by gonzo theater groups rather than single playwrights, and they often arrive in offbeat spaces. But their creators argue that they allow for important thematic possibilities -- or at least the opportunity to don some nifty space boots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if, as in ''The Annihilation Point,'' a piece of sci-fi onstage also promises to save an entire audience from cosmic extinction, well -- everyone into the time machine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hanny van Arkel had been using the Galaxy Zoo Web site less than a week when she noticed something odd about the photograph of IC 2497, a minor galaxy in the Leo Minor constellation. ''It was this strange thing,'' she recalled: an enormous gas cloud, floating like a ghost in front of the spiral galaxy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dutch schoolteacher with no formal training in astronomy, Ms. van Arkel had joined tens of thousands of other Web volunteers to help classify photographs taken by deep-space telescopes. Stumped by the unusual image on her computer screen, she e-mailed the project staff for guidance. Staff members were stumped, too. And thus was christened the celestial body now known to astronomers worldwide as Hanny's Voorwerp (Dutch for ''object'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories like Ms. van Arkel's are becoming more common, as the Internet opens up new opportunities for so-called citizen scientists. And as millions of people get involved in these participatory projects, scientists are grappling with how best to harness the amateurs' enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics argue that citizen science projects are often little more than ploys to stimulate public interest rather than advance scientific knowledge. Others fret over the quality of data generated by nonspecialists. But scientists must weigh such risks against the benefits of a powerful new research tool: a vast computer network that can parcel out complex projects into small tasks that can be completed by individuals with relatively limited training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many got their first taste of citizen science with SETI@Home, which enlisted more than five million users in the search for signs of extraterrestrial life. Volunteers downloaded a program that used their computers' idle processing cycles to sift through data from radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of SETI@Home has inspired a number of other grid-computing initiatives, like Grid Republic, a consortium of more than 50 projects relying on the same screensaver-based software, and IBM's World Community Grid, which is being used by Chinese researchers to investigate efficient water-filtering techniques using nanotubes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now researchers are starting to look for ways to engage contributors in more substantive ways, taking advantage of what the Internet pundit Clay Shirky calls the ''cognitive surplus'' of online brainpower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Galaxy Zoo, the Herbaria@home project turns users into volunteer taxonomists, classifying images from collections of herbarium specimens across Britain. To date, the site's 284 registered users have cataloged more than 75,000 specimens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other citizen science projects enlist users as data gatherers, inviting them to contribute field observations about meteorological data, wildlife behavior and other phenomena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cornell University's Nestwatch provides a platform for amateur ornithologists to share observations about the nesting habits of bird species across North America. Recently, organizers have focused on tracking the effects of the BPoil spill on local birds' nesting patterns. And Australia's ClimateWatch project invites users to track seasonal variations in plant and animal life cycles across the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the open-door participation policies, project administrators face major challenges in ensuring the integrity of their data. Staff members at Herbaria@home perform manual quality checks on about 5 percent of the incoming data, while ClimateWatch uses an algorithm to look for unusual data points, which can then be manually checked for accuracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quality control aside, a larger question remains: Does the act of data gathering really constitute science?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people are not doing the work of scientists,'' said David Weinberger, a senior researcher at the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society at Harvard, who is writing a book about the changing shape of human knowledge in the online era. ''They are doing the work of scientific instruments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Emmott, head of computational research at Microsoft Research, agrees that most citizen science projects tend to treat participants as high-functioning cogs in a distributed machine. ''Certainly this is participatory,'' he said, ''but is it science?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Emmott believes that before Web users can claim the mantle of citizen scientists, they will have to be given more meaningful roles. ''Participants should be able to make a genuine contribution,'' he said, ''and get something back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Emmott's team is exploring new models that would involve users in the research process without compromising academic rigor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other researchers are looking to tap the higher brain functions of Web users. Foldit turns protein research into a game, offering Web users a puzzle in the form of a multicolored knot of spirals and clumps. Each puzzle represents a sequence of amino acids, which the user tries to fold into the most efficient shape possible. By combining computational algorithms with the visual problem-solving skills of more than 100,000 Web users, the researchers hope to pioneer a new approach to solving computational problems using supplemental human brain power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some researchers are focused on expanding the contributions of average Web users, others want to cultivate people who already have some level of scientific training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">InnoCentive offers an online marketplace where organizations can pose problems to a network of more than 200,000 ''solvers'' who compete for cash rewards for the best solution. Recent InnoCentive contests include a $1 million prize for a biomarker to measure the progression of Lou Gehrig's disease, as well as a $7,500 prize for better-smelling cat litter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other citizen science projects are taking shape at the grassroots level. DIYBio is a two-year-old organization with more than 1,500 members interested in conducting their own collaborative science projects. The organization has now spawned three physical lab spaces in Boston, Brooklyn and San Francisco , where members can participate in projects with polymerase chain reaction tests, centrifuges and DNA sequencing equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to get people more involved in hands-on science,'' said Jason Bobe, a founder of DIYBio. Members are exploring opportunities to turn genome sequencing into a game in which participants pull in data from crosswalk buttons and the like to model the spread of micro-organisms in urban environments. In a recent experiment, members collected dollar bills from 50 volunteers, then extracted the DNA for sequencing to identify all the micro-organisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new self-organizing research communities emerge online, the long-term impact of citizen science projects may have less to do with the citizens than with the scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Web users can review research in progress and engage scientists in open discussions, the traditional process of peer review based on the model of academic publishing will face some new challenges. ''It opens up another layer of participation,'' Dr. Weinberger said, ''and that's where the deep impact is felt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, out on the open Web, hundreds of thousands of nonscientists continue to look for opportunities to take part in scientific research, inspired by the example of people like Ms. van Arkel, who has been enjoying the perks of Internet microstardom. She now blogs, maintains a Twitter feed and speaks at conferences and recently took a star turn in her own community-generated comic book. In January, her place in the annals of science will finally be cemented when her name appears as co-author of a scientific paper documenting her discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. van Arkel is under no illusions about her place in the scientific establishment. ''I like to tell people that you can do science without being a scientist,'' she said. ''It's a life-changing thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 29, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about participatory ''citizen science'' projects described incorrectly an online protein-folding game known as Foldit. Each puzzle in the game represents a sequence of amino acids, not a single amino acid.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUITLAND, Md. -- Stashed in a Smithsonian storage building in this Washington suburb are some of the engineering wonders of the space race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These marvels are far smaller than the towering rockets and streamlined spacecraft that took men into orbit and to the Moon. Far softer, too. They are the spacesuits that kept the astronauts alive beyond Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the National Air and Space Museum's collection of about 300 spacesuits is here, laid out five high on steel racks in a climate-controlled room. Each is protected by a sheet of muslin, giving the room the eerie feel of a morgue or the final resting place of members of an odd space cult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are Mercury suits like the one worn by Scott Carpenter, the fourth American in space, its iconic reflective coating coming off in spots. There's the Apollo 11 suit worn by Neil A. Armstrong, looking about as pristine as when he made his first small step on the moon in 1969, thanks to a cleaning job by NASA that, in retrospect, was ill advised because it damaged the materials the suit was made of. Nearby lies Harrison H. Schmitt's Apollo 17 outfit, still heavily coated in lunar grit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many suits that never made it into space, projects like the EX1-A, which had doughnut-shaped joints that allowed the wearer full limb movement; the AX-5, which looks like a space-age version of the Michelin Man; and the AES, which was covered almost entirely in fabric of woven stainless steel. (It looks fabulous and was fabulously expensive.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are accessories, too: lunar booties with the same stainless-steel fabric on top; Manned Orbiting Laboratory gloves with sharkskin palms and sewn-in steel fingernails, so nimble that an astronaut could pick up a dime while wearing them, even when they were pressurized; long johns laced with plastic pipes, to water-cool the wearer; and box after box of headgear, including Mr. Armstrong's gold-visored external helmet, once thought to have been left on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacesuits will get their due next spring, in a traveling exhibition of full-size photographs and X-ray images organized by the Smithsonian. (Most of the suits -- especially their rubber components, which have become brittle over the decades -- are too fragile to be displayed.) Last month, a few of the people who know most about spacesuits gathered at the museum for a panel discussion about the design decisions and trade-offs that went into creating these most personal of space-race artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of it is engineering,'' Joseph J. Kosmo, a senior project engineer with NASA who has designed spacesuits for nearly 50 years, said in an interview. ''But a lot of it is art, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its most basic, a spacesuit is meant to perform two nearly incompatible functions: protect the astronaut from the harsh environment of space, and allow the wearer to maneuver and work comfortably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The emphasis is on trying to develop a very mobile system while pressurized,'' said Mr. Kosmo, who in 1961, fresh out of college with a degree in an aeronautical engineering, was asked if he'd be interested in a job described as working on ''spacesuits, whatever they are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pressure suit -- a rubber bladder and a sealed helmet -- allows the astronaut to survive in the vacuum of space. But a bladder is constricting when unpressurized, and when it is inflated movement becomes even more difficult, because moving the joints reduces the volume, increasing the pressure inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you pressurize it, it's like working inside of a sausage,'' said Joseph P. Kerwin, an astronaut aboard the Skylab mission in 1973 and the Apollo program ''suit guy'' -- the astronaut who worked most closely with spacesuit engineers -- for several years before that. ''The whole trick in designing a spacesuit was to make it easier to move the joints inside that inflated balloon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So engineers, including Mr. Kosmo, spent years using their knowledge of anatomy, movement and materials to develop better joints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doughnut-shaped ones on the EX1-A were a solution -- they are hard joints, so the volume of the suit remains constant when movement occurs, and there is no pressure increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more practical solution, however, turned out to be something called a convolute -- accordionlike folds in the bladder at the shoulders, knees and other joints. With a system of cables to keep the folds from stretching, convolutes provided a good degree of movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first suits, for the solo Mercury flights from 1961 to 1963, were variations on military high-altitude flight suits and were simpler, said Amanda Young, who spent 15 years organizing the museum's suit collection before retiring in 2009. (Aside from a few later prototypes, the collection ends with post-Apollo projects like Skylab; shuttle and space station suits are not yet included.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mercury suits had only two layers -- the pressure bladder and a nylon covering to protect the bladder and help it keep its rough shape when pressurized. (The thin aluminized coating, glued to the nylon, may have been more for show than for thermal protection.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Mercury suits, the bladder was there only for emergencies, like loss of capsule pressure, to enable the astronaut to survive until he could return to Earth. ''All it was was 'get me down' capability,'' Mr. Kosmo said. No such emergency ever occurred, so the suits were never pressurized in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Mercury astronaut was crammed in his capsule, mobility was not an issue. ''You didn't have to go reaching around, you didn't have to get out and walk around,'' Mr. Kosmo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the first spacewalks, in the two-astronaut Gemini flights in the mid-1960s, that changed, said Ms. Young, the author of ''Spacesuits,'' a book about the museum's collection. ''The suits had a totally different construction,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides requiring that the suits be pressurized, going outside the spacecraft exposed the astronaut to micrometeoroids -- high-speed particles that could puncture a spacesuit -- and to extremes of heat and cold. So more layers, of Dacron, Mylar and other polymer materials, were added to protect and insulate the astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other common-sense changes were made, too, Ms. Young said. ''They learned that you had to put a flap over the zipper in the back, because if you turned your back to the sun the zipper would heat up,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when astronauts tried to do work, they quickly overheated. Air-cooling was inadequate, Mr. Kosmo said, and the idea of water-cooled underwear was developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long johns were a big success during the Apollo program, Mr. Kerwin said, describing a conversation he had with Alan Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon. Mr. Bean was cavorting about and began to overheat, so he turned the knob on his coolant backpack from low to medium. The result, he told Mr. Kerwin, was ''like diving into a swimming pool -- you felt that cold on your body right away.'' No one ever tried the high setting, Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its moon walks, the Apollo program placed other demands on suit designers. ''It turned out that walking on the moon and protecting the crew inside the command module added up to a lot of sometimes not very compatible requirements,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit had to be comfortable enough to wear for hours in the confines of the command module, the capsule that took the astronauts to the moon and back, and not so bulky that the men could not work all the switches and levers on the spacecraft's console while strapped into their seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But walking on the moon required extra protection from heat and cold and micrometeoroids, and there was always the risk of falling and ripping something. So the Apollo suit had to be bulky, with about 20 layers, including an outer one of Beta cloth, which is woven from Teflon-wrapped glass fibers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compromises were made, Mr. Kerwin said. He described one incident involving the crew of the first manned Apollo flight in 1968, commanded by one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, Walter M. Schirra. As part of a test, the astronauts were strapped into the command module in fully pressurized suits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wally went nuts,'' Mr. Kerwin recalled. ''When they pressurized the suits, his right elbow overlapped the left elbow of the command module pilot, Donn Eisele, who was sitting in the center seat.'' Mr. Schirra complained loudly that he could not properly operate the spacecraft's controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And he was one of the original seven -- what Wally says goes,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mr. Schirra's insistence, the engineers restricted the shoulder joints in all the suits so that the arms would not overlap. ''But what he was doing was destroying in one blow all the careful mobility they'd put into those arms for the lunar surface job,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schirra's flight did not go to the Moon, so the extra mobility was not needed. For subsequent lunar flights, the engineers went back to the more mobile design, but for only two of each mission's three astronauts -- the two who would walk on the moon. ''The command module pilot never lands on the moon, so his suit can have the restricted shoulders,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a perfect example of when you have conflicting requirements, try not to destroy the most important one in order to fulfill a less important one,'' he continued. The engineers ''worked that kind of thing all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They got it right,'' he said. ''I have to say, they got it right.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement that NASA experimenters had found a bacterium that seems to be able to subsist on arsenic in place of phosphorus -- an element until now deemed essential for life -- set off a cascading storm of criticism on the Internet, first about alleged errors and sloppiness in the paper published in Science by Felisa Wolfe-Simon and her colleagues, and then about their and NASA's refusal to address the criticisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a stormy brew of debate about the role of peer review, bloggers and the reliability of NASA, at least as it pertains to microbiological issues, almost as toxic as the salty and arsenic waters of Mono Lake in California, from which Dr. Wolfe-Simon of the U.S. Geological Survey scooped up some bacteria last year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking evidence that life could follow a different biochemical path than what is normally assumed, Dr. Wolfe-Simon grew them in an arsenic-rich and phosphorus-free environment, reporting in the paper and a NASA news conference on Dec. 2 that the bacterium, strain GFAJ-1 of the Halomonadaceae family of Gammaproteobacteria, had substituted arsenic for phosphorus in many important molecules in its body, including DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ink had hardly dried on headlines around the world when microbiologists, who have been suspicious of NASA ever since the agency announced that it had found fossils of microbes in a meteorite from Mars in 1996, began shooting back, saying the experimenters had failed to provide any solid evidence that arsenic had actually been incorporated into the bacterium's DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a scathing commentary on her blog RRResearch, Rosie Redfield, a microbiologist at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, ran through a long list of what she said were errors and omissions in the paper, which she summarized in the end as ''lots of flim-flam, but very little reliable information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other mistakes, she and others say, the experimenters failed to wash the bug's DNA before testing it for arsenic, thus leaving the possibility that the arsenic detected there was just stuck to the outside of the giant molecule, like mud on the bottom of a shoe, a process she described as ''Microbiology 101.'' Over the course of a week her blog, which normally has a few hundred visitors a day, recorded almost 90,000 hits before the furor died down. She has also sent a letter to Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things got nastier when NASA and Dr. Wolfe-Simon refused to respond to such criticisms, which quickly leapt from Dr. Redfield and others' blogs to Wired and Slate and The Observatory, a blog covering the science press for the Columbia Journalism Review. According to CBC News, Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman, said that the agency wouldn't debate science with bloggers and would stick to peer-reviewed literature. The online tech magazine Gizmodo ran a highly doctored picture of Dr. Redfield and Dr. Wolfe-Simon staring lightning bolts at each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement on her own Web site, Dr. Wolfe-Simon noted that the paper had been carefully peer-reviewed and said, ''We've been concerned that some conclusions have been drawn based on claims not made in our paper,'' but did not elaborate on what those mistaken claims were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interest of stimulating healthy debate, she said, Science was making the paper available free of charge (although registration is required) for a couple of weeks. The experimenters are compiling a list of answers for frequently asked questions, which can be sent to gfajquestions@gmail.com and will eventually be posted online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Redfield said Mr. Brown's reaction was silly. ''We are the peers,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversation and arguing have always been an important part of how science has been done, she said. Once upon a time it was by mail, and was private and slow. ''Now,'' she said, ''the conversation is carried out in public in ways everyone can see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''This kind of intellectual analysis and give and take is a big chunk of the fun of doing science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, she said she sympathized with Dr. Wolfe-Simon's position as a woman in science advocating a controversial view, and she agreed with her decision to keep a low peer-reviewed profile. More arguing, as a blogger who goes by the name of Isis pointed out in a post titled ''Don't Like Arsenic Bacteria? Put Your Experiment Where Your Mouth Is!,'' will not solve the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only more data, which will probably be forthcoming, will tell whether the GFAJ-1 bug is weird life that has found a new way to live, or just tough and able to survive in arsenic. If the original paper was right, that would be ''great,'' said Dr. Redfield. But the opposite could also be presented as a demonstration that life is such a powerful force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA can spin it either way,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, a commercial spacecraft gently returned to Earth from orbit on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight, by the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, went flawlessly from the launching of its Falcon 9 rocket, with a Dragon capsule riding on top, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to splashdown of the Dragon in the Pacific Ocean 3 hours, 19 minutes and 52 seconds later.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was just 52 seconds later than <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a news conference afterward, Elon Musk, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s founder and chief executive, whose outsize confidence can verge on arrogance, was flustered as he talked about how everything worked as designed. ''It's actually almost too good,'' Mr. Musk said. ''We didn't have to go to backup systems at any point. I'm sort of in semishock.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was the first demonstration for NASA of a spacecraft designed to ferry cargo and perhaps eventually astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has a contract worth $1.6 billion for 12 flights to take cargo and supplies to the space station. With the imminent cancellation of NASA's Ares I rocket that was to take astronauts there, the space agency will be hiring private companies to provide astronaut transportation as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of the flight ''reinforces what the president laid out and what Congress endorsed as the future of space transportation,'' Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said in an interview. ''This does indeed validate the path we are on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk asserted that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> was in a strong position to win at least part of the astronaut-carrying business. The Dragon already has a pressurized cabin and has been designed from the beginning with the intention of carrying people. ''If there were people sitting in the Dragon capsule today, they would have had a very nice ride,'' Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine and a half minutes after Wednesday's launching, the Dragon capsule detached from the second stage of the Falcon 9. The capsule circled the Earth twice at an altitude of 186 miles before re-entering the atmosphere. Slowed by parachutes, it splashed down about 500 miles west of northern Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The achievement impressed Joseph Fragola, an expert on spacecraft reliability who has not been sure that commercial launchings of astronauts could immediately meet the same safety targets that NASA's system -- the Ares I and its accompanying Orion crew capsule -- were aiming for. ''In my gut, I expected some anomalies at least, but as of now there appear to have been none,'' Mr. Fragola said of Wednesday's flight. ''That was a surprise, given the challenging nature of the flight plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the flight, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> announced that the Falcon 9 also carried to orbit eight tiny satellites, including one for the United States Army to test new communications technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second demonstration flight, going close to the space station but not docking, is set for next spring. A third and final demonstration flight under <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s $278 million development contract would dock at the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the success of the first flight, Mr. Musk said <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hoped to combine the second and third flights into one. After the completion of the demonstrations, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would then begin the cargo flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the news conference, Mr. Musk regained some of his usual bravado, making a pitch that the Dragon could also be used for deep-space missions. In a revamped space program, work on the bigger and much more expensive Orion crew capsule will continue but is to ride on an as-yet-undesigned heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dragon has arguably more capability than Orion,'' Mr. Musk said. ''Basically, anything Orion can do, Dragon can do.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Without fanfare, without crowds of curious spectators, the future of the United States' space program sits on a launching pad here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket, a Falcon 9 built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short, is unassuming -- a runt compared to NASA's space shuttles. It is scheduled to lift off on Wednesday morning and place into orbit an empty capsule, designed to carry cargo and eventually astronauts, which will circle the Earth twice before splashing down in the Pacific. The mission is to last less than three and a half hours.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the flight lacks in theatrics, it marks a major shift in the space program toward private industry. It is the first demonstration flight under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration contract that is to lead to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s ferrying supplies to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, under a new space exploration blueprint signed into law in October, will now embark on a similar strategy for sending astronauts to orbit -- buying rides from commercial companies rather than operating its own rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few details have been revealed about the so-called commercial crew program, but the earlier cargo program, started in 2006, demonstrates some of the promise of greater bang for the buck. During a news conference on Monday, Philip McAlister, acting director of commercial spaceflight development at NASA, pointed to the $253 million NASA paid <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> so far for development of the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule and to the four years that it took to reach the first demonstration flight -- cheaper and quicker than previous rocket programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both of those things are remarkable,'' Mr. McAlister said at the news conference, ''and an anomaly in terms of any historical development that I'm aware of, in terms of a traditional NASA development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that the commercial crew program, with NASA likely to invest several billion dollars over the next six years, will enlist companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to drive down the cost of space travel and allow NASA to devote its limited budget to more ambitious missions to send astronauts farther out into the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo program also offers reason for caution because companies do not always meet their lofty predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program ran into an almost immediate speed bump when one of the two companies NASA chose, Rocketplane Kistler, could not raise the money it needed. NASA canceled Kistler's contract the following year and had to run a second competition, which was won by the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has been able to meet 17 of the 22 milestones in its contract, but took twice as long as it expected to do so. When it signed its contract in 2006, it predicted that it would get the first demonstration flight off in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the fixed-price contract, NASA did not pay extra, but <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had to seek additional financing from investors. Fixed-price contracts save taxpayers money if a company eventually completes its obligations, but waste time and money if the company fails like Kistler did. Orbital, which has received $155 million for meeting 15 of 21 milestones, is aiming for a demonstration flight late next year and beginning its cargo deliveries early in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has also already paid the two companies an additional $333 million under the cargo delivery contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have also begun hedging their bets, saying that one additional space shuttle flight is needed to carry up supplies before the shuttles are retired next year. The extra supplies would provide a buffer in case the schedules of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Orbital slip. ''That gives us a little bit of margin there to make sure that station isn't in dire circumstances before the commercial providers come fully online,'' said William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the extra flight, the space station would start running short of supplies in 2012. Congress has authorized the extra flight, but NASA's budget for 2011 has not yet been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even success in the cargo program does not assure success in carrying astronauts. Launching people into orbit is more complex and expensive, and a worry is that NASA's exacting standards to make spaceflight as safe as possible would place expensive and onerous conditions on the companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas R. Cooke, associate administrator of NASA's exploration systems mission directorate, which is running the commercial crew and cargo development programs, said that a draft of the human rating standards required of the commercial companies the same 1-in-1,000 chance of a fatal accident during launching that NASA's Ares I rocket and Orion capsule sought to meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more important, the path to making a profitable business out of sending a crew into space remains unclear. A commercial market has existed for decades for the launching of satellites; for example, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has already signed a $492 million contract with <span class="companylink">Iridium Communications Inc</span>. to launch Iridium's next-generation communication satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA's commercial crew needs might be as few as two flights a year, and no definite market beyond that yet exists for the flights, which will cost at least tens of millions of dollars per seat. John Elbon, vice president for commercial crew transportation at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which is also interested in bidding for the NASA business, said <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s analysis showed that the NASA business would probably be enough to be profitable. But it is the potential of the other markets, like space tourism or private space stations, that make it much more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Congress looking to rein in costs across the federal government, however, the commercial crew program might be squeezed even before it gets into full swing. President Obama had originally sought $6 billion over five years. Mr. Cooke said that NASA was looking at whether it could make do with half as much, $3 billion. ''We're looking at different options like that,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Why It Had It Coming</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mike Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">267 pages. Spiegel &amp; Grau. $25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caltech astronomy professor Mike Brown is not the first person to write about the rise of the planet Pluto (discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh) or its recent demotion (in 2006) to second-class citizenry in a newly reduced, eight-planet solar system. He may not even be the best, coming on the heels of Neil deGrasse Tyson's breezy ''Pluto Files,'' the novel ''Percival's Planet'' and at least one other nonfiction book on the cosmic Pluto flap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Brown has a unique distinction: He was, for a few hours in 2005, the only person on Planet Earth to know that the standard nine-planet solar system model was going to require rejiggering. He had just discovered a 10th potential planet, but he had also come to see that neither Pluto nor this new heavenly body (first nicknamed Xena, then officially named Eris) really measured up to the other eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't you think it would overall be better for astronomy to have new planets discovered than old planets killed?'' Dr. Brown is asked by his wife in ''How I Killed Pluto and Why it Had it Coming.'' His answer led to a lot of trouble. He replied that he though it would be best to get the facts right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is ample precedent for the kind of upheaval that Dr. Brown helped to create. He cites an 1837 textbook that described an 11-planet solar system and points out that by 1851 another 15 celestial bodies had been added to the list. So shake-ups and re-evaluations are hardly unprecedented in the world of astronomy. Still, Dr. Brown casts himself as something of a gunslinger, unusual billing in a tale of scientific research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's being facetious, as he often is in this short, eager-to-please research memoir. He has the kind of self-effacing, funny tone that must work well in a lecture hall. Thus he compares objects in the sky to fish in the ocean, with the asteroids as minnows, the major planets as whales and, within the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune where Pluto and other dwarf planets can be found, ''a previously overlooked collection of sardines swimming in a faraway sea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown's efforts to study this region could not have been conducted in earlier times. He relied on the huge telescopes and computer software that have so drastically altered the science of astronomy, advances that have caused scientists to face new technology-induced questions. Is it easiest to study a vast and highly magnified image of the sky? Or is there such a thing as photography so precise that it fills the heavens with (to use Dr. Brown's favorite type of metaphor) red herrings? How unwieldy is the huge amount of data that today's instruments can produce?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now that scientific information is stored in databases that can be accessed from anywhere in the world, what sort of ethics govern the use of that information? The most suspenseful part of ''How I Killed Pluto'' has to do with an unresolved dust-up between Dr. Brown and a Spanish group that jumped the gun to go public with the same information, a situation made even more ticklish by Dr. Brown's detection of hacking in his research database. ''Someone had come out of nowhere and kicked us in the gut,'' he writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conflicts over credit for astronomical discoveries have been around since the early 17th century, when Galileo used code and anagrams to protect his findings. But the speed with which discoveries can be made public has never been greater, and Dr. Brown found himself torn between the desire to be first and, as he saw it, the moral necessity of being right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually the pace would quicken when the whole Pluto question was taken up by the International Astronomical Association, an organization known for glacial pacing and rigorous rules. Dr. Brown and his team actually prepared four different news releases, anticipating the four possible outcomes of this group's deliberations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four options: Xena would be named a 10th planet; Pluto would get the boot, leaving only eight planets; nothing at all would change; or the word ''planet'' would suddenly be redefined. ''Why bother writing this one up?'' one of Dr. Brown's assistants asked about that fourth option. ''It sounds crazy. No one would decide this, would they?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would, and they did, creating a class of dwarf planets that included Pluto and also creating one very large Grinch: Dr. Brown himself. He grew up with the planet-memorizing mnemonic ''My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas.'' Now he's got a new one: ''Mean Very Evil Men Just Shortened Up Nature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the events in ''How I Killed Pluto'' were unfolding, Mr. Brown was also obsessed with a different kind of natural phenomenon. His slender, cheery book gets some padding in the form of his courtship, marriage, new fatherhood and (of course) blogging about his baby, Lilah. The presence of so many doting-father asides might get grating if Dr. Brown did not communicate his excitement and happiness so well and go about describing it in such wonky, scientific ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He used graph paper to chart the accuracy of babies' due dates. He kept meticulous data on baby feedings. And when he concluded without talking to his sister that she must be pregnant, she asked the kind of question that gives Dr. Brown's book its oddball edge. ''Are you studying astronomy or astrology?'' his sister wanted to know.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerned that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is dragging its feet in revamping its space program, a Senate panel sought assurances from Obama administration officials on Wednesday that NASA would carry out the orders it had been given for the next three years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those orders, which President Obama signed into law in October, include scrapping a program to send astronauts to the moon in favor of a heavy-lift rocket for deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hearing, by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, was the latest tussle over the future of sending astronauts into space. Unlike most disagreements in Washington, which divide Republicans and Democrats, the NASA debate has largely been a schism between the White House and Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been plenty of messages that have been sent to the overseers, which is this committee, that certain elements of NASA and other parts of the administration intend to follow their own directions instead of the law,'' said Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who led the hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the panel's ranking Republican, said, ''If there are any concerns about that implementation, or if there are impediments to it, we want to know right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser, assured the panel that NASA had every intention of doing what it was supposed to. When Mr. Nelson asked, ''Do you intend to follow the law in the NASA authorization bill?'' Dr. Holdren replied, ''Absolutely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Elizabeth Robinson, NASA's chief financial officer, assured Ms. Hutchison that NASA was planning to fly an extra space shuttle mission that the authorization law calls for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration, in its budget request for the 2011 fiscal year, had sought to cancel NASA's entire program to send astronauts back to the moon. A compromise led by Senators Nelson and Hutchison kills the moon program, known as Constellation, but lets NASA continue working on a crew capsule for traveling beyond Earth orbit and start working on a new heavy-lift rocket that could one day fly deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skepticism from the senators seems mainly to center on plans for the heavy-lift rocket. The authorization law specifies the rocket's capabilities: it is to be ready by the end of 2016, be able to carry 70 tons to low-Earth orbit and evolve into a system that can lift 130 tons. The law also says the rocket should take advantage of pieces from the space shuttles and the canceled Constellation rockets ''to the extent practicable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is to present to Congress a plan for the heavy-lift rocket in January, and the senators' concern was that the agency was looking to delay development or for some way to use alternative rockets like the Delta IV now used by the Air Force to launch satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA awarded contracts totaling $7.5 million to 13 companies to provide input on the heavy-lift design. The companies included <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, which builds the solid rocket motors that help lift the space shuttle into orbit and which the NASA law foresees as part of the heavy-lift. But <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, which launches the Delta IV, also received a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional members from Utah, where Alliant builds the solid rocket motors, have also expressed worries that NASA is looking for a way around the law. Two weeks ago, they met with Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, and Lori Garver, the deputy administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to have some assurance that NASA understood intent of the laws,'' said Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah. ''I don't think we were terribly satisfied.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bishop called the answers from General Bolden ''both vague and inconsistent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is limited in what it can do immediately. It has not been given a budget figure for the 2011 fiscal year, which started two months ago. And, although the authorization law signed in September requires the agency to cancel the Constellation program, there is a conflicting restriction that Congress put in last year's budget law that prevents NASA from canceling it.</p>

But the current cosmological hypothesis is that before the Big Bang there was nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Roger Penrose, the eminent British mathematician, is arguing that there is physical evidence that may predate the Big Bang. In a recent paper, he and his co-author, the physicist V. G. Gurzadyan, describe a pattern of concentric circles detected against the universal backdrop of cosmic microwave radiation generated by the Big Bang. These circles, they say, may be gravitational waves generated by collisions of superbig black holes before the Big Bang.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two scientists go even further, claiming that the evidence also suggests that our universe may ''be but one aeon in a (perhaps unending) succession of such aeons.'' What we think of as our ''universe'' may simply be one link in a chain of universes, each beginning with a big bang and ending in a way that sends detectable gravitational waves into the next universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument is highly controversial. But if the circles the two scientists have detected stand up to further examination -- if they're not the result of noise or instrumental error -- it could radically change the way we think about our universe. And the notion is no more radical than that of some cosmologists who argue that our universe is only one in a multiverse -- a possibly infinite number of co-existing, but undetectable, universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is: What do we do with these possibilities? Our answer is to marvel at them and be reminded, once again, that we live in a universe -- however we define it -- that contains more wonders than we can begin to imagine.</p>

The finding is important because the planet orbits a very old star that is nearing the end of its life span and may soon collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to study this and see how far the star can evolve until the whole planet is engulfed or destroyed,'' said Johny Setiawan, the study's lead author and an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. ''The most important thing is to understand how a planetary system evolves, and maybe our solar system will experience the same process in the next two or three billion years.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star, known as HIP 13044, has been around for at least six billion years and has only several million years of life left, Dr. Setiawan said. Currently, the star and its planet are in the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star has a low metallicity, which is a measure of elements other than hydrogen and helium. An abundance of metal is thought to help planets form, so it is surprising that the star has only about 1 percent of the metallicity of the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Metal helps form planetary embryos, and you need an embryo for the planet to pick up other materials and grow,'' Dr. Setiawan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear whether the planet ever had life forms, since it is a gaseous planet like Jupiter. Its distance from its host star is only a tenth of that between the Earth and the Sun, making life on any nearby planets that may exist virtually impossible because of high temperatures.</p>
