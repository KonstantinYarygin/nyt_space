<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's where Paul Largay, the president of Largay Travel, which specializes in adventure vacations, is selling seats on Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, scheduled to begin suborbital flights from the Mojave Desert to the fringe of space in late 2009.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Largay, 49, is one of 65 agents worldwide and the only one in the state authorized by London-based Virgin Galactic, a division of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Airways, to sell seats on the spacecraft. Mr. Largay was selected from an initial group of about 250 luxury travel agents after a long application process and a series of interviews with the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Largay, who lives in Woodbury, said he normally sells vacations like hot air balloon trips above the Alps and safaris to Africa for $20,000 to $300,000 to customers as far away as Europe, South America and the Cayman Islands. He said he underwent two days of training at Cape Canaveral in Florida before he began selling the space flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was mostly about how to address people's concerns and about the technology that is being used,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carolyn Wincer, the head of astronaut sales for Virgin Galactic, said Mr. Largay was chosen because of his experience, track record and client base.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we also really wanted were agents that were passionate about getting commercial space travel off the ground and making it a viable industry, and wanted to get in on the ground floor,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wincer said that since February, almost 200 people from 20 countries had agreed to pay $200,000 to be guaranteed a seat on one of the first flights on SpaceShipTwo, which will take six people at a time 70 miles above the Earth to the edge of space and back in roughly two hours.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that during the flight, passengers would be able to leave their seats and experience weightlessness, and their view will span 800 miles in any direction and include the curvature of the Earth and the blackness of space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be a real space flight,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Largay said he had four potential customers for the flight (a husband and wife and two men), none of whom wished to be identified. He said one was from Connecticut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides wealth, Mr. Largay said the four share one trait. ''They each just have a real sense of adventure,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Patterson, 55, a financier from Bronxville who bought his seat directly through Virgin Galactic, said that being one of the first civilians to fly into space was what attracted him.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be in the first 10,000 people is not nearly as exciting as being in the first 100 or so,'' he said. ''It's a tiny little community that is going to get to say they did this.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That exclusivity, Mr. Largay said, is what makes the trip so attractive to those with the desire and the money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've said to some of my clients that are interested: 'I can warranty you this: that you will never go to a cocktail party after you've taken this flight and have someone say ''checkmate'' to you.' ''   </p>

Sturckow, of the U.S. Marine Corps, goes by Rick or ''CJ,'' and was shuttle pilot on flights in 1998 and 2001. ''When I get back, all I can think about,'' he said, is '' when can I go do that again?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's training program is so extensive, he said, that he has told his crew that when they actually fly their mission, ''it's going to feel like we're in the simulator at the Johnson Space Center,'' he said. Using the abbreviation for simulation, he added, ''It's going to feel like we're going from one sim to the next for 12 days.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Lee Joseph Archambault of the Air Force will serve as pilot on his first mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His inspiration for becoming an astronaut, he said, was Eugene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon and a native of a town close to his hometown of Bellwood, Ill. ''He was definitely the hometown hero of the people in the community that I grew up in,'' he recalled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Archambault, who is 46, joined the astronaut Corps in 1998, along with crew mates Steve Swanson and Danny Olivas, and they have all been waiting since then for a flight. But, he said, he's not complaining. ''You get here, you're happy to be here, you wait in line, you keep doing a good job -- and eventually good things will come,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A a pilot who loves high-performing aircraft in the Air Force, he said the moment he was waiting for is ''when the solid rocket boosters light and you have seven million pounds of thrust pushing you away from earth into space.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His nickname, going back to his Air Force days, is ''Bru.'' The name is an abbreviation for ''bomb rack unit,'' a part of an F-111 that he and his crew partner accidentally jettisoned ''through an unfortunate series of switch-throws.'' The unit landed harmlessly in a bombing range, but the nickname stuck. '' As my commander made it very clear to me, to have lost a $7,806 piece of equipment'' was not a good thing, he said with a laugh. ''In hindsight, it turned out to be nothing but a little bit of an embarrassing experience for me,'' he said, and '' it was a good lesson'' he carries to this day. ''In the space shuttle, there's plenty of opportunity to back up your crewmates in everything they're doing.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James F. Reilly II is 53 years old and grew up in Mesquite, Tex. He has a Ph.D. in geosciences, and is coming back to the station six years after his first visit. This is his third mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, he said people have often asked him to describe the best thing about flying in space after having flown the first time. After long thought, he said he has an answer: ''It's not so much what you see and what you feel and what you do, it's who you fly with. You know, you get up there and you're with these people and you're doing this incredible work and going through what is a phenomenal experience, and you just get to know these people really well.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that the number of opportunities to fly will dwindle was the program nears its end. ''At some point you realize that this one might be your last flight, which this one may be my last, just doing the math of the people that are in the pipeline and when we stop flying the shuttle,'' he said. ''This one may very well be my last flight.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Patrick G. Forrester is retired from the Army and is 50. He was born in El Paso, Tex., and he and his wife have two children. He is a seasoned spacewalker, and is training his fellow spacewalkers to be ready on this mission for the fact that the training they get in the enormous swimming pool at the Johnson Space Center does not fully recreate the state of weightlessness, and that it's important to get acclimated to the quirks of weightless living.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in space, although things weigh nothing, they still have mass, he explained in an interview -- and mass, he said, can be tricky. ''Although gravity doesn't have an impact on it as far as wanting to pull it down toward the Earth, that it still has mass related to its velocity. So that once you get something moving, that it takes almost as much effort to get it to stop moving.'' He flew with Commander Sturckow in 2001, and ''I was the only one on the crew that had not flown in space before.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Sturckow, he said, ''grabbed me and pulled me aside and he said, 'I want you to know that even though you've never flown, that I will never treat you like a rookie.' '' That supportive attitude, he said ''really endeared me to him.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA makes demands on the lives of its astronauts, he said. ''Even if you're not training for a mission, there are a lot of demands and requirements on the astronauts' schedule.'' He addd, however, that ''it is all worth it -- and it is no different than what I experienced in the military. And my family is very much behind this,'' he added.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John D. Olivas, who goes by Danny, grew up in El Paso, Tex. He and his wife have five children. In an interview, he said that many of the skills for the mission have come from before his time at NASA, ''when I worked for  <span class="companylink">Dow Chemical</span> in Freeport, Texas'' and did maintenance on the production plants.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Doing that kind of work taught me a lot about, I think, what I see, parallels in the kind of spacewalks and the things that we're supposed to do in spacewalks,'' he said. ''I use everything, all the tools that I've accumulated through my life,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and materials science from Rice University, and has six patents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency, like any organization that works with high risks, can get complacent if things get too comfortable, he said. ''And then the things that you never thought would bite you end up biting you.'' He added, however, that ''we are very sensitive to that fact here at NASA,'' and besides, ''if you're worried about everything all the time, you would never go out.''   </p>

His crew nickname is ''Swanny.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his children -- the oldest is in his 20s, and the youngest is 11 -- are all well aware that flying in space can be hazardous. ''You just tell them the truth,'' he said. ''You tell them in life, there are some things you do that have risks, and it's something you live with.''   </p>

He earned master of science degree in Aerospace Engineering from Iowa State University in 1983. He was only added to the shuttle crew recently, when NASA officials decided to bring Commander Williams back on this delayed flight instead of the later flight that had been originally planned. He said in an interview on the NASA Web site that he was inspired by the space program when his parents woke him and his brother and sister up in the middle of the night to watch television coverage of the first astronauts to go around the moon on the Apollo 8 mission. He said his mother believes that his path toward becoming an astronaut was set early on.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 8 -- The shuttle Atlantis thundered off the launching pad into a stunningly clear evening sky on Friday on a mission to continue building the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle blasted off at 7:38 p.m. Eastern time with the rattling roar of more than seven million pounds of thrust and rose on a snaking column of smoke and a flame nearly as bright as the dipping sun. Atlantis had what appeared to be a flawless ascent, though the videos that will show whether insulating foam or other launching debris hit the craft have yet to be examined thoroughly.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a mission already delayed three months by a hailstorm that damaged the foam on the shuttle's external tank, the preparations for launching were smooth. Weather concerns and technical glitches that often cause last-minute delays were nowhere to be found, and the launching unfolded with clockwork efficiency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before the liftoff, however, it appeared that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration might cancel because of poor weather over the emergency landing sites in Spain and France. These sites, known as Transatlantic Abort Landing sites or TAL, are needed if problems with the engines during an ascent require the shuttle to return to earth without reaching orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 minutes before launching time, the fog that obscured the Istres strip in France cleared enough to allow the launching to go forward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before the liftoff, Michael Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, told the commander, Col. Frederick W. Sturckow, using his nickname, ''O.K., C. J., it took us a little while to get to this point, but the ship's in great shape, so good luck and godspeed. We'll see you back here in about 12 days or so.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Sturckow radioed back with thanks to those who had made the launching possible and added, ''See you in a couple of weeks.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis is carrying a 17.5-ton truss to the station on this 11-day mission. The truss will be added to the starboard side of the $100 billion orbiting laboratory, and will provide power through its new solar arrays.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission requires the astronauts to work through tasks that have, for the most part, been done on previous missions on the station's port side. They will attach the new truss to the structure of the station and remove restraining bolts that hold a rotating joint in place. Once freed, the joint will allow the solar arrays to rotate and track the sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new solar arrays will be unfurled, and an old solar array on top of the station that provided power early in the life of the station will be refolded to its compact shape, otherwise the old array would interfere with the movement of the new arrays. The folded-up array will be moved later to the main solar array truss and extended again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew, led by Colonel Sturckow of the Marine Corps, includes the pilot, Col. Lee Joseph Archambault of the Air Force; James F. Reilly II; Patrick G. Forrester; Steven R. Swanson; John D. Olivas, and Clayton C. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was added to the team in April and will be traveling on Atlantis to take the place of Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who is ending a six-month stay aboard the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hailstorm, which occurred on Feb. 26, pocked the shuttle's external fuel tank with thousands of dents to its delicate foam. NASA rolled the craft back to its hangar, the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building, to have the smaller dents smoothed and the large ones sanded out and refilled with new foam. NASA scrambled to deal with more damage to a single tank than the agency had ever faced, but officials noted that almost all of the repair methods had been a part of working with tanks since the beginning of the program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview on Friday, Michael D. Griffin, NASA's administrator, said that the tank, which was left with a decidedly speckled appearance after the storm and repairs, ''looks great.'' Mr. Griffin said he had no worries that the mended tank would shed foam, the cause of the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour after the launching, the smoke from the solid rocket boosters hung in wild loops above the cape, luminous in the dusky sky.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in a briefing for reporters, NASA officials exulted. The external tank ''has performed in a magnificent manner,'' said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some debris was spotted about the time the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned, Mr. Hale said that this had occurred after the point when foam debris is a threat to the craft. He joked that he turned to John Chapman, the external tank project manager, and said, ''Give me more speckled tanks.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 7 -- Three months after its external fuel tank took thousands of dings and pockmarks from the golf-ball-size hailstones of a freakish winter storm, the space shuttle Atlantis is ready to fly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA plans to launch the first shuttle mission of 2007 from the Kennedy Space Center at 7:38 p.m. Friday. The weather is expected to be very good, with just a 20 percent chance of a delay.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pockmarks have been repaired. But at a briefing last month, NASA cautioned reporters not to trust their eyes when they saw the mottled tank. Repaired spots have a creamy color, and the tank will have a speckled appearance until the spots darken over time to the tank's characteristic orange.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your mind will have a hard time convincing your eyes'' that the finished product is smooth and robust enough to take the punishment of launching, said John Chapman, the external tank manager for the space shuttle program. He added, ''It's going to look pretty speckly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been looking a little battered lately as well. The agency has been reeling in recent months from missteps and sheer bad luck, including a fatal shooting by a disgruntled employee at the Johnson Space Center in Houston; the arrest and dismissal of a shuttle astronaut, Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, who faces charges of attempted kidnapping over a confrontation with a romantic rival; and a furor over comments by the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, that he was not sure climate change ''is a problem we must wrestle with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the shuttle is on the launching pad again, with three more flights on the schedule by the end of the year. The delays have forced the space agency to cram its already tight schedule of flights before the shuttle program ends in 2010; NASA had originally scheduled five flights for this year. The program's remaining flights are devoted to completing the international space station, except for a single flight to service the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA announced Thursday that the date of that mission has been tentatively set for Sept. 10, 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew is led by Col. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marine Corps, a veteran of two previous flights who is serving on this flight as commander. The pilot is Col. Lee Joseph Archambaultof the Air Force. Other members of the crew are James F. Reilly II, Patrick G. Forrester, Steven R. Swanson, John D. Olivas and Clayton C. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was only recently added to the mission and will be traveling on Atlantis to swap places with Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who has been working aboard the space station for six months and whose return has been held up by the numerous shuttle delays. The crew will strap into their seats about 4:15 p.m.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 11-day mission, Atlantis will lug a 17.5-ton truss to the space station and astronauts will put it in place. The solar panels on the truss will be unfurled; a rotating joint that will allow the new arrays to track the sun will be readied and started; and an older set of panels that would block the motion of the new ones will be retracted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the mission's tasks have been done before, and NASA hopes that in three scheduled spacewalks the astronauts will overcome previous crews' problems, like balky bolts and unwieldy solar panels that did not fold back up smoothly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the launching, all eyes will be on that fuel tank. The smallest dents that required repair were sanded smooth. Deeper ones were repaired by carving out the holes and filling them with new foam, and the broad areas with the most hits were sanded down by a half inch or more with the foam reapplied.  <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> engineers created an ingenious new tool for milling the foam toward the pointy tip of the tank; they called it the ''pencil sharpener.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all the repairs are common to tank preparation, but there have never been so many on a single tank. NASA officials said the repairs had been thoroughly tested and were safe, though Mr. Chapman acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that ''you don't know until you fly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if some of the foam rattles off the tank during ascent, NASA officials insist, the pieces will be too small to damage the craft -- much smaller than the 1.67-pound chunk of foam that broke a hole in the wing of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and doomed that craft and its crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said NASA now deals with safety issues far more thoroughly than it did before the Columbia disaster. Dr. Logsdon, who served on the independent board that investigated the loss of Columbia and its crew, said that now, ''The flight-readiness review process is as thorough as it's ever going to be with Mike Griffin in charge.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon added: ''They made an engineering judgment, and that's what we pay them to do. There's some level of risk in everything associated with this vehicle. All you can do is the very best job you can do, and then make a judgment.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 7 -- Hitching a ride on the space shuttle comes to the lucky few only after a long selection process and arduous training. But the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex has worked with current and former astronauts to develop a ride that just may be the next best thing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $60 million Shuttle Launch Experience opened Memorial Day weekend. The 44,000-square-foot building holds four simulators, each of which can accommodate 44 people, taking them through a special effects-heavy approximation of the stages of launching and ascent.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production opens with visitors standing for a ''pre-launch briefing'' on video by Brig. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., now retired, who was twice a shuttle commander in his four flights. General Bolden's lively description of the basics is punctuated by powerful bass speakers providing a sensory jolt. Then visitors strap into their seats in the simulator, which looks like an overgrown can that has been loaded into the payload bay of a shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At ''liftoff'' there are more sounds and shaking seats. The entire simulator rears back on hydraulic lifts, setting the passengers up at a nearly 70-degree angle. As the sound and shaking intensifies, air bladders concealed in the seat cushions soften to give the feeling of being pressed back into the seats by the three-G force of ascent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a slight power decrease during ''Max Q,'' the period of maximum stress on the vehicle during ascent, when the shuttle briefly eases off its power and then ramps it up again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a noise and jolt as the solid rocket boosters are blown away from the shuttle, and another when the external tank is released -- and the simulator rocks back toward the floor and points slightly downward to emulate the thrown-into-the-straps feeling that astronauts describe as they first encounter the reduced acceleration and gravity of orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a real flight, that part of the ascent would have taken eight and a half minutes, but for the passengers on the ride, barely five minutes pass. At that point, the payload bay opens, celestial music plays, and the passengers see a projected image of Earth sliding by below.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Richard A. Searfoss, a former shuttle commander, used what he called an ''astronaut-calibrated rear end'' to help the companies that designed and developed the ride. ''I am just amazed how good they've gotten it,'' Colonel Searfoss said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Matthew Eyers, a 12-year-old visiting Florida with his family from Hampshire, England, said he enjoyed the ride -- even if, by some standards, the shuttle is yesterday's news. A few days before, he had ridden the retro-futuristic Space Mountain ride at Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom at  <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is realistic,'' Matthew said with satisfaction. His father, Tim Eyers, put it differently: ''This is more down to earth.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, no one can hear you giggle. Except maybe Douglas Florian.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poet-painter's latest book brings warm wit to the outermost reaches of cold, dark space. Twenty short poems paired with paintings on double-page spreads create an interstellar journey, starting with ''Skywatch,'' an invitation to the pleasures of amateur astronomy. The book travels through our solar system and ends up in the somewhat vaguer territory of comets, black holes and ''the Great Beyond.'' At the end, there's a ''galactic glossary'' and a short bibliography with suggestions for further reading. (Tots demanding ''A Brief History of Time''? Blame this book!)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florian's illustrations depict the marvels of space with luminous texture and detail. Painted in gouache on brown paper bags, they're littered with a secondary text of rubber-stamped words and collaged with scraps of star maps, photographs and other surprises. Die-cut, circular peepholes give glimpses of stars and planets from neighboring pages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most engaging verses in ''Comets, Stars'' serve up planetary facts with a dose of cheeky humor. Take, for example, ''Venus'': ''Scalding-hot surface, / Nine hundred degrees. / Nothing can live there, / No creatures, / No trees. / Poisonous clouds / Of acid above. / Why was it named for / the goddess of love?'' Or ''Pluto,'' a riff on cosmic injustice: ''Pluto was a planet. / But now it doesn't pass. / Pluto was a planet. / They say it's lacking mass. / Pluto was a planet. / Pluto was admired. / Pluto was a planet. / Till one day it got fired.'' Poor Pluto!   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted that these are standout stanzas. Some of Florian's poems stumble on lumpy rhymes or fall flat (see ''The Comet,'' which begins: ''Ice, rock, dirt / Metal and gas -- / Around the sun / A comet may pass.'') Previous books better showcase his lively writing with subjects that are -- quite literally -- alive. His ''Insectlopedia'' and ''Mammalabilia'' offer hilarious observations of animals, while collections like ''Winter Eyes'' find poignancy in the shared seasonal rituals of human beings. Until we find life on Mars, Florian's most enjoyable work will probably stay rooted here, on plain old planet Earth.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astrophysicist Neil F. Comins sounds confident that the age of space tourism is on the horizon. ''Voyages to Mars, asteroids, comets, and the Jovian system -- Jupiter and the bodies orbiting it -- will all be feasible destinations in the coming half-century,'' he writes. A round trip to any planet this side of Saturn will, ''under ideal conditions,'' take no more than five years of your life. For this starry-eyed prediction to come true, however, he wants us to banish any science-fiction illusions that these trips will be pleasure cruises. His original and sobering book -- part fictional spaceship log, part nuts-and-bolts survival manual -- warns of mundane dangers out there to mind and body far more serious than power-mad Klingons or homicidal computers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, any prolonged flight outside the atmosphere risks exposure of cells to sickening levels of radiation. The skin of a spaceship is not much safer. Space is littered with lithic debris, and a collision with a particle no bigger than a pebble could well be catastrophic. (Pockmarks from thousands of tiny impacts slowed the orbit of the Salyut 7 space station so much that it fell from the sky.) A state of microgravity for years will also take its toll on physical and psychic health. Between 3 and 13 percent of personnel on any space mission are likely to show signs of mental illness from claustrophobia, homesickness, chronic boredom and inactivity. The bacteria that causes tooth decay may grow faster in outer space, where dentists are scarce. Food will taste worse and be harder to digest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landing after years of confinement in a titanium can won't offer much relief either. Landslides and earthquakes will make a simple hike on some surfaces riskier than a trip to the Baghdad airport. ''Walking around on Io will be like exploring a minefield,'' Mr. Comins writes, referring to one of Jupiter's 63 known moons. ''Each step will bring you into contact with life-threatening geological conditions.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His fictional space voyager, Mack Richardson, is less grave (and funnier) about the problems that space tourists will face. He tells us that engineers have still not succeeded in eliminating ''new spaceship smell.'' And given the 10 years he has been away, he has seen his ''two wonderful children'' no more than three times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without ever coming out and saying so, this guide has a timely environmental message for passengers eager to book a suborbital trip on Virgin Galactic's spaceship, scheduled to begin operating in 2010, or any of the joy rides for billionaires. Before rushing off to visit and ''terraform'' other planets, we would be wise to take care of this one. RICHARD B. WOODWARD   </p>

Then comes something to remind us. This time it is a colossal supernova, called SN 2006gy, the brightest ever recorded. A supernova is an exploding star. This one, first observed last September, lies about 240 million light-years from us in the constellation Perseus. The explosion was perhaps 100 times more powerful than an ordinary supernova, and the star that exploded may have been 150 times the Sun's mass, ''freakishly massive,'' as one astronomer put it. A photograph of SN 2006gy shows that it vastly outshines the entire galaxy in which it is located. This takes some imagining.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so does the nature of the explosion itself, which puzzled observers at first. The usual explanations could not account for a supernova on this scale, nor was this the predictable demise of such a massive star. Instead, this anomalous explosion seems to offer a glimpse into one of the essential conditions for the universe we observe -- the dispersal of heavy elements like carbon and iron. What we are witnessing in SN 2006gy may be the making of the very atomic stuff out of which we ourselves are made. We are used to the notion that looking at the stars means looking back in time. Looking at SN 2006gy may mean looking at one of the fundamental processes in a much earlier universe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers point to an analogous star in our own galaxy, Eta Carinae, about 7,500 light-years away. It is similar in size, and similar in instability, to the star that turned, dying, into SN 2006gy. There is a possibility that Eta Carinae may itself die a similar, extraordinary death. It is perhaps unwise to hope for grand celestial events in one's lifetime. Stunning discoveries from the past should be enough. But it is tempting to wonder what such a nearby supernova, on such a scale, would be like, how it would be to live under such an altered sky.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could revisit the 1960s cosmonaut fantasy designs of Pierre Cardin and Andre Courreges -- as did so many contemporary designers in their futuristic spring 2007 collections. But Philippe Starck, the French designer who is consulting as art director for Richard Branson's development of Virgin Galactic spacecraft, said that one of his original proposals was for future space explorers to travel naked.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a cascade of superlatives that belies the traditional cerebral reserve of their profession, astronomers reported yesterday that they had seen the brightest and most powerful stellar explosion ever recorded.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cataclysm -- a monster more than a hundred times as energetic as the typical supernova in which the more massive stars end their lives -- may be an example, they said, of a completely new type of explosion. Such a blast, proposed but never seen, would explain how the earliest and most massive stars in the universe ended their lives and strewed new elements across space to fertilize future stars and planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is quite possibly the most massive star that has ever been seen to explode,'' said Nathan Smith of the University of California, Berkeley, who estimated it as ''freakishly massive,'' about 150 times the mass of the Sun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Smith led a team of astronomers from Berkeley and the University of Texas who have submitted a paper about the supernova to The Astrophysical Journal and discussed the results yesterday at a news conference from NASA headquarters in Washington. ''We're really excited about this,'' he said. ''If it really is what we think it is, it forces us to rethink how massive stars die.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have been following the star since last September, when it was discovered in a galaxy 240 million light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The discovery was made by Robert Quimby, a University of Texas graduate student, who was using a small robotic telescope at McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Tex., to troll for supernovas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star bears an eerie resemblance to Eta Carinae, a star in our own galaxy that has been burbling and bubbling in the last few centuries as if getting ready for its own outburst. The observations suggest that the troubled and enigmatic Eta Carinae, thought to weigh in at about 120 solar masses, could blow up sooner than theorists have thought. Mario Livio, a theorist at the Space Telescope Science Institute who was not involved in the research, said Eta Carinae's death could be ''the most spectacular star show in history.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cautioning that theorists still did not know for sure what had caused the explosion announced yesterday, Dr. Livio said: ''Here we have the brightest supernova we have ever observed, and we don't know the explosion mechanism. It doesn't get any more exciting for a theorist.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such supermassive stars are extremely rare in the modern universe but are believed to have been common among the first stars that formed when the universe was less than a billion years old. The blast raises astronomers' hopes that the next generation of bigger telescopes, like NASA's coming James Webb Space Telescope, will be able to detect these stars by their explosions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ironically, we might first detect the first generation of stars by their deaths,'' said Alex Filippenko, another team member from Berkeley.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supernovas come about in two basic ways: explosions of small stars about one and half times the mass of the Sun, which are known as white dwarfs and are uniform enough to serve as cosmological distance markers; and the collapse of the cores of more massive stars into black holes or neutron stars when their thermonuclear fuel has run out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers first suspected that the supernova's dramatic output was caused by the shock wave of a white dwarf exploding into a dense cloud of hydrogen. When observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory failed to find enough X-rays to support that idea, the group was forced to consider an alternative: that the luminosity was produced by the decay of radioactive nickel. But to match the observations, the star would have had to produce 22 solar masses of radioactive nickel -- way off scale for the core collapse model.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In desperation, the astronomers turned to a theory proposed nearly 40 years ago by Zalman Barkat of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his colleagues. The intensity of radiation in the cores of supermassive stars could be so great, they said, that pairs of electrons and their antimatter opposites, positrons, would be created.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is bad news for the star,'' Dr. Livio said, explaining that the disappearance of the radiation would sap the core's energy and cause the star to collapse. But in this case the star still has plenty of fuel and blows up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The core is still composed of explosive oxygen,'' explained another of the paper's authors, J. Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas. ''The oxygen ignites and blows the star to smithereens with no remnant, no black hole left.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''pair instability,'' as it is known, is particularly convenient for the very first stars, made of pristine hydrogen and helium fresh from the furnace of the Big Bang. The resulting explosion scatters all the star's ashes -- the newly made elements like iron and carbon important for life -- outward into space where they can be made into new stars instead of down a black hole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It effectively fertilizes the material from which the second and third generation was made,'' Dr. Filippenko said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary reason for the Jupiter flyby in February was a gravitational slingshot that accelerated the New Horizons by 9,000 miles an hour to its current speed of 52,000 miles an hour.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the New Horizons was in the neighborhood anyway, its cameras zoomed in on sights like the Little Red Spot, a smaller version of the famous Great Red Spot, Jupiter's thin rings and the volcanic eruptions on Io, a Jovian moon. The encounter also gave the New Horizons team a chance to practice and prepare for a Pluto visit in July 2015.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've really learned how to drive this spacecraft,'' said S. Alan Stern, associate administrator of NASA for the science mission directorate and the principal investigator for the New Horizons mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference last week, scientists working on the mission presented a sampling from 700 observations taken on the flyby.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spacecraft approached, it had a good view of boulders in Jupiter's narrow rings and of the way two tiny moons, Metis and Adrastea, nudged and shepherded them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the best-ever views we've ever received of Jupiter's rings,'' said Jeff Moore of the Ames Research Center in California, who led the science effort during the flyby. ''By incredible good luck, we happened to be on the right trajectory with the right instruments.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the flyby, the New Horizons took rearview photographs of sunlit dust particles in the rings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Little Red Spot formed over the last 10 years, when three smaller storms in Jupiter's atmosphere merged, and is now about half the diameter of the Great Red Spot that has swirled for 300 years. Over the last year, the smaller spot has become redder, presumably as it sucks up colored materials lower in the atmosphere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one image, the scientists combined a color photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope with a more detailed black-and-white image from the New Horizons. Hal Weaver of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, a project scientist for the mission, said it evoked van Gogh's ''Starry Night.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But this is the real deal,'' Dr. Weaver said. Other instruments on the spacecraft might be able to identify different materials in the different clouds, giving scientists clues on atmospheric dynamics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons flyby coincided with large eruptions on Io, the most geologically active body in the solar system. By luck, the craft was able to capture a plume from the volcano Tvashtar rising 200 miles into space. As it flies away, the spacecraft continues to gather data on charged particles that flow down the tail of magnetic fields on Jupiter.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers announced last week that they had found what might be the first habitable planet outside the solar system. Known poetically as Gliese 581c, the new planet is only five times as massive as the Earth and inhabits a sweet zone around a dim red star in Libra where it is neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water. The star and its retinue of planets are only 20 light years away. ''We could go there,'' enthused Dimitar Sasselov, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, noting that 20 light years is next door in a galaxy 100,000 light years across. But he was speaking for the very, very long term. However near cosmically, the Gliese planet is still about 120 trillion miles away. Voyager 1, now leaving the solar system at a speed of about 39,000 miles per hour, would need more than 300,000 years to travel that far.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists and engineers point out, however, that it is possible to attain much higher speeds with spacecraft that undergo a gentler but steady acceleration throughout the trip, rather than getting a short violent boost at the beginning like Voyager and current rockets do. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University, and author of ''The Physics of Star Trek,'' said that a ship that could maintain an acceleration equivalent to the gravity felt on Earth would attain a velocity of half the speed of light in three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology for that much oomph is nowhere in sight, but NASA has experimented with gentler versions like solar sails, in which the spacecraft is propelled by sunlight, or ion drives, pioneered on a spacecraft named Deep Space 1, which visited a comet in 2001, in which high-energy particles do the propelling. This year a new spacecraft, Dawn, will use ion propulsion to begin a cruise around the asteroid belt. But even ion drives have to carry prohibitive amounts of fuel to reach the stars, said Marc Rayman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Dawn's project system engineer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take Dawn 10,000 days and 5,000 pounds of propellant to get up to 150,000 miles per hour, which is only .02 percent of the speed of light, ''which is nothing,'' said Dr. Rayman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's an illustration of how daunting this travel is,'' he said. ''The distances are vast, the challenges are extraordinary.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have any doubt that humankind will eventually have the technology to send spacecraft that distance,'' he said, adding, ''I have no idea how it will be done.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sasselov said that in the long run, in order to survive planetary catastrophes, we would want to make the trip, by whatever means.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have to go next year or even in the next 20 years,'' Dr. Sasselov said. But eventually, he said, ''if we figure out our human affairs down on here on Earth, we'll want to be moving along.'' DENNIS OVERBYE   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers have discovered a planet five times as massive as the Earth orbiting a dim red star known as Gliese 581.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the smallest of the 200 or so planets that are known to exist outside of our solar system, the extrasolar or exo-planets. It orbits its home star within the so-called habitable zone where surface water, the staff of life, could exist if other conditions are right, said Stephane Udry of the Geneva Observatory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are at the right place for that,'' said Dr. Udry, the lead author of a paper describing the discovery that has been submitted to the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he and other astronomers cautioned that it was far too soon to conclude that liquid water was there without more observations. Sara Seager, a planet expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ''For example, if the planet had an atmosphere more massive than Venus's, then the surface would likely be too hot for liquid water.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the discovery in the Gliese 581 system, where a Neptune-size planet was discovered two years ago and another planet of eight Earth masses is now suspected, catapults that system to the top of the list for future generations of space missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the treasure map of the universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X,'' said Xavier Delfosse, a member of the team from Grenoble University in France, according to a news release from the European Southern Observatory, a multinational collaboration based in Garching, Germany.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who studies the structure and formation of planets, said: ''It's 20 light-years. We can go there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet was discovered by the wobble it causes in its home star's motion as it orbits, using the method by which most of the known exo-planets have been discovered. Dr. Udry's team used an advanced spectrograph on a 141-inch-diameter telescope at the European observatory in La Silla, Chile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, Gliese 581c, circles the star every 13 days at a distance of about seven million miles. According to models of planet formation developed by Dr. Sasselov and his colleagues, such a planet should be about half again as large as the Earth and composed of rock and water, what the astronomers now call a ''super Earth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most exciting part of the find, Dr. Sasselov said, is that it ''basically tells you these kinds of planets are very common.'' Because they could stay geologically active for billions of years, he said he suspected that such planets could be even more congenial for life than Earth. Although the new planet is much closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, the red dwarf Gliese 581 is only about a hundredth as luminous as the Sun. So seven million miles is a comfortable huddling distance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How hot the planet gets, Dr. Udry said, depends on how much light the planet reflects, its albedo. Using the Earth and Venus as two extreme examples, he estimated that temperatures on the surface of the planet should be in the range of 0 degrees to 40 degrees centigrade.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just right in the good range,'' Dr. Udry said. ''Of course, we don't know anything about its albedo.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem is that the wobble technique only gives masses of planets. To measure their actual size and thus find their densities, astronomers have to catch the planets in the act of passing in front of or behind their stars. Such transits can also reveal if the planets have atmospheres and what they are made of.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Udry said he and Dr. Sasselov would be observing the Gliese system with a Canadian space telescope named MOST to see if there are any dips in starlight caused by the new planet. Failing that, they said, the best chance for more information about the system lies with the Terrestrial Planet Finder, a NASA mission, and the Darwin missions of the European Space Agency, which are designed to study Earthlike planets, but have been delayed by political, technical and financial difficulties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are starting to count the first targets,'' Dr. Udry said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, an errant computer command five months earlier had been placed in the wrong location of the computer memory for the spacecraft. That, in effect, implanted a fatal defect in the spacecraft, disabling a safety feature to prevent the solar panels from rotating too far and mangling its ability to communicate with Earth in case of a mishap.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Nov. 2 , a run-of-the-mill command to the Global Surveyor set off the latent time bomb. Because the safety feature had been disabled, the solar panels rotated as far as they could, causing the spacecraft to ''think'' erroneously that the panels had jammed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its last 13-minute contact, the Global Surveyor reported numerous alarms to mission controllers but gave no indication that it was in immediate danger.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spacecraft tried to recover, it ended up in an orientation such that the Sun was shining directly on a battery, causing it to overheat. The Global Surveyor misinterpreted that signal, sensing that it had overcharged the battery and stopped charging its other battery, as well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, because the June error caused the craft's antenna to point in the wrong direction, mission controllers on Earth could not get in touch with the craft again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a sort of unfortunate concatenation of events,'' said Dolly Perkins, deputy director-technical of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who was chairwoman of the review board.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within half a day, the Global Surveyor batteries drained dead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chain of events leading to the craft's doom started in September 2005 on a routine technical update. For redundancy, the information was copied to two separate locations in the computer memory, but at different times with slightly different values. That led to a slight inconsistency, and when the engineers tried to repair that in June, they caused the bigger problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review board said that the mission team had properly followed its procedures, but that the procedures were inadequate and that more thorough checks of its commands could have found the errors before they were sent to the spacecraft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Global Surveyor was launched in 1996 and arrived at Mars 10 months later. After gradually moving into a circular orbit, its science mission started in March 1999 and was to last one Martian year, or 687 Earth days, until January 2001. But the spacecraft continued operating long after that, sending back more than 240,000 photographs.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone with an interest in astronomy and an Internet connection can find the raw images at sites like   www.nasa.gov  [http://www.nasa.gov], and NASA occasionally releases photographs of breathtaking beauty. But the artist's eye can transform what started as scientific data, and even the best of NASA's pictures on a newspaper page or a screen do not give a hint of the richness of these prints.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in 1995 Mr. Benson spent years sifting through hundreds of thousands of photographs, looking for those that offered an aesthetic punch. He then painstakingly combined images, using digital tools like Photoshop, to eliminate dropouts and blurs from individual photos beamed back across millions of miles of space. A lovely picture of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, gliding in front of the swirling atmosphere of that planet, for example, is a blend of some 70 frames sent back by Voyager.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images come from as far back as 1970s explorations by space-faring robots like Mariner 10, the Viking Orbiters and Voyager. More recent ones come from Cassini, which is sending data back from the outer planets, and the plucky rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are still motoring around the surface of Mars. Many are drawn from the multiyear project that culminated in Mr. Benson's 2003 book, ''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes'' (Harry N. Abrams); they provide views of hothouse Venus, desertlike Mars and two decidedly otherworldly moons of Jupiter: Io and Europa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These photographs have the power to startle, especially those that capture the freaky beauty of erupting volcanoes on Io and the intensely detailed patterns of fractures of Europa's icy surface. The Valles Marineris canyon system, spanning 2,500 miles of desert on Mars, has a kind of dust-bowl beauty, and the surface of Venus, as peeked at by radar through its covering of sulfuric acid-laden clouds, seems sadly spectral.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it art if a robot snaps the shutter? In a response to questions by e-mail, Mr. Benson, an American who lives in Slovenia, said, ''Although I didn't take the actual shots, I feel very much the author of the final composite image.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result, he wrote, is that the images of the ''exquisitely flawed pearl'' that is Europa and the ''lurid and orange and volcanic'' Io provide ''something stranger than 'Star Trek' or 'Star Wars' ever came up with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked whether there was any message he would like to get across with the photographs, he began with a joke, ''Uh, that they're for sale?'' (They are.) But he switched to a more serious tone to say there were earthly lessons in the extraterrestrial sights. ''Venus is the victim of a runaway greenhouse effect, with solar radiation that's trapped by its clouds producing a heat on its surface hot enough to melt lead,'' he wrote. ''Mars by contrast lost much of its atmosphere and is a frigid desert. Both once had surface oceans, which they have entirely lost.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth, of course, is not likely to see anything that extreme. As with real estate values, planetary comfort is largely a matter of location, location, location -- in the solar system. But as visual metaphors for environmental extremes, Mr. Benson's images nonetheless have a way of taking hold in the mind.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alien planet that appeared to be dry, dark and dusty has water in its atmosphere, an astronomer said yesterday, but some of the astronomers who had made the earlier observations said his conclusions might be premature.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as HD 209458b, circles a Sun-like star about 150 light-years away in Pegasus, passing between its star and Earth every 3.6 days. Last winter, two teams using the Spitzer Space Telescope failed to find signs of water in its atmosphere, causing consternation among planetary theorists.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All their models indicate that water vapor is one of the fundamental elements of planetary composition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new work, Travis Barman of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., made numerical models of the planet's atmosphere, assuming there was water. Dr. Barman then compared them with measurements made with the Hubble Space Telescope when light was shining through the edge of the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of its star.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble observations were made by a team led by Heather Knutson, a graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The correlation between the bumps and wiggles predicted and observed, Dr. Barman said, ''is a powerful clue that water is present.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without water, the results would not match, he said in an e-mail message. ''Water has been predicted to be present by many models (not just mine) for a long time,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Barman said the earlier Spitzer observations, which were announced in February, might have failed to find water because they were made when the planet was passing behind its star, fully illuminated from the front. That situation, observers say, could make it difficult to see water even if it were there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Charbonneau of Harvard, a member of Ms. Knutson's team and a longtime student of the planet, called Dr. Barman's results ''intriguing,'' but cautioned that he might be misreading the Hubble results, which were published in the Astrophysical Journal in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper, Dr. Charbonneau said, pointed out that some of the Hubble data might be due to the telescope and instrument, not the planet.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much-delayed launching of the space shuttle Atlantis is being pushed back again into June as NASA struggles to repair thousands of gouges on the craft's hail-pocked fuel tank, officials said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was to begin in mid-March, and the shuttle had already been rolled to the launching pad in February when the hailstorm occurred. Much of the shuttle is protected by a gantry that is moved away before launching, but the 15-story-tall external fuel tank, with its distinctive coating of orange insulating foam, pokes out well beyond the top of the structure.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delicate foam at the top of the tank suffered thousands of dings. Many have to be carved out and filled, one at a time, with new foam. Two areas of the tank were so peppered that workers were spraying on whole sections of foam, a process that had not been tried before at Kennedy Space Center. NASA has put that process through extensive testing to ensure that it is safe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials had hoped that the mission might begin in May, but the pace of repair made that impossible, they said last night. They had also been weighing whether to swap the damaged tank for one that was intended for a later flight, which would have caused further delay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling foam is a threat to the safety of the shuttle and its crew. In 2003, the shuttle Columbia and its crew were lost during the return to Earth because of a hole in the wing caused by a chunk of foam during ascent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay means a later return to Earth for Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who is aboard the International Space Station. Commander Williams's return was scheduled for the shuttle mission after this one, which was to occur in June. With the June launching of Atlantis, the next mission will not be until August at the earliest. William H. Gerstenmaier, who heads manned space operations for NASA, said the agency might bring Commander Williams back on the earlier flight if it was delayed ''into July or later.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for getting Atlantis off the pad by June, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, ''We don't see any showstoppers in front of us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to push the launching into June also casts doubt on NASA's plans for four shuttle missions this year, down from the five missions first announced. N. Wayne Hale Jr., the manager of the shuttle program, said, ''Flying four flights is not outside the realm of possibility.''   </p>

At 33, he slipped away from the safety of a large corporation, Xerox, in search of fortune at a young start-up named Microsoft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today, at 58, that fortune is allowing him to slip the surly bonds of Earth, at least for a couple of weeks, to visit the International Space Station.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simonyi is the fifth so-called space tourist -- a phrase those who buy the flights dislike -- and by a large margin the wealthiest. A software pioneer who led the teams that gave the world Microsoft Word and Excel, he has amassed a personal fortune of about a billion dollars, according to Forbes Magazine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of wealth has bought him two jets -- which he pilots himself -- and a 233-foot-yacht, along with other expensive toys. In comparison to an average American family's worth, the estimated $20 million he paid to blast off in a Soyuz spacecraft is the equivalent to something like a visit to an amusement park or a weekend getaway.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A trip to outer space is actually, for someone like Charles, a logical step,'' Martha Stewart said in an e-mail message from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, where she has gone to see her friend launched into space and to film the event for her television program. Ms. Stewart called Dr. Simonyi ''intrepid, inquisitive, curious and actually very bold,'' adding that his adventure had created a wish to take a trip of her own.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those with less means than Ms. Stewart to buy a ticket can follow Dr. Simonyi's trip on his Web site, CharlesinSpace.com, which details the months of preparation for the flight, including gaining zero-gravity experience aboard an airplane, survival training, working in a spacesuit and practicing helicopter rescues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He follows four other space tourists -- Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen and Anousheh Ansari -- whose trips were arranged by  <span class="companylink">Space Adventures Ltd.</span>, a company in Vienna, Va.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview from Russia, Dr. Simonyi said he would spend his time in space photographing Earth and taking part in experiments. Many involve things like blood tests, he said, so ''I'm more the experimental subject than the experimenter.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has prepared for the possibility of the nausea many space voyagers encounter with Russian conditioning methods that include riding in a spinning chair and sleeping with his legs elevated above his head. ''It's one of those don't try-it-at-home things,'' he said, explaining that it left his head feeling bloated and heavy. ''It's the feeling that you're going to get a headache, but you don't.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like any good guest, he will take a gift: takeout. Ms. Stewart selected the menu, and Alain Ducasse, the French chef, prepared it for April 12, Cosmonauts Day in Russia. The meal includes quail roasted in Madiran wine, duck breast confit with capers and semolina cake with dried apricots.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simonyi will fly up with Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov, both Russian cosmonauts, and return with Mikhail Tyurin, a cosmonaut, and Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, who are finishing their six-month mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip caps a lifelong interest in space and technology for Dr. Simonyi. At 13, he won a contest to be Hungary's ''junior astronaut'' and met a cosmonaut in Moscow. As a student, he punched holes in paper tape to program the Soviet Ural-2 computer. Wanting to read English-language accounts of the United States' space program, he said, was ''one of my motivations in learning English.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His interest stayed strong; in his first year at Microsoft, he persuaded another space enthusiast, Paul G. Allen, to fly to Florida for the first space shuttle launching. Mr. Allen, now one of the world's richest men, has pursued his own interest in space by paying for the development of SpaceShipOne, the small craft that won the Ansari X Prize in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simonyi said that he admired those who were trying to bring about a new space industry, but that when it came to space: ''I am not an entrepreneur. I'm a customer.'' (His company, Intentional Software, is creating a product to simplify the process of writing computer programs.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tech-millionaire-turned-space-entrepreneur, Elon Musk, said that being a private astronaut ''does not do much to advance the greater cause of space exploration,'' which he said was best furthered by companies like his, SpaceX, which has won a NASA contract to ferry astronauts to the space station after the space shuttle program shuts down in 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Simonyi's part, he said he was just happy to be finally on his way. He said he fully understood the risks of space travel, like the station's being hit by orbital space debris, but added that in relative terms, ''the actual risk is very small.'' Besides, he said, ''if you ask whether I'd like to be in a head-on collision on the freeway or be hit by orbital debris, it's the latter.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, to tie his past to his present adventure, he is taking a paper tape from the Ural-2 with him to orbit.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much effort should we expend to ward off the possibility that an asteroid might some day collide with Earth? Space experts attending a recent conference in Washington lamented the failure of the federal government -- indeed, of the entire world -- to take the threat seriously enough. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at virtually the same moment, advised Congress on steps that could be taken to find and divert threatening asteroids only to conclude that it couldn't afford them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems shortsighted. The risk is remote, but the consequences are potentially catastrophic. It would seem wise, at a minimum, to look harder for any death-dealing rocks that might menace us.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The encouraging news is that the most horrendous hazards -- asteroids like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs or even smaller objects whose impact could disrupt the global environment -- have mostly been identified under a $4 million-a-year survey program. The space agency estimates that there are some 1,100 near-Earth objects whose diameters exceed six-tenths of a mile, big enough to destroy a medium-sized state and kick up enough dust to affect global climate and crop production. The survey has already identified more than 700 of them. None are on a path to collide with Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More troublesome is the threat of smaller asteroids, greater than 460 feet in diameter (about one-seventh the threshold of the really scary big ones), that could devastate a region but not the whole globe. NASA estimates that some 20,000 of these might be potentially hazardous; it has identified only a fraction of them. Two years ago Congress asked NASA to propose new search programs and to analyze ways to divert any asteroids on a collision course with Earth. The agency did that in a March report to Congress, but it balked at the notion of spending up to $1 billion or more to build search instruments or spacecraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is understandable. NASA is burdened with the need to finish the space station, build a successor to the shuttles, return to the moon and conduct wide-ranging research. It already has more jobs to perform than money to perform them. But finding asteroids that might threaten the planet, and studying their characteristics in the process, is probably more important than at least some of the other robotic missions mounted by NASA. Congress should either add funds to the agency's budget, or the agency should divert funds from other programs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing ways to deflect asteroids is more problematic. NASA suggests that the best solution would be to explode a nuclear bomb next to an asteroid to deflect it off course, but international aversion to nuclear weapons in space would make that approach difficult without a global consensus. Other experts favor a high-speed ballistic impact or using the gravitational attraction of a hovering spacecraft to nudge the asteroid off course. Before plunging ahead with an asteroid-deflector, let's wait to see whether a real threat even exists.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting's mission had undeniable heft. His experiment would sift cosmic rays, the high energy particles from the Sun, other stars and even galaxies whizzing through outer space, with unprecedented sensitivity and precision, opening in effect a new window on the universe. By looking for the evil twin opposites of ordinary matter, he and his collaborators hoped to shed light on why the universe appears to be made overwhelmingly of matter, although the laws of physics, including Einstein's E=mc2, suggest that matter and antimatter should have been born in equal amounts in the Big Bang. Are there reservoirs of antimatter somewhere way out in space? </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of a few antigold nuclei or antihelium ions streaming from an antistar in some distant antigalaxy would rock science, but even if they didn't find antimatter, Dr. Ting and his team argued that they might detect signals from the mysterious dark matter that accounts for 25 percent of the universe, or see some other significant surprise. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't know what you are going to get,'' he told Science magazine in 1996. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after more than 10 years and $1.5 billion, the 15,000-pound detector is nearly ready for the cosmos, the product of 500 scientists from 56 institutions and 16 countries, including China and Taiwan, welded together by Dr. Ting's organizational energy. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, as it is known, is one of the most expensive scientific experiments ever built. A blue-ribbon panel of physicists appointed by the Energy Department affirmed last fall that the instrument had the potential to make ''fundamental new discoveries.'' By the end of next year, the project's managers expect to ship it to the Kennedy Space Center. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only hitch is that NASA says it no longer has the space to fly its once-prized project. The experiment was dropped from the space shuttle manifest after the Columbia burned up in 2003 and NASA shifted gear and decided to retire the shuttles by 2010. All the remaining flights are booked, either to finish the space station or to revisit the Hubble Space Telescope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So absent a change of heart by NASA, or the infusion of more money, Dr. Ting's experiment could languish for all eternity in a NASA clean room. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope that's not true,'' Dr. Ting said by telephone from CERN, the nuclear laboratory outside Geneva where the detector is being assembled, adding that as a particle physicist he reported to the Department of Energy, not NASA. ''My responsibility is to build the detector.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''I hope it gets used, otherwise it would not be good for everyone.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the experiment itself, the standoff represents a clash between two of the more strong-willed and brilliant leaders of Big Science in America: Dr. Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is known for his autocratic management style and obsession with detail, and Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, who has shown himself willing to make tough calls in reshaping the space program away from the shuttle and toward the Moon and Mars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The loss of Columbia was a huge loss for the entire United States space program aside from the deaths of seven people,'' Dr. Griffin said recently in an interview. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sam is the one guy we deal with who has not accepted this with reasonable grace,'' he said. ''He continues to insist that he is a special case. I'm sorry, but he's not.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another level, many scientists say, the standoff is a test of American credibility in international science. NASA signed an ''implementing arrangement'' with the Department of Energy in 1995, agreeing to fly the Alpha experiment on the station if the department built it. It was on the basis of that document, and a 1998 memorandum of understanding signed by representatives of some two dozen institutions around the world, Dr. Ting says, that scientists from Europe and Asia were able to raise money from their governments for the detector. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Smoot, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and Nobel laureate himself, who served on the blue-ribbon review panel, said, ''The real issue is does NASA stand up to its commitments to the D.O.E. and the rest of the world?'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology, who led the recent review, said, ''It's a crime to make that kind of investment and then walk away from it.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paradoxically, NASA has cited international commitments as a reason to complete the space station. Mark Sistilli, NASA's project manager for the experiment, noted that it too is ''a major, major international project.'' He emphasized that it had not been canceled and that NASA would continue to get the experiment ready just in case. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Energy declined to comment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting, who won the Nobel in 1976 for his part in discovering the so-called J/Psi particle in 1974, conceived the idea for his space antimatter experiment in 1993 after the United States canceled a giant particle accelerator, the Superconducting Supercollider, narrowing the options for traditional high-energy physics on the Earth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting decided to look instead to the sky. ''The highest energy particles are only produced with cosmic rays,'' he said. ''No matter how large an accelerator you have, you can never compete with cosmic rays.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Daniel S. Goldin, NASA's administrator at the time, Dr. Ting's idea was heaven-sent, and he put it on the fast track to space. Not only would it add cutting-edge science to the space station, but it would cost NASA little beyond a pair of shuttle flights. Under the agreement, the Department of Energy was responsible for building and testing the detector. Indeed, the vast bulk of the $1.5 billion for the project, Dr. Ting said, came from Europe and Asia. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heart of his experiment is the two-ton magnet. Its field, 20,000 times as strong as that at the Earth's surface, is produced by current flowing through superconducting coils cooled to 1.8 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero. That was what took 12 years and cost so much money, Dr. Ting said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A magnet is essential because charged cosmic rays bend direction in a magnetic field. By measuring the degree and direction of the bend, physicists can identify the cosmic particles. Protons and antiprotons would bend in opposite directions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Dr. Ting said, is that magnets in orbit tend to rotate to stay aligned with the Earth's own magnetic field as they go around the Earth. That would wreck the experiment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It took us some time to design a magnet that won't turn,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting's group flew a prototype of their experiment successfully on the shuttle in 1998. The second flight was to be three years on the space station. But delays in the shuttle schedule and the Columbia disaster intervened. Last year an Italian-led collaboration launched a smaller cosmic ray satellite named Pamela that has begun to nibble away at some of the science the Alpha spectrometer was supposed to do. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Dr. Griffin became NASA administrator in April 2005, however, the experiment, he said, had been dropped from the shuttle manifest. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months after taking office, he received a briefing from Dr. Ting. Dr. Griffin was unmoved about the use of the shuttle. ''It essentially uses up most of a shuttle flight,'' he said of the experiment. ''Without adding a flight, we don't have the payload.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he subsequently asked Mr. Sistilli to look into alternative ways to get the experiment to space. But the possibilities, ranging from launching it on an unmanned rocket and leaving it parked in space until the shuttle could pick it up, to making it into a free-flying satellite, would cost anywhere from $225 million to $1 billion, Mr. Sistilli said. Asked who would pay, Mr. Sistilli said, ''That's the big question.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, he said, is still pondering what to do. ''The science and the international commitment are something you can't ignore,'' Mr. Sistilli said. ''Stay tuned.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since those days, a whole generation has known space travel only by the shuttle, its orbital perambulations practically terrestrial by comparison. But in a quarter-century of blastoffs here, that bulky, snub-nosed, imperfect craft has gained its own set of admirers and collectors along this space coast.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We watched this huge monument leave the planet. It was awesome; it was goose bumps,'' said Brenda Mulberry, owner of the Space Shirts souvenir shop. ''Every one's been just as exciting to me.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes the long goodbye.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On presidential orders to return to lunar exploration, NASA has vowed to retire its shuttle fleet by 2010, leaving the last scheduled missions to the whims of weather, mechanics and luck. The next launching of the Atlantis awaits repairs to the bruises from an earthbound storm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because the spaceflights are sporadic, there's 14 of them left if I'm not wrong,'' said Scott Andrews, a camera company representative who developed a trigger system for photographing active launching pads. ''People are looking at the big draw for the area now as the cruise ports.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around Merritt Island and the nearby towns about 45 miles east of Orlando, the impending shuttle retirement can evoke memories of 1972, when the end of the Apollo program set parts of the local economy adrift. But today the side-by-side hotels of Cocoa Beach are filled with college students on spring break, the Denny's restaurants are filled with retired couples, and the Port Canaveral billboards list the departures of five cruise lines. It is not Walt Disney World East, but then, the century is young.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all that business, the space shuttle occupies the kind of sentimental hole other cities plug with sports franchises. After 116 missions, several triumphs, two great disasters and a general loss of interest in many quarters of the country, hope, resolve and some measure of nostalgia resound in a place where the telephone area code is 3-2-1 and where, the tourism board says, ''dreams are launched.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has announced intentions to deploy a new craft called Orion by 2015, and Ms. Mulberry has already started rendering it on T-shirts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This new rocket is a little difficult, I will tell you,'' she said, holding a design that incorporated pictures of Earth, the Moon, some satellites and a couple of manatees. ''It's not as pretty as the shuttle.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mulberry came here in the early days of the shuttle program and found a husband at Bernard's Surf, a legendary astronaut haunt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He told me he worked on the space shuttle,'' she said. ''I laughed at him. I said, 'What's a space shuttle?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today a rocking two-seater shuttle replica sits outside her store, and an inflatable shuttle hangs from the ceiling. ''The T-shirts will continue, whether they build a new vehicle or they don't,'' Ms. Mulberry said. ''But I believe they will. I believe we're going to the Moon again.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Indian River in Titusville, where the better bars advertise ''Bikers Welcome,'' the Shuttle Car Wash and Space Shuttle Fuels pay modest tribute. The Columbia and the Challenger are depicted on license plates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Best Western Space Shuttle Inn, Room 178 has a bed with a distinctive black-and-white nose for a headboard and rudders and elevons at the base. A portal on the wall depicts Earth as seen from space. The room costs $139 a night, a $60 premium over its neighbors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes locals will call up and say, 'Hey, you got the space shuttle room open?' '' said Cindy Schellenberg, a desk agent. ''People stay here on full nights and say, 'That's the weirdest room I've ever stayed in.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decor dates to a long-ago owner whose name has slipped Ms. Schellenberg's mind, a Dutchman who drove a shuttle replica built atop a motorcycle. The hotel, she said, will probably keep its name.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hate to see the shuttle program end, but there's always enthusiasm for the next step,'' Ms. Schellenberg said. ''I'd like to see them go to the Moon.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the road to the launching pad, Shuttles Bar and Grill is decorated with eight-foot portraits of the craft in flight. A sign on the door says ''Shoes and Shirt Required; No One Under 21 After 9 p.m.; Non-Smoking Not Available.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the place is a roadhouse of the classic American style, complete with barn ceiling, pool table and lighting fixtures by Budweiser. In some photographs astronauts pose in orange flight suits and 1980s haircuts; in others the shuttle and its rocket boosters roar into cloudless skies trailed by golden plumes of fire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope they don't shut it down, because that's why we're here,'' said a waitress, Kim Kolata, 24. ''I remember, as a kid, coming up here. The shuttle launch would go off. You'd feel the ground shake. It was pretty exciting.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kolata was reminded of NASA's plan to return to the Moon, an adventure that has not been tried in her lifetime, not since the days of the fearless test pilots who drank at the Moon Hut. She gazed away for a second, seeming to gather her thoughts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do you think,'' she asked, ''they really went to the Moon?''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazingly, the pieces that flew apart from that long ago smash-up are still easily identifiable in the night sky, astronomers reported last week.   </p>

Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of an article describing the discovery in the current issue of the journal Nature.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown turned up the first piece in December 2004 during a systematic search for large bodies hiding beyond Neptune in a ring of debris known as the Kuiper Belt. Given the time of year, he gave that Kuiper Belt object the nickname Santa. (A couple of weeks later, the same search turned up a Kuiper Belt object larger than Pluto, precipitating the events that led to the demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet last year.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa, with a mass about one-third that of Pluto, is an oddball. It is shaped like a football, stretched out because it spins end over end once every four hours. It is made mostly of rock, but has an outer layer of shiny water ice. It has two moons, nicknamed ''Rudolph'' and ''Blitzen.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid spinning and the two moons were hints of a past collision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Kristina M. Barkume, one of Dr. Brown's graduate students, was measuring the reflectivity of about 30 Kuiper Belt objects to infrared light. Six were noticeably different, absorbing a specific wavelength corresponding to the presence of ice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them was Santa, which is also known by the more formal designation 2003 EL61.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists looked up the orbits of the other five Kuiper Belt objects on the list. ''It was instantaneously obvious,'' Dr. Brown said. '' 'Oh my God, these things all have the same orbit, and they have the exact same orbit as Santa.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers have since found two additional Kuiper Belt objects that are shards from the same impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculations suggest that the pre-impact Santa was about 1,000 miles wide, or about two-thirds the width of Pluto. It collided with another object perhaps 700 miles wide at a speed of perhaps 7,000 miles per hour. That impact pulverized most of Santa's outer layers of ice, leaving the rocky core, Dr. Brown said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's telling us something very important about the early evolution of the solar system, and we're still trying to figure that out,'' said Harold F. Levison, a planetary scientist at the  <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s department of space studies in Boulder, Colo. ''It was a surprise, no doubt about it. When I first heard about it, I didn't believe it, but the paper convinced me.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kuiper Belt is believed to have once been much denser and originally closer to the Sun, but was later pushed outward by the migration of the giant planets like Neptune. However, those changes would have pushed apart the orbits of Santa and its brethren, so the observation that all are still in the same orbit means the collision that formed them must have occurred after the Kuiper Belt settled in its current location, Dr. Levison said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That in turn brings up the question of how seemingly unlikely it was that the collision occurred at all. Only a handful of objects in the current Kuiper Belt are larger than 500 miles wide, and it is highly unlikely that two would ever cross paths.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levison said he had worked out a possible solution. In the past, a higher number of Kuiper Belt objects traveled in elliptical orbits, and two of those must have been the ones that collided.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa will not be around forever. It is in a resonant orbit with Neptune, traveling around the Sun 7 times for each 12 orbits of Neptune. That resonance is unstable, and in about a billion years, Neptune will give Santa a gravitational push into the inner solar system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Santa can make it past Jupiter, which deflects many such interlopers from the outer solar system, it will turn into a giant comet. ''It'll be most spectacular thing that anyone has ever seen -- if anyone is around to see it,'' Dr. Brown said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other fragments must have also been kicked inward by Neptune, which raises the possibility that at least some observed comets are also pieces of Santa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is pure speculation,'' Dr. Brown said. But he added, ''That's one of the things I like to think about that might be really true.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''When Worlds Collide''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simulations can help scientists understand the dynamics of collisions in deep space. In this example, two objects, each about 2,000 kilometers in diameter, collide at low speed, ejecting about 1 percent of their mass into space.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TIBURON, Calif. -- AMERICANS who read the papers or watch Jay Leno have been aware for some time now that there is a slim but real possibility -- about 1 in 45,000 -- that an 850-foot-long asteroid called Apophis could strike Earth with catastrophic consequences on April 13, 2036. What few probably realize is that there are thousands of other space objects that could hit us in the next century that could cause severe damage, if not total destruction.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week two events in Washington -- a conference on ''planetary defense'' held by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the release by NASA of a report titled ''Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives'' -- gave us good news and bad on this front. On the promising side, scientists have a good grasp of the risks of a cosmic fender-bender, and have several ideas that could potentially stave off disaster. Unfortunately, the government doesn't seem to have any clear plan to put this expertise into action.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, Congress gave NASA's Spaceguard Survey program a mandate of ''discovering, tracking, cataloging and characterizing'' 90 percent of the near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer (3,200 feet) wide by 2008. An object that size could devastate a small country and would probably destroy civilization.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus at the conference was that the initial survey is doing fairly well although it will probably not quite meet the 2008 goal. Realizing that there are many smaller but still terribly destructive asteroids out there, Congress has modified the Spaceguard goal to identify 90 percent of even smaller objects -- 460 feet and larger -- by 2020. This revised survey, giving us decades of early warning, will go a long way toward protecting life on the planet in the future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that scientists feel we have the technology to intercept and deflect many asteroids headed toward Earth. Basically, if we have early enough warning, a robotic space mission could slightly change the orbit of a dangerous asteroid so that it would subsequently miss the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two potential deflection techniques appear to work nicely together -- first we would deflect the asteroid with kinetic impact from a missile (that is, running into it); then we would use the slight pull of a ''gravity tractor'' -- a satellite that would hover near the asteroid -- to fine-tune its new trajectory to our liking. (In the case of an extremely large object, probably one in 100, the missile might have to contain a nuclear warhead.) To be effective, however, such missions would have to be launched 15 or even 30 years before a calculated impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news? While this all looks fine on paper, scientists haven't had a chance to try it in practice. And this is where NASA's report was supposed to come in. Congress directed the agency in 2005 to come up with a program, a budget to support it and an array of alternatives for preventing an asteroid impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of coming up with a plan and budget to get the job done, the report bluntly stated that ''due to current budget constraints, NASA cannot initiate a new program at this time.'' Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, was right to say that ''NASA's recommended approach isn't a credible plan'' and that Congress expected ''a more responsive approach'' within the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did the space agency drop the ball? Like all government departments, it fears the dreaded ''unfunded mandate''; Congress has the habit of directing agencies to do something and then declining to give them the money to do so. This is understandable. But in this case, Congress not only directed NASA to provide it with a recommended program but also asked for the estimated budget to support it. It was a left-handed way for the Congress to say to NASA that this is our priority like it or not. But for some reason NASA seems to have opted for a federal form of civil disobedience.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with the report was that, while it outlined other possibilities, it estimated that using a nuclear-armed missile to divert an asteroid would be ''10 to 100 times more effective'' than non-nuclear approaches. It is possible that in some cases -- such as an asteroid greater than a third of a mile across -- the nuclear option might be necessary. But for the overwhelming majority of potential deflection cases, using a nuclear warhead would be like a golfer swinging away with his driver to sink a three-foot putt; the bigger bang is not always better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the concern? First, even with good intentions, launching a nuclear-armed missile would violate the international agreements by which all weaponry is banned from space. Second, the laws of probability say we would be struck by such a large asteroid only once every 200,000 years -- that's a long time to keep a standing arsenal of nuclear asteroid-blasters, and raises all sorts of possibilities of accidents or sabotage -- the old ''cure being worse than the disease'' phenomenon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, of course, this is not just America's problem, as an asteroid strike would be felt around the globe. The best course is international coordination on deflection technology, along with global agreements on what should be done if a collision looks likely. Along these lines, the Association of Space Explorers, a group of more than 300 people from 30 nations who have flown in space (of which I am a member), is beginning a series of meetings in cooperation with the United Nations to work out the outlines of such an agreement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as with many global issues, little will be accomplished unless the United States takes the lead. With the entire planet in the cross hairs, NASA can't be allowed to dither. If Congress's mandates and budget requests aren't energizing the agency, perhaps public hearings would shame it into action.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 11 -- NASA can find and track most of the nearby asteroids that could hit and damage the Earth, but there is not enough money in its budget to finish the project within a 15-year deadline mandated by Congress, according to an agency report released Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said there were about 20,000 asteroids and comets orbiting relatively close to our planet that could deliver blows ranging from destroying cities to ending all life.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These objects, 150 yards to more than a mile in diameter, represent about 20 percent of the asteroids and comets whose paths routinely pass between the Sun and the Earth's orbit, it said. Rather than trying to detect, track, catalog and characterize all of the more than 100,000 ''near Earth objects,'' as Congress asked in a 2005 NASA authorization bill, the study said it would be more realistic to focus on those representing a real potential hazard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But accomplishing this by 2020 would require using ground-based telescopes sponsored by other agencies for other purposes, possibly building a dedicated observatory for finding and tracking hazardous bodies and launching a spacecraft to observe the space around Earth from Venus. Such an undertaking, the report said, would cost more than $1 billion that the agency does not have.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Due to current budget constraints, NASA cannot initiate a new program at this time,'' it said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA runs a program called the Spaceguard Survey to track the largest potentially hazardous objects, those greater than 3,300 feet in diameter that could devastate most life if they hit. That is what scientists believe happened to the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago. This program, using ground-based observatories, is budgeted at $4.1 million a year through 2012.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald K. Yeomans, director of the Spaceguard program, said that there were believed to be 1,100 of these larger objects and that the survey had cataloged about 73 percent of them. The initial goal of tracking 90 percent of them should be reached by 2010, more than a year later than originally planned, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yeomans, attending a planetary defense conference here last week at George Washington University, said the goal of surveying 90 percent of potentially hazardous objects could be reached more cheaply than in the NASA study by using only ground-based observatories. But Congress would have to change its goal from 2020 to 2026, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building, launching and operating a deep space orbiting infrared observatory to complete the task more quickly could cost an additional $700 million, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Ailor of the Aerospace Corporation, a not-for-profit Air Force research group that sponsored the planetary defense conference, said the problem of finding killer asteroids could be solved more easily if more countries were involved. Interest is growing, he said, noting that the European Space Agency is considering a mission called Don Quijote to test ways to deflect an asteroid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Should one nation, the United States, be responsible for the entire planet?'' Mr. Ailor asked.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency currently supports several search programs that use telescopes to find objects over a kilometer (about sixth-tenths of a mile) in diameter that cross the Earth's orbit. There are an estimated 1,000 of them, and about three-quarters have been discovered, their orbits calculated, and the potential for global catastrophe ruled out.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a report to Congress, NASA said that because of budget constraints, it could not undertake any new programs to find smaller asteroids, up to about 450 feet in diameter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists who study near-Earth objects say the collision risk is very real. But the odds of a major impact in the average lifetime is very low -- perhaps 1 in 100,000, according to David Morrison, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center who is an authority on impact hazards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morrison said he preferred not to talk about risk but about the need to find whatever is out there. ''It's like walking across Broadway with your eyes closed,'' he said. ''You'd rather look and see. We're not looking and seeing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that even a 450-foot-diameter asteroid would cause major destruction, Dr. Morrison and others spend time thinking about what to do if a space rock is found to have the planet's number on it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference last week in Washington, the latest ideas were discussed. One was using a nuclear bomb to blow up a rogue asteroid, as Bruce Willis did in the 1998 film, ''Armageddon.'' He landed on the asteroid and drilled into the rock, leaving a bomb behind.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But asteroids are thought to be odd rocks -- porous agglomerations of smaller bits, more like popcorn balls than baseballs. A nuclear blast from within an asteroid might simply break it into several pieces that could continue on the same trajectory and do as much or more damage to Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option would be a nuclear detonation on the asteroid's surface or above it. Such a blast would cause some of the rock on one side to vaporize and send the asteroid in the other direction. Given enough lead time, even a slight course change would be more than enough to send the rock out of harm's way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another scheme calls for a ballistic impact -- hurling a few tons of nonexplosive material at high speed at the asteroid to knock it off course. There's also the gravity tractor, a hovering spacecraft that would use only its gravitational pull to tug the rock into a different orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other ideas are less practical. Perhaps the most far-fetched is a proposal to change the color of the asteroid, making it darker or lighter so that it absorbs and re-radiates more or less sunlight, affecting its spin and, eventually, its orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most scientists consider this idea intriguing but unrealistic, a paper in the current issue of the journal Science shows that the effect of sunlight on small asteroids, while slight, is significant. So it's not unfathomable that someday the survival of the planet could depend on what might be called the Rolling Stones approach: ''I see an asteroid, and I want it painted black.''

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 -- The craft that is to replace the space shuttle could be delayed because of recent budget reductions, pushing its first missions into 2015 instead of 2014, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, told a Senate committee on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said the reductions could shift money from the development of the Orion crew vehicle and the Ares I rocket. That would widen by four to six months the period in which the United States could not send humans into space after the shuttle is retired in 2010.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said other nations would continue to fly people and cargo into space while the United States was grounded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the United States not to be among them is tragic,'' he said, adding: ''When you don't fly for four or more years, people become stale. Very good people often move into other enterprises where there is more action. Facilities degrade. It's not a good thing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the hearing, before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Mr. Griffin said a chance remained that the Orion's first missions could come in December 2014. But he warned that it would not be possible if early development money was reduced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the committee's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the ranking Republican, repeated their hope for limiting the ''gap'' in American manned space flight. Mr. Nelson said that it was a national security issue and that he would push for more money for the shuttle replacement in a supplemental spending bill this spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration has proposed a $17.3 billion budget for NASA in the 2008 fiscal year, a 3 percent increase over the previous year. Mr. Griffin said the proposal demonstrated President Bush's commitment to space leadership and was enough to keep NASA on track.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said NASA's biggest planning problem was the resolution the president signed on Feb. 15 that froze 2007 spending at the previous year's level because Congress had not passed separate spending bills before the end of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appropriation reduces overall NASA financing by $545 million from the original 2007 request. In addition, Mr. Griffin said, the measure directed $677 million in specific reductions in the agency's human space flight budget, including $577 million from the program developing the Orion, to be redistributed to other NASA programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is that we are down about half a billion dollars, and most of that came from the Orion Program,'' Mr. Griffin said. Developing the Orion will cost $10 billion, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said NASA was studying a space station safety report released on Tuesday by an independent panel of experts. The report noted risks to the International Space Station from orbiting debris and micrometeoroids, among other concerns. NASA had already been working on most of those problems, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every day, there is about a one in 100,000 chance that the space station will be critically damaged by a piece of orbital debris,'' Mr. Griffin said, ''It's not great, but the risk is there.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has postponed next month's space shuttle launching because of thousands of dings and gouges from a hailstorm, mission managers announced yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hailstorm, which caught the shuttle at the launching pad, caused ''the worst damage we have ever seen'' to the insulating foam on the shuttle's external fuel tank, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, in a briefing from Cape Canaveral, Fla. There were two dozen blemishes on the left wing of the shuttle Atlantis, though preliminary analysis suggests no serious damage.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hailstorm blew through the Kennedy Space Center at 5 p.m. on Monday with wind gusts of 62 miles per hour and golf-ball-sized hail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is, at this point we do not believe we can make the launch window for March,'' Mr. Hale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle will have to be rolled back to the hangar for assessment and repairs, missing a launching opportunity for a construction mission to the International Space Station that begins on March 15 and extends to March 25. The next opportunity would come after a visit to the station by a Russian Soyuz vehicle in April, so the earliest launching will not come until late April, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If NASA has to swap out the current external tank, Mr. Hale said, the mission would be delayed until June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the shuttle was protected by a gantry at the launching pad, the top of the tank extends well above the structure and sustained the greatest damage, said John Chapman, the manager of the external tank project office for the space agency. The number of ''divots'' might be as high as 7,000, Mr. Chapman said, but far fewer would require repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some shallow dings can be sanded smooth, while others will be filled with pourable insulating foam and sanded. The damage to the wing's insulating tiles might require cosmetic repairs, though further assessment will take place, officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foam that covers the external tank has been a source of risk and worry for the space program since the earliest days, because foam falling can damage the delicate thermal tiles and panels that protect the orbiter from the punishing heat of re-entry. The shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven were lost in February 2003 after a chunk of insulating foam struck the left wing during ascent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttles have sustained hailstorm damage that required repairs and delay before two other missions, in 1990 and in 1999. In the 1999 mission, NASA counted 460 divots, said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for the Kennedy Space Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that despite the latest delay he believed that the launching scheldule had enough flexibility to allow the five flights that are planned for this year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The half-ton, atomic-powered robot craft is to make more than 700 observations of Jupiter and its four largest moons by June. A period of high-intensity observations began last Saturday and will peak after the craft makes its closest approach to Jupiter on Wednesday, passing 1.4 million miles from the center of the giant planet.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter's gravity will accelerate the spacecraft by 9,000 miles per hour, flinging it toward Pluto at 52,000 miles per hour. Even with the speed boost, which knocks off three years of travel time, New Horizons will take eight more years to reach the Pluto system for a close-up look in July 2015, when Pluto will be 3 billion miles from Earth, a distance requiring almost four and a half hours for a radio signal to pass between them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our highest priority is to get the spacecraft safely through the gravity assist and on its way to Pluto,'' said Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the mission's principal scientist and team leader. ''But this is also a big stress test for our primary mission to Pluto. We want to exercise our spacecraft hard enough to turn up any problems and to fully test our procedures.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons is powered by a small plutonium-fueled electric generator, and its instruments include three cameras, for visible-light, infrared and ultraviolet images, a space-dust collector and three spectrometers to study the chemical composition and temperatures of the worlds it investigates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Spencer, a mission scientist who is also from the Southwest Research Institute, said New Horizons carried more advanced instruments than any of the seven spacecraft that previously visited Jupiter and would be making unique observations. ''We will not be repeating what has already been done,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists plan for the spacecraft to make three-dimensional movies of the turbulent area near Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot, a centuries-old giant hurricane; examine auroras above the atmosphere in different wavelengths of light; and make the first edge-on observations of the planet's tenuous ring system in hopes of finding some tiny satellites there, Dr. Spencer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will also make a major study of Jupiter's enormous magnetosphere, a cocoon of charged particles from the Sun that are trapped and channeled around the planet by its magnetic field. In the months after the Jupiter fly-by, plans call for New Horizons to make the first trip down the magnetosphere's long tail of high-energy particles that extend tens of millions of miles beyond the planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the data collected during the Jupiter encounter will be recorded aboard the spacecraft and sent back to Earth days or weeks later, just as New Horizons is scheduled to do when it makes its closest pass by Pluto, its large moon Charon and the smaller satellites Nix and Hydra on July 14, 2015.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months after the Jupiter encounter, the $700 million project will go to sleep for much of the cruise period to Pluto. New Horizons will be put into a ''hibernation mode'' with most of its systems and instruments turned off to reduce wear and tear and to save power. Operators are to wake the spacecraft once a year during the long journey to check its status and correct its flight path.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may be that Beta Crucis is so bright that it completely overwhelms the area,'' Mr. Kuhn said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beta Crucis, about 16 times the size of the Sun and 350 light-years from Earth, is brighter than all but 18 stars in the night sky.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Wolk, a staff scientist at the Chandra X-ray Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., who was not involved in the research, said the work ''appears essentially incremental -- most good work is -- but finding a young sun hiding in such a well-known and easy-to-find spot always makes you feel a bit more accepted by the universe.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new star is probably about the size of the Sun and relatively young, at 11 million years old. It is more than 37 billion miles from Beta Crucis, or 400 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This image is evidence that the new X-ray source is a star that is physically associated with the Beta Crucis system,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''But we still need follow-up observations to conclusively prove it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five countries -- Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Samoa -- display the Southern Cross on their flags.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Beta Crucis is a star near the end of its life, according to David Cohen, the lead author of the paper and an associate professor of astronomy at Swarthmore, no one need fear that the designs will become obsolete. Beta Crucis, Dr. Cohen said, will continue to outshine everything nearby for at least the next few million years.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said yesterday that the most extensive examinations yet of the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars was most noteworthy for what they did not see: namely water, a substance predicted by virtually all theories of planet formation, not to mention the essential ingredient for life as we know it.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The steam that was predicted to be there was nowhere to be found,'' said L. Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richardson led one of three teams that reported the results of observations of two planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope in a telephone news conference yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richardson's results are being published in Nature today. His data suggest that at least one of the planets is swaddled in high-level clouds of dark dust. ''The water could still be there,'' he said. ''We just can't see it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the work was another steppingstone in the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Mark Swain at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the leader of a second team, called it ''a dress rehearsal.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was also in keeping with the history of planets orbiting other stars, or extrasolar planets, which has been nothing but a series of surprises over the last 10 years as planetary systems out there have so far looked nothing like our own. Alan Boss, a theorist at the Carnegie Institution who was not involved in the work, said: ''This is a field where observers are leading the way. The scorecard should read, 'Observers 200, Theorists 0.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was a member of a third group, led by Carl J. Grillmair of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, described the extrasolar bodies as ''blacker than any planet in the solar system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a sense,'' Dr. Charbonneau said, ''we're getting our first sniffs of air from an alien world.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of the planets studied are so-called hot Jupiters, gas giants that circle their home stars in tight hot life-defying orbits. And both pass directly in front of their stars and then behind them, as seen from Earth. One, known as HD 209458b, with a surface temperature of about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, circles a Sun-like star about 150 light-years away in Pegasus at a distance of about 5 million miles every 3.6 days. (Mercury, the closest planet to our Sun, is 36 million miles from it.) Five years ago, a group led by Dr. Charbonneau using the Hubble Space Telescope detected traces of sodium in the planet's atmosphere as it was backlighted by its home star.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other planet, known equally charmingly as HD 189733b, is 62 light-years away in Vulpecula, circling a reddish star slightly smaller than the Sun every 2.2 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The groups analyzed the planets' atmospheres by using the Spitzer Space Telescope to record their spectrum of infrared, or heat, radiation. The planets are too overwhelmed by their stars' glare to be imaged directly. But by subtracting Spitzer observations of the star when the planet was behind it from observations when the planet and star were both visible, the astronomers could obtain the spectrum of the planet itself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richardson's group first did this for the Pegasus planet in July 2005, but analyzing the data took longer than it expected. All Spitzer data become public after a year, so Dr. Swain's group took up the analysis as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to theoretical models, molecules like water and carbon dioxide should have produced bumps and wiggles at characteristic wavelengths in the planets' spectrums. Instead, the spectrums were virtually flat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a member of Dr. Richardson's team, said the lack of such features was ''truly exciting.'' Dr. Seager explained that in so-called brown dwarfs, failed stars that are the closest thing to the hot Jupiters, water vapor dominates the spectrum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many ways, she said, that the water could be there but hidden from our view.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea, which has gained some support from Dr. Richardson's analysis, is that high clouds could mask the atmosphere. Dr. Richardson's spectrum has a broad bump at a wavelength of 9.6 microns, which he says is consistent with emission from heated dust grains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Swain said he did not claim to have detected the dust feature.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder, Colo. -- AFTER years of spending our nation's space budget building an orbiting space station of questionable utility, serviced by an operationally expensive space shuttle of unsafe design, NASA has set a new direction for the future of human spaceflight. Once again, we have our sights on the Moon and beyond. We are finally, bodily, going to make our way into space, this time to stay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an opinion long and widely held within the space-exploration community that the Nixon administration's termination of the program that built the Saturn V Moon rocket was a gargantuan mistake.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest challenges in exploring space is propulsion -- that is, getting from point A to B efficiently, safely and quickly. And when the cargo is human, the challenges are even greater. One of our crowning technological achievements during the 1960s was the Apollo program and, in particular, the development of the Saturn V rocket. The Saturn V was the largest, most powerful vehicle the United States had ever built. It had a launching capacity more than five times greater, a developmental cost 25 percent lower and a build-and-operate cost less than half of that of today's space shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those early days, the possibilities for human space travel were intoxicating. Back then, NASA plans called for an aggressive integrated human flight program that would expand on the developments of Apollo: the establishment of a 50-person lunar base, a 100-person Earth-orbiting space station and human landfall on Mars, all by the mid-1980s. Those plans also included a 50-person semi-permanent Martian base by the end of the 20th century. Instead, we went nowhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Because, largely for political reasons, we renounced the Moon, abandoned Apollo and the Saturn V and retreated to low Earth orbit, where we've spent the last 25 years going around in circles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost to the nation of this misstep was enormous. For starters, we lost an investment, adjusted for inflation to 2007 dollars, of $160 billion. That was the cost to get to, land on, walk on, drive on and otherwise explore the Moon. (Of that amount, $29 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, was the approximate cost of the Saturn V.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the production facilities for the Saturn V and the other lunar exploration components, like the command and lunar modules, were all closed. At that point, we lost both the technological means for human deep space exploration and the collective knowledge of tens of thousands of engineers and scientists trained in human spaceflight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally troubling is what we put in place of Apollo. The $38 billion developmental cost of the shuttle has gotten us nowhere in the solar system fast. And the International Space Station could have been built with only half a dozen Saturn V launchings instead of the more than two dozen shuttle trips that will be required to finish it. The bottom line: a colossal misuse of funds and a disheartening lack of progress and loss of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The termination of the Saturn V program also had a stifling effect on the robotic exploration of other planets. In essence, we lost the ability to deliver larger, and in some cases faster, payloads elsewhere in the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, as an example, the 5,600-kilogram Cassini spacecraft, which was launched in 1997 and is now in orbit around Saturn. Its launching was timed so that after spending two years looping around the inner solar system to pick up speed, it could rendezvous with massive Jupiter for an additional boost that would send it to Saturn. All told, its flight time took seven years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the Saturn V, modified with an appropriate fourth upper stage, been used to launch Cassini directly to Jupiter first, its flight time to Saturn could have been cut by more than half. In space, as on Earth, time is money, and the money saved could have been spent elsewhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, for the same flight time, a vehicle of greater launching capacity can deliver a heavier payload. Take as an example the 480-kilogram New Horizons spacecraft, launched over a year ago to fly by Pluto in 2015 and eventually to explore the Kuiper Belt of icy debris that lies beyond it. Had it been launched on a modified Saturn V rocket, New Horizons could have carried a payload that was 15 times heavier and far more scientifically capable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, instead of having a ubiquitous presence throughout the solar system, humans haven't set foot on the Moon in 35 years, and even our robotic explorations in that time have been throttled because we deliberately reduced our access to deep space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, however, NASA is again looking up and out. Vigorous efforts are under way to complete the space station in order to fulfill international commitments that would be unwise to violate. When that is done, the plan is to retire the space shuttle in 2010 in favor of a new program to return to the Moon, with a party of humans, by 2020. A mainstay of this program is the Ares launching system, capable of sending 65 metric tons to the Moon -- exceeding the capacity of the Saturn V by more than 40 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official plans call not for flag-planting and grab-a-few-rocks-and-go but, by 2025, a solar-powered, human-tended, continuously inhabited research outpost rising from either the north or south pole of the Moon, where sunlight is persistent and water ice may be present. Sustainability, made possible in part by the use of lunar resources, is one goal. Another is on-site preparations for a push to the next outpost, Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And human spaceflight is not the only enterprise to benefit. Robotic reconnaissance, which by necessity must precede the dispatch of humans, has been ongoing for nearly 50 years. In that time, all the simple things have been done. Future missions to the planets and their moons will be more ambitious than anything yet tried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one example, imagine what our future robotic travels around Saturn might be like. The Saturn planetary system includes Titan, a cold Mercury-sized moon with a dense, organic-laden, hazy atmosphere and a strangely Earth-like, variegated surface sculptured by winds and hydrocarbon rains. It also includes Enceladus, a moon one-tenth the size of Titan, whose jets of water vapor and fine icy particles extend thousands of miles into space and may very likely erupt from organic-rich liquid water reservoirs just below its surface -- making this satellite arguably the most promising target we have available to us for astrobiological investigation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A scientifically comprehensive mission to this part of the solar system, using Ares and a Cassini-like trajectory to Saturn, could easily include several exploratory vehicles. One would be a Saturn orbiter far more capable than Cassini. This vehicle, in turn, would be large enough to carry and deliver a fully equipped balloon-borne scientific payload to float through the atmosphere of Titan and study its surface up close, and an Enceladus lander with equipment that could determine the moon's physical properties and ascertain whether or not pre-biotic chemistry, and perhaps life, has arisen there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, robotic exploration, and the insights that will be gained from it into the character, development and evolution of planetary bodies and even life itself, will be taken to new heights and, in turn, pave the way for the eventual arrival of humans throughout the solar system. Anyone up for an extreme excursion to the Enceladus Interplanetary Geyser Park?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the subtext is invigorating and unmistakable: Humanity's future need not be confined to mere survival on our home planet. Other worlds beckon, we know how to reach them and we will once more be outward bound.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we will not be alone. China, India and Russia, all eager to be or remain prominent players on the world stage, have independent plans to stride the lunar surface. And Australia, Canada, Japan and the member nations of the European Space Agency will be pooling their resources with us in the return to the Moon -- a circumstance that will bring the cost of the effort to any one nation within reason.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS won't be a space race so much as a global exodus undertaken by an international community. And peaceful cooperation among nations, as a tangible means to build strong lasting international partnerships and defuse tensions and conflicts in the future, will be a welcome result.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, maybe the pace of progress was predictable. Humans first explored Antarctica in the early 20th century. Decades passed before we had the technology that would allow us to establish a permanent presence. History will indicate the same for our interplanetary forays. Our initial ''small step for a man'' on the Moon took place in 1969. A half-century later, we will be there anew, to live and work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reach that future will require two critical ingredients: adequate financing and a long-term cross-administration commitment that supports steady, uninterrupted progress. Our first reach for the Moon took us from President Kennedy's spoken words to the lunar surface in little over eight years under a budget profile that saw peaks in annual NASA budget of more than $30 billion in current dollars -- a shocking number by today's standards and a good measure of how important we then considered the endeavor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sustained budgets of that magnitude are out of the question today, what is not out of the question is our ability to pay to keep the goal front and center. We are now spending in Iraq, in a single month, $9 billion -- more than half the annual budget NASA needs to stay on course.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-five years ago today, John Glenn Jr. became the first American to venture into orbit around the Earth. Just 9 years old, I knew at that moment that the future would be big and wide, and that I might go places no one had ever been before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There could be no better way today to encourage an equally optimistic belief in the future than to embark on an odyssey that presents tremendous challenges, demands discipline and rigor, requires decades-long focus, inspires international cooperation, promotes lasting peace, improves life for all and paints a stirring vision of an expanded human presence beyond the Earth. There could be no better way to say: the future is boundless, and it belongs to us.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17 -- For nearly 50 years, Bob Morgan and his family have kept a box full of charred debris that they swear fell out of the early morning sky on Dec. 8, 1957.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My dad said it was glowing so bright that you couldn't look at it with your naked eye,'' Mr. Morgan said of the pieces of metal and plastic that came to rest behind his grandfather's house in Encino, Calif. ''So they grabbed some sunglasses until this thing had cooled down.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no one has ever confirmed what the objects were, Mr. Morgan has long believed that he has a piece -- or 13 pieces to be exact -- of one of the most famous objects ever to fly: Sputnik I, the first man-made object to orbit the earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts are skeptical, but Mr. Morgan has found a champion in an unlikely, but strangely connected, source: the Beat Museum, a small storefront collection of books and memorabilia of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and other writers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum, which opened in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco last fall, has made plans to sponsor a spring tour of Mr. Morgan's space scrap in a vintage Airstream trailer, creating a kind of Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test for the astronomy set.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Cimino, the founder of the for-profit museum, said he is mounting the exhibit as both a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Sputnik -- which was launched Oct. 4, 1957, and inspired the name Beatnik -- as well as something of an old-school, Merry Pranksters-style lark.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't call it a stunt, but there's nothing wrong to shouting out your message,'' said Mr. Cimino, 52, a former corporate computer salesman who started the museum in 2003 in Monterey, Calif. ''And if I can use this story to call attention to the message of the Beat Museum, which is tolerance, inclusiveness and having the courage to live your own individual dreams, that's a good thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan says it is not a hoax, and he does have some evidence for his theory, including a 1962 letter from the Air Force referring to the objects as ''the Sputnik parts,'' as well as schematic drawings from a 1950s Russian publication -- ''Technology for Youth'' -- showing a Sputnik with similar-shaped parts to those his family found. Some scientists also say that the pieces -- two hard, clear plastic rings and a series of smaller plastic and metal parts -- could have been part of Sputnik's booster rocket.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official story, according to NASA, is that Sputnik I -- which was about the size of a beach ball, with a radio transmitter and four dramatic tails -- re-entered the atmosphere in the early hours of Jan. 4, 1958, almost a month after Mr. Morgan's space junk landed. Most scientists think Sputnik I burned up before it hit the ground. But its exact demise remains a mystery.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Hargenrader, an archivist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said it is possible that what Mr. Morgan recovered is part of the final stage of the satellite's launching rocket, which was a much larger object, made up of 90 feet of aluminum. The final booster stage stayed in orbit with the Sputnik I and re-entered the atmosphere in early December 1957. News accounts at the time show that Soviet scientists believed that the rocket had re-entered over Alaska or the West Coast of North America.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Roger D. Launius, a space history curator at the National Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian, agreed that it was possible that Mr. Morgan's items were part of the booster but said the claim would face a heavy burden of proof.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to document its history since the point it originated,'' Mr. Launius said. ''If it dates to 1957, where was it found, who found it, and where has it been lo these many years? If you don't get good answers to those questions, there's good reasons to question it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan's grandfather tried to claim a reward for the pieces, giving them to military officials temporarily for inspection. In 1962, an Air Force colonel wrote a letter to the Morgans saying that although the family had ''recovered the Sputnik parts,'' there was no reward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan inherited the parts in the mid-1990s. He found schematic pictures of the original Sputnik and compared them to what he had. ''There's lot of pieces that resemble stuff, and there's a lot of pieces that don't,'' he said. ''But one of the pieces I have has the same screw-holes in the same places.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Hargenrader says that the Russian diagrams Mr. Morgan cites were most likely copies of pictures of American satellites reprinted in Russian magazines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, if the pieces are not Sputnik or its rocket, what are they?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Dickson, a historian and the author of ''Sputnik: The Shock of the Century,'' said the skies around Encino, in the San Fernando Valley, were probably very active in 1957, during the International Geophysical Year, a global effort to study geophysical phenomenon. ''The whole country was enmeshed in experimentation,'' he said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That lesson is nowhere more obvious, experts and friends said, than in the case of Lisa M. Nowak, the Navy captain who was arrested early Monday on charges of attacking a woman in Florida.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police say Captain Nowak considered the woman, Colleen Shipman, an Air Force captain, to be a rival for the affections of another astronaut, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak and her husband of nearly 20 years, Richard, separated some weeks ago, according to a statement this week from her family.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of marital discord in the astronaut corps,'' with the long absences and high pressure, Dr. Jon Clark, a former NASA physician whose wife, Laurel Salton Clark, died in the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Clark, who said the Nowaks were good friends with whom he and his wife had a great deal in common, said that life after a mission could have been very hard for Captain Nowak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're the rock star, you're at the high of your high, you have this great, wonderful, super-elevated moment in space,'' Dr. Clark said. ''You come back and you're cleaning up your kids' mess and cooking.'' What's more, he said, the astronaut returns to a husband who has been doing solo parenting duty and expects to get a break, only to hear, ''Hey, this is your problem now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be wrenching, he said, ''Some of those things can just conspire to nail you.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said that Captain Nowak attacked Captain Shipman with pepper spray in the parking lot of the Orlando airport; Captain Nowak was charged with attempted murder.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said they found such items as a knife, a steel mallet, rubber tubing, latex gloves and garbage bags in Captain Nowak's car, along with e-mail messages between Commander Oefelein and Captain Shipman, and Captain Shipman's travel plans, which Captain Nowak told the police that she had obtained from Commander Oefelein's computer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak had driven more than 900 miles from Texas to Florida to confront Captain Shipman, and the police said she wore adult diapers on the trip so that she would not have to stop to relieve herself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since her arrest, NASA has put her on 30-day leave and removed her from mission activities; she was going to work at mission control during the space shuttle flight in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials announced on Wednesday that the agency was reviewing its screening and psychological evaluation, and would try to determine whether signs of trouble with Captain Nowak had been missed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Captain Nowak and her parents were in her home in the Houston suburbs. It was not clear where her husband and children were.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an official NASA interview on the space agency's Web site from 2005, Captain Nowak, who has twin 5-year-old girls and a teenage son, talked about the way that NASA's intense training means ''a sacrifice for our own personal time and our families and the people around us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the unique aspects of an astronaut's life might draw attention, Lawrence A. Palinkas, an expert in astronaut psychology at the University of Southern California, said space travelers have sources of stress that would be recognized by many people in more earthbound careers -- and a similarly elevated rate of divorce rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any occupation where you have people spending a fair amount of time away from families -- perhaps the best analogy is military deployment -- you're going to have stress related to job demands,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts are not immune to stress, he said, though they are selected for emotional stability and trained to compartmentalize emotional issues and continue to perform on the job.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they intended to find out if they can do more to provide astronauts and their families with the support they need. In a telephone briefing with reporters yesterday, Ellen Ochoa, the director of flight crew operations at the Johnson Space Center, said that in the review of the space agency's psychological counseling services and procedures, ''we're going to be asking ourselves, 'Is there more that we should be doing post flight?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that NASA had no rules regarding relationships between astronauts, beyond general civil service, that govern relationships between bosses and subordinates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with reporters before her July flight, Captain Nowak said that with the space shuttle program winding down, she expected that her first flight could be her last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a good chance I won't fly again,'' she said. ''They don't need me to do another flight,'' because there are many astronauts with similar skills. But when asked if that was cause for regret, she quickly said, ''Of course it was worth doing it.''  </p>

Lisa M. Nowak, the astronaut accused of attempted murder, space agency officials said yesterday. It will also try to determine whether ''indications of concern'' in Captain Nowak's case were overlooked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said, however, that her behavior had raised no obvious concerns recently and that she had been at work last week preparing for her job at mission control for the next shuttle flight, in March.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, of the Navy, flew back from Orlando, Fla., to Houston yesterday morning. She covered her head with a jacket as she got off a commercial airliner, and was taken to the Johnson Space Center, where she was given medical tests, a space agency spokesman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sad homecoming capped a tumultuous few days in which Captain Nowak drove more than 900 miles from Texas to Florida to confront an Air Force captain, Colleen Shipman, who she believed to be a rival for the affections of another astronaut. The police say Captain Nowak sprayed Captain Shipman with pepper spray at Orlando International Airport early Monday morning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, who wore diapers on the drive so she would not have to stop to relieve herself, took along a disguise, a compressed air pistol, a steel mallet, a knife, latex gloves and garbage bags, the police said. She was charged on Tuesday with attempted murder and released on bail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have said that this appears to be the first time that an active duty astronaut has been charged with a felony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Captain Shipman filed a request for a protective order against Captain Nowak. In that document, she stated that Captain Nowak had been stalking her for about two months and referred to the astronaut who officials say was the focus of Captain Nowak's jealousy, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy, as her ''boyfriend.'' She also said that she had not met Captain Nowak until the attack.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials said Captain Nowak's parents had gone to Houston from Rockville, Md., to help her, and that her husband was taking care of their children. The couple separated recently, the family has said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference in Washington, NASA officials described the events after Captain Nowak's arrest. Captain Shipman informed Commander Oefelein, who was on leave in Florida, of the attack. He contacted Ellen Ochoa, the director of flight crew operations early Monday. The director of the Johnson Space Center, Michael Coats, then dispatched Col. Steven W. Lindsey to Florida to ''offer any appropriate assistance.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrest set the agency's review process in motion, said Shana Dale, NASA's deputy administrator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday morning, NASA's administrator, Michael Griffin, ordered Mr. Coats to conduct the review of the space agency's initial psychological screening and ''ongoing psychological assessments during an astronaut's career,'' Ms. Dale said. Yesterday, he ordered a broader inquiry run from Washington that would use outside experts as well, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-level review process is intended to find out if astronauts are getting the ''level of psychological and medical care and attention they need,'' Ms. Dale said. Despite the review, she added, ''we think we're doing things very, very well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the case should have no long-term impact on the space agency's reputation, calling it ''a unique situation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency officials insisted that asking for help with emotional problems did not hurt an astronaut's chance of flying, but Dr. Jon Clark, a former NASA physician whose wife, Laurel Salton Clark, died in the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, said in an interview, ''What people say and what's reality are two different things.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Astronauts know there is a stigma attached to this stuff,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The psychological services are delivered only on demand, he said, which is a problem for self-reliant astronauts. ''They won't come to you and say, 'I've got a problem,' '' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak has been relieved of her duties and will not be involved in the shuttle mission scheduled to begin as early as March 15. She was going to be ''capsule communicator,'' or Capcom, relaying information to the astronauts aboard the shuttle from mission control. Substituting another astronaut into the position for the coming mission is relatively straightforward, said Col. Robert D. Cabana, the deputy director of the Johnson Space Center, speaking at the news conference from Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, the Johnson Space Center locked down for what could be a long media siege. The news media swarmed in the neighborhoods where NASA workers live, and helicopters from television stations flew overhead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA astronaut family support office sent an e-mail message to the spouses of astronauts saying that ''several astronaut families have been surprised by media representatives at their homes, and wished they had not opened their doors.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Use your own discretion if contacted by the press,'' the message read. ''However, check the credentials of anyone who contacts you to avoid a situation that could be awkward or even dangerous.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the space agency had no rules governing fraternization and infidelity among astronauts corresponding to such rules in the military. Ms. Dale said that NASA simply expects astronauts to conduct themselves in ways that will reflect well on the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Navy said that it is too early to even start considering whether the Navy will conduct its own investigation or press its own charges against Captain Nowak. Any procedure would come after the case has worked its way through civilian courts, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Houston, Colonel Cabana said that people at the Johnson Space Center are trying to cope with their surprise and sadness at the bizarre chain of events, but are also working to retain their focus on the continuing support of the International Space Station and the coming shuttle mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked his impression of Captain Nowak, Colonel Cabana said she ''was a vibrant, hard-working'' -- and then stopped himself briefly and started again, saying, ''is a vibrant, hardworking, energetic person who did her job very well.''  </p>

Lisa Nowak is not just a tragedy for the astronaut and her family. It strikes at the cherished image of astronauts as superior individuals who can cope with stresses that might crumple the rest of us. However the criminal charges are ultimately resolved, there is already a clear lesson of this bizarre case: astronauts are human, subject to the same marital strains and mental aberrations that afflict more ordinary mortals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency may need to revise its procedures for screening the psychological health of astronauts -- particularly those who might embark on long space trips. The agency is taking precisely the right action in beginning reviews of its screening procedures, from the time of application into the retirement years.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently astronauts undergo a rigorous psychological and psychiatric screening to gain admission to the corps. But there are no formal psychological evaluations during their years of service thereafter, unless a medical doctor senses the need for one or an astronaut is scheduled for an extended flight on the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no evidence so far that any psychological problems interfered with Captain Nowak's well-regarded performance on her first and only shuttle flight last July. But it is unnerving that only seven months later, she drove more than 900 miles to confront a woman she deemed a rival for the affections of another astronaut. As the police described it, she wore a diaper to avoid stopping for rest breaks, carried an array of weapons, wore a wig and shot pepper spray into her rival's face.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident makes one suspect that NASA needs to provide more support for astronauts than the usual employee counseling programs. Captain Nowak's drama played out in an airport parking lot. Imagine a comparable scene at a base on the Moon or on a spaceship to Mars.   </p>

In Orlando, they say, she confronted her rival in a parking lot, attacking her with pepper spray.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak was in disguise at the time, wearing a wig, the police said. She had with her a compressed air pistol, a steel mallet, a knife, pepper spray, four feet of rubber tubing, latex gloves and garbage bags.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who know her say they are mystified. ''I was in shock,'' said Dennis Alloy, 43, of Tysons Corner, Va., a friend and high school classmate. ''When I knew her, I couldn't imagine an evil bone in her body.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many inside and outside the space agency are wondering how the problems of Captain Nowak, who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1985 and served in the Navy before joining National Aeronautics and Space Administration, were not detected before this. Many are also wondering whether the ''Right Stuff'' image of astronauts has been tarnished, or if that image somehow confused technical excellence with emotional stability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like any other people, they're human,'' said George Abbey, director of the Johnson Space Center when Commander Nowak was selected for the astronaut corps, who recalled her as ''an outstanding candidate.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak, 43, was arrested at 4 a.m. Monday at Orlando International Airport, the police said, after attacking the other woman, Capt. Colleen Shipman of the Air Force.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the police report, by Detective William C. Becton, Captain Nowak said that she had not intended to harm Captain Shipman and that she believed that ''this was the only time she was going to be able to speak'' with her. The compressed air pistol she carried ''was going to be used to entice Ms. Shipman to talk with her,'' according to the report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detective Becton wrote, ''When I asked Mrs. Nowak if she thought the pepper spray was going to help her speak with Ms. Shipman, she replied, 'That was stupid.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the police report, Captain Nowak said she saw Captain Shipman, 30, as a rival for the affection of Cmdr. William A. Oefelein, a fellow astronaut. She told the police that she and Commander Oefelein, whose NASA nickname is Billy-O, had ''more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship.'' Commander Oefelein, 41, is divorced and has two children.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday was a day of confusion and quickly shifting events. Captain Nowak, a married mother of three, was brought before a judge for arraignment at 8:30 a.m. Two of her fellow astronauts -- the chief of NASA's astronaut office, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, and Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy -- were there to offer support.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judge had agreed to release Captain Nowak on $15,000 bond on charges of kidnapping and battery, but the police added a charge of attempted murder, and bail was increased to $25,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Shipman is seeking a protective order against Captain Nowak, according to documents posted on the Web site of The Orlando Sentinel, which broke the story Monday night.In Orlando at the end of the day, Captain Nowak posted bail and later in the evening was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet so her movements could be monitored after her return to Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's is going home,'' said her lawyer , Donald Lykkebak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak and her husband, Richard, a flight controller for the International Space Station, live with their children in a two-story brick-and-glass home in Houston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few neighbors there wanted to talk about the case, but one, who asked that his name not be used, said the couple had an argument in November with raised voices and the sound of breaking china.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one was home on Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement from the family last night on the Sentinel Web site said that the Nowaks had been married for 19 years but that Captain Nowak and her husband ''had separated a few weeks ago.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, Michael Coats, the director of the Johnson Space Center, said in a statement: ''We are deeply saddened by this tragic event. The charges against Lisa Nowak are serious ones that must be decided by the judicial system.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Coats said Captain Nowak was ''officially on 30-day leave and has been removed from flight status and all mission-related activities.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could a person involved in such a case rise within the space agency, which is famous for its psychological screening of astronaut candidates?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Kanas, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied astronaut psychology, said that the screening occurs only at the very beginning of the process and that once an astronaut has gotten through the front door, the formal psychological evaluations give way to evaluation of job performance. Psychological counseling is available but not mandatory, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can screen out very serious stuff, but we can't always predict the future,'' Professor Kanas said, and ''people change over time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak first came to the space program in April 1996 and finally flew aboard the space shuttle in July 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 13-day flight of the shuttle Discovery, which was launched on July 4 of last year, she operated the robot arm during spacewalks with her crewmate Stephanie D. Wilson, earning them the shared nickname Robo Chicks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an astronaut she performed roles including capcom, the astronaut who communicates with orbiting space station crews.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Kanas said that most astronauts went through the experience of finally reaching space and came out well but that ''for some it's very difficult to adjust'' to seeing the abrupt end of something they have worked so hard to achieve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people are extremely well-suited, by personality and training, to deal with the stresses of being in space,'' Professor Kanas said. But, he added, ''that doesn't mean that they're not vulnerable to emotional problems, or problems in their relationships.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's astronauts find themselves in a world much less glamorous than the original crews. While the Mercury Seven raced Corvettes, today's family-oriented fliers are likelier to tool around in minivans. They spend much more time in suburbia than in orbit, and there are no more ticker-tape parades for the returning heroes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some former officials of the space program said that romantic thoughts and even love triangles were not unknown to the program but that it was up to management to watch carefully and intervene.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abbey, the former Johnson Space Center director, said, ''You've got some hard-charging people, and you need to manage them.'' Problems like this ''don't happen overnight,'' and so ''you have to be sensitive to what your people are doing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now and then on his watch, he recalled, ''I stepped in, and people weren't happy about it,'' he recalled, but it was important to tell them that ''whatyou're doing is not a personal thing for you -- it's affecting a lot of people around you, and affecting your performance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Kraft, NASA's original flight director, said he was surprised. If someone was slipping toward such trouble, Mr. Kraft said, ''your fellow crew members would pick that up.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Nowak's use of a diaper on the long drive to Florida is no mystery to astronauts. Mike Mullane, a retired astronaut, said many astronauts wear a device -- ''we call them urine collection devices'' -- during launching, landing and spacewalks, ''when you're in a pressure suit and cannot get to a toilet.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other mysteries in the case could be more persistent. Michael Stone, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, said he was struck by the thoroughness of Captain Nowak's preparation, which he said was generally ''a guy thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's extraordinarily rare for a woman to do this type of a crime,'' Professor Stone said. He said the more customary response was to try to kill the object of affection, as Jean Harris shot Herman Tarnower in 1980. ''This is really close to unique in the annals of female crime,'' he said.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, space experts have worried that a speeding bit of orbital debris might one day smash a large spacecraft into hundreds of pieces and start a chain reaction, a slow cascade of collisions that would expand for centuries, spreading chaos through the heavens. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade or so, as scientists came to agree that the number of objects in orbit had surpassed a critical mass -- or, in their terms, the critical spatial density, the point at which a chain reaction becomes inevitable -- they grew more anxious. </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this year, after a half-century of growth, the federal list of detectable objects (four inches wide or larger) reached 10,000, including dead satellites, spent rocket stages, a camera, a hand tool and junkyards of whirling debris left over from chance explosions and destructive tests. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, experts say, China's test on Jan. 11 of an antisatellite rocket that shattered an old satellite into hundreds of large fragments means the chain reaction will most likely start sooner. If their predictions are right, the cascade could put billions of dollars' worth of advanced satellites at risk and eventually threaten to limit humanity's reach for the stars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal and private experts say that early estimates of 800 pieces of detectable debris from the shattering of the satellite will grow to nearly 1,000 as observations continue by tracking radars and space cameras. At either number, it is the worst such episode in space history. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, next year or next decade, some piece of whirling debris will start the cascade, experts say. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's inevitable,'' said Nicholas L. Johnson, chief scientist for orbital debris at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''A significant piece of debris will run into an old rocket body, and that will create more debris. It's a bad situation.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey E. Forden, an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is analyzing the Chinese satellite debris, said China perhaps failed to realize the magnitude of the test's indirect hazards. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Forden suggested that Chinese engineers might have understood the risks but failed to communicate them. In China, he said, ''the decision process is still so opaque that maybe they didn't know who to talk to. Maybe you have a disconnect between the engineers and the people who think about policy.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, experts note, has 39 satellites of its own -- many of them now facing a heightened risk of destruction. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politically, the situation is delicate. In recent years China has played a growing international role in fighting the proliferation of space junk. In 2002, for instance, it joined with other spacefaring nations to suggest voluntary guidelines for debris control. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Beijing is to play host to the annual meeting of the advocacy group, known as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee. Donald J. Kessler, a former head of the orbital debris program at NASA and a pioneer analyst of the space threat, said Chinese officials at the forum would probably feel ''some embarrassment.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kessler said Western analysts agreed that China's new satellite fragments would speed the chain reaction's onset. ''If the Chinese didn't do the test, it would still happen,'' he said. ''It just wouldn't happen as quickly.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week in Beijing, a foreign ministry spokeswoman failed to respond directly to a debris question. Asked if the satellite's remains would threaten other spacecraft, she asserted that China's policy was to keep space free of weapons. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are ready to strengthen international cooperation in this regard,'' the spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, told reporters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cascade warnings began as early as 1978. Mr. Kessler and his NASA colleague, Burton G. Cour-Palais, wrote in The Journal of Geophysical Research that speeding junk that formed more junk would produce ''an exponential increase in the number of objects with time, creating a belt of debris around the Earth.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the cold war, Moscow and Washington generally ignored the danger and, from 1968 to 1986, conducted more than 20 tests of antisatellite arms that created clouds of jagged scraps. Often, they did so at low altitudes from which the resulting debris soon plunged earthward. Still, the number of objects grew as more nations launched rockets and satellites into orbit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, as the count passed 8,000, the National Academy of Sciences warned in a thick report that some crowded orbits appeared to have already reached the ''critical density'' needed to sustain a chain reaction. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, apprehension rose as the fuel tank of an abandoned American rocket engine exploded, breaking the craft into 713 detectable fragments -- until now, the record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid such developments, space experts identified the first collisions that threatened to start a chain reaction, putting analysts increasingly on edge. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 17, 2005, for instance, a piece of speeding debris from an exploded Chinese rocket collided with a derelict American rocket body that had been shot into space 31 years earlier. Warily, investigators searched though orbital neighborhoods but found to their relief that the crackup had produced only four pieces of detectable debris. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, Mr. Johnson, the chief scientist for NASA's orbital debris program, and his colleague J. -C. Liou, published an article in the journal Science that detailed the growing threat. They said orbits were now so cluttered that the chain reaction was sure to start even if spacefaring nations refrained from launching any more spacecraft. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The environment is unstable,'' they wrote, ''and collisions will become the most dominant debris-generating mechanism.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in this atmosphere of rising tension that China last month fired a rocket into space that shattered an old weather satellite -- its first successful test of an antisatellite weapon. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., calculated that the old satellite had broken into 1,000 fragments four inches wide or larger, and millions of smaller ones. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal sky-watchers who catalogue objects in the Earth orbit work slowly and deliberately. As of yesterday, they publicly listed 647 detectable pieces of the satellite but were said to be tracking hundreds more. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakup was dangerous because the satellite's orbit was relatively high, some 530 miles up. That means the debris will remain in space for tens, thousands or even millions of years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kessler, the former NASA official, now a private consultant in Asheville, N.C., said China might have chosen a relatively high target to avoid directly threatening the International Space Station and its astronaut crew, which orbit at a height of about 220 miles. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe the choice was to endanger the station in the short term or to cause a long-term problem,'' he said. ''Maybe that forced them to raise the orbit.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the paths of the speeding Chinese debris, following the laws of physics and of celestial mechanics, expanded in many directions, including upward and downward. As of last week, outliers from the central cloud stretched from roughly 100 miles to more than 2,000 miles above the Earth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solution to the cascade threat exists but is costly. In his Science paper and in recent interviews, Mr. Johnson of NASA argued that the only sure answer was environmental remediation, including the removal of existing large objects from orbit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robots might install rocket engines to send dead spacecraft careering back into the atmosphere, or ground-based lasers might be used to zap debris. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news, Mr. Johnson said in his paper, is that ''for the near term, no single remediation technique appears to be both technically feasible and economically viable.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing is done, a kind of orbital crisis might ensue that is known as the Kessler Syndrome, after Mr. Kessler. A staple of science fiction, it holds that the space around Earth becomes so riddled with junk that launchings are almost impossible. Vehicles that entered space would quickly be destroyed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Kessler called the worst-case scenario an exaggeration. ''It's been overdone,'' he said of the syndrome. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he warned of an economic barrier to space exploration that could arise. To fight debris, he said, designers will have to give spacecraft more and more shielding, struggling to protect the craft from destruction and making them heavier and more costly in the process. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, he said, perhaps centuries from now, the costs will outweigh the benefits. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gets more and more expensive,'' he said. ''Sooner or later it gets too expensive to do business in space.'' </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Working gingerly in a cramped area outside the International Space Station, two spacewalking astronauts successfully switched half the outpost's coolant lines on Wednesday into a permanent cooling system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk was the first of three scheduled over nine days, an unusually short time for ventures outside the station by its crew. The trip outside the station officially ended at 6:09 p.m. Eastern time, lasting 7 hours 55 minutes. The astronauts exceeded a planned time of six and one-half hours as they labored to switch electrical and fluid lines from interim to permanent locations on the station's girderlike supporting truss.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers, Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria and Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, both of the Navy, took extra time moving four fluid lines carrying toxic ammonia coolant to avoid being contaminated with the material, as occurred in a 2001 spacewalk. On that mission, the astronaut Robert L. Curbeam Jr. had to brush flakes of frozen ammonia from his suit and spend extra time outside so sunlight could evaporate the rest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Removing thermal covers over the connections, the astronauts carefully relocated the fluid lines and tested the new attachments for a sure fit before replacing the insulating covers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Williams, a flight engineer, said she saw no evidence of an ammonia leak, but Captain Lopez-Alegria, the station commander, said he noticed a large flake floating away at one point that might have been ammonia or a paint chip. Mission planners do not want astronauts to take ammonia back into the station, where it would evaporate and contaminate the air.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts are to perform a nearly identical spacewalk on Sunday to complete the cooling system switch, and on Feb. 8 they will remove some thermal blankets from part of the truss and set up two external platforms for stowing cargo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fourth, but unrelated, spacewalk is scheduled for Feb. 22, when Captain Lopez-Alegria and Mikhail Tyurin, a flight engineer, will venture outside to free a stuck antenna on a Progress cargo craft docked to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is common for astronauts to have closely timed spacewalks when a space shuttle is visiting the station and the shuttle crew does the outside work. During the last shuttle mission, in December, for example, the Discovery's crew performed four ventures outside to rewire the station and retract a solar panel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But spacewalks for a three-member station crew are rare because of astronauts' additional duties of maintaining the outpost during long stays and having fewer people available to help with the outside work.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble Space Telescope is flying partly blind across the heavens, a result of a short circuit on Saturday morning in its most popular instrument, the Advanced Camera for Surveys.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers reported yesterday that most of the camera's capabilities, including the ability to take the sort of deep cosmic postcards that have inspired the public and to track the mysterious dark energy splitting the universe to the ends of time, had probably been lost for good.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone news conference, Hubble engineers and scientists said the telescope itself was in fine shape and would continue operating with its remaining instruments, which include another camera, the wide-field planetary camera 2, or wfpc2, and an infrared camera and spectrograph named Nicmos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, we are very disappointed,'' Preston Burch, program manager for the telescope, said at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., noting that the camera had basically met its five-year design lifetime. The Hubble telescope, Mr. Burch said, still has significant science capability.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burch and his colleagues said it was unlikely that they would be able to repair the camera during the next Hubble servicing mission, which is scheduled for September 2008. On that mission, astronauts will replace the wide-field camera with a powerful new version, wfpc3, which will extend the telescope's vision to ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths and restore the lost capabilities. They will also install a new ultraviolet spectrograph and make many other pressing repairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that the five days of spacewalks for that mission were already full, and that changing things to fix the camera would cost time and money, Dr. Burch said, ''At first blush, this doesn't look attractive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Advanced Camera for Surveys was installed on the telescope in March 2002, and it has been the space telescope's workhorse. Among its feats, in 2003 the camera took the deepest photograph of the cosmos ever taken, the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, showing young galaxy fragments only one billion to two billion years after the Big Bang. In the most recent round of proposals from astronomers to use the telescope, about two-thirds required the advanced camera.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The camera had been operating on its backup electrical system since last summer, however, when electrical problems in its main system caused it to shut down for a while. Now the backup system has failed, dooming its ability to take wide-field or high-resolution images.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The camera may yet be operated in what the engineers called ''solar blind mode,'' at ultraviolet wavelengths to observe phenomena like auroras on Jupiter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electrical problems apparently did not spread to the rest of the telescope. Rick Howard, of NASA headquarters, said: ''The fuse did what it was supposed to do. It saw a high current, and it popped. It protected the rest of the telescope.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said that the Space Telescope Science Institute had developed a contingency plan of observations that could go on without the camera and that there was no shortage of astronomers who would want to use it. Some of the telescope's most crucial and high-visibility programs, however, will be delayed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Riess of the space telescope institute, who has used the Hubble telescope to search for supernova explosions in the distant universe to gauge the effects of dark energy on cosmic history, said these explosions would now be out of reach until the new camera was installed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Dr. Riess said in an e-mail message, it was a great camera. ''Although it only lasted 4.9 years, it was only rated for 5 years,'' he said, ''so we really got our money's worth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Aging in Space''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space telescope's primary camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys, one of five instruments on board, shut down over the weekend. It is unlikely that the camera will be fixed in a planned repair mission in 2008.  </p>

The orbiter's high-resolution camera was able to spot not only where the Opportunity rover is exploring, but even its tracks in the sand. Elsewhere, the sharper-than-ever images have revealed large boulders in areas that previously looked smooth, which led NASA to reconsider the landing site for its Phoenix mission, scheduled to set down in 2008.  </p>

The reddish area is dust-colored ice at the top of the canyon.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perservering on the Ground  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed to last just three months on Mars, but both of them passed their third anniversaries this month. The two rovers are aging. The right front wheel on Spirit no longer turns, for example, and one of Opportunity's turning motors has failed. But Spirit continues to drive on its other five wheels, and Opportunity just makes wider turns. While Spirit hunkered down through most of winter -- the season is now turning to spring -- Opportunity drove five miles to reach Victoria Crater. Below left is Opportunity's view of Cape St. Mary, one of the promontories that jut into the half-mile-wide crater as other parts of the crater edge erode. What the scientists see so far at Victoria Crater fits with their notion that this region of Mars was once wet. Like other craters in Meridiani Planum, the plains that Opportunity landed on, the rocks appear to have formed from sediments that were pushed by flowing water, dried out and then blown around by wind. What the scientists have not seen yet: finer sediments that settle out on a lake bottom. ''What we would love to find is evidence for a standing body of water,'' said John Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the rover science team.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's associate administrator for exploration, Scott Horowitz, said that the design of the rocket, the Ares I, was progressing well and that the rocket should be ready for its first test flight on schedule in 2009.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz acknowledged that the design had had an increase in weight, a subject of speculation in the aerospace industry, but said that was not unexpected in the early stages of rocket development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said the rocket, derived from the solid-rocket boosters that lift the shuttles at the starts of their flights, was well within performance limits to lift the 25-ton Orion crew exploration vehicle into orbit. The Orion is to carry crews of six to the space station starting in 2014 and also serve as a crew vehicle for later flights to the Moon under President Bush's expanded exploration plans for NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ares I has more than sufficient performance,'' he told reporters at a briefing in NASA headquarters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned lifting capacity of a rocket includes not only the basic maximum payload but also a reserve for contingencies. The preliminary designs now indicate that the rocket can lift its 50,000-pound primary payload, the Orion capsule, but that excess weight is eating into an 8,000-pound-to-10,000-pound reserve, Mr. Horowitz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the design progresses and is refined, he added, the expected weight savings should allow the recovery of most of the reserve. The two-stage Ares I will stand taller than 300 feet and use a more powerful version of a space shuttle booster as the first stage. The shuttle booster uses four segments of solid rocket fuel. The Ares I is to use five.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second stage is to be powered by a liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen updated version of the J-2 engine that propelled upper stages of the Saturn V rocket that sent men to the Moon more than 30 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current plans call for a test flight of Ares I with a dummy second stage in April 2009, with the first full scale test of the entire rocket in 2012.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quintet of identical satellites, NASA's first attempt to launch so many satellites on a single rocket, will be positioned in orbits inside the magnetic field surrounding Earth to look for the origin of sudden energy outbursts that enliven the northern and southern lights.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space probes are part of a mission called Themis, short for Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms, which is designed to find the trigger point of geomagnetic substorms that can spring up within minutes to brighten auroras and release bursts of potentially damaging radiation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sun constantly fills space with charged particles and other radiation through solar flares or large eruptions called coronal mass ejections. The Earth's magnetic field shields the planet from most of this solar wind by capturing these high-energy particles and channeling them around the planet, forming a tear-shaped protective bubble called the magnetosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these particles leak through the magnetosphere and pour through the atmosphere toward the poles, colliding with air molecules and causing the atmosphere to glow in a greenish-white light. From space, these auroras glow like oval haloes encircling the north and south magnetic poles. At times, however, energy builds up within the magnetic field until it suddenly breaks loose into what is called a substorm, releasing a burst of electrical current that turns the auroras into pulsing red, purple and white colors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and Swales Aerospace of Beltsville, Md., the satellites aim to establish once and for all where in the magnetosphere substorms originate and what triggers them, said Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos, a research physicist at the university and the chief scientist for the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For over 30 years, the source location of these explosive energy releases has been sought after with great fervor,'' Dr. Angelopoulos said. ''A substorm starts from a single point in space and progresses past the Moon's orbit within minutes, so a single satellite cannot identify the substorm origin.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Substorms are a recurring phenomenon that can pop up at any time, even during periods of low solar activity, he said. They appear as well during major storms caused by regular solar eruptions, adding to their destructive power, and a series of substorms happening by themselves can produce enough accumulated energy to cause damage, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar storms can damage or disrupt communications and GPS navigation satellites, overload and knock out electric power grids, and pose a radiation danger to astronauts in space, experts said. ''Themis is a stepping stone to explain space weather phenomenon that affects our lives,'' Dr. Angelopoulos said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Harvey, project manager for the mission at the university, said the five-satellite constellation is scheduled to be launched aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Feb. 15. Observations from four of the satellites are needed to complete the $200 million mission, and the fifth spacecraft will serve as an in-orbit spare.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dishwasher-sized satellites are to coast in Earth orbit for 10 months until they line up within Earth's shadow like a string of beads, with two of the spacecraft positioned about one-sixth of the way to the Moon and the other two about halfway. By February 2008, they will begin collecting coordinated measurements every four days to pinpoint where and when substorms begin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get an added dimension to the life cycles of these substorms, the satellite measurements will be coordinated with ground-based readings from 20 observatories spread over Alaska and Canada. These northern observatories are equipped with all-sky cameras and magnetometer sensors that measure currents in near-Earth space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Angelopoulos said he expected the satellites to observe more than 30 substorms during the mission's lifespan and make a major contribution to understanding space physics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Themis is so important because the same fundamental physical process is seen around all planets, it happens on the Sun in solar flares, and in astrophysical systems such as black holes,'' he said. ''It's amazing that being so close to us, here at Earth, it is not understood yet.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worthy as that goal may be, a couple of scientists wondered if this giant instrument, inelegantly known as the Low-Frequency Demonstrator of the Mileura Wide-Field Array, could also act as rabbit ears to tune in to something like ''I Love Lucy'' from a not-too-distant alien civilization.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, almost all searches for extraterrestrial civilizations have listened for deliberate radio beacons from beings reaching out for someone else.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mileura Wide-Field Array is designed to hear the sounds of ''reionization,'' when ultraviolet radiation from the first quasars and galaxies blew apart interstellar hydrogen atoms. But, to the frustration of cosmologists, those electromagnetic signals would be roughly the same wavelengths as television and radio broadcasts.

The lakes are more intriguing evidence of the active phenomena at play on the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery, reported yesterday by an international team of researchers, was made by a radar survey of Titan's high northern latitudes by the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn and its retinue of satellites since July 2004. One of the mission's major objectives is the investigation of Titan's environment, thought to be a frigid version of conditions on the primordial Earth.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radar imaging system detected more than 75 dark patches in the landscape near Titan's northern polar region, the scientists said in a detailed description of the find published today in the journal Nature.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patches, they said, indicated smooth surfaces in an otherwise rugged topography, suggesting lake beds either partly dry or filled with liquid. These smooth surfaces, more or less circular and with diameters ranging from 2 miles to 40 miles, are associated with channels that appear to have been formed by flowing liquids, presumably tributaries to the lakes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methane exists in Titan's atmosphere and, in the extreme cold of high latitudes, is expected to rain on the surface and be present as liquids in subsurface reservoirs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radar images, made on a close pass of Saturn's largest moon by the Cassini spacecraft in July, ''provide definitive evidence for the presence of lakes on the surface of Titan,'' the discovery team concluded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the spacecraft conducted its first radar search above 70 degrees north latitude, Ellen R. Stofan, leader of the team, said in an interview, ''We saw a huge swath of the surface just covered with lakes, like Minnesota.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stofan is a planetary scientist at Proxemy Research, a contractor in Virginia to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and also at University College London. Other team members include researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which directs the Cassini mission; the University of Arizona; and several European institutions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an accompanying article in the journal, Christophe Sotin, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was not involved in the research, wrote that the lakes and other mission findings were strong evidence that ''methane on Titan plays the role of water on Earth.'' It is the second-most abundant component of Titan's atmosphere, after nitrogen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery, Dr. Sotin concluded, adds to the ''weight of evidence'' that processes on and beneath Titan's surface must be similar to those dominating the early evolution of any Earth-like planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that displays more dynamism than Titan,'' he wrote. ''Its name is Earth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding large bodies of liquid methane and probably ethane on Titan, in lakes or perhaps vast seas, had long been hypothesized, based on telescope observations of that moon's smoggy methane-rich atmosphere and by the two Voyager spacecraft that passed close some 30 years ago. But the Cassini remote-sensing instruments had failed to detect an ocean, though they and the European Space Agency's Huygens lander did find traces of the channels where liquids had apparently flowed across the surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Cassini's previous encounters with Titan, the smog-penetrating radar found no smaller liquid bodies, until it observed the region from 70 degrees north latitude to 83 degrees north latitude. At present, it is winter in Titan's north. Methane is one of the few molecules to exist as a liquid in such cold conditions, scientists said, and is the most plausible explanation for the smooth, dark surfaces in the radar images.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stofan said that the lake depressions could be volcanic craters or sinkholes; very few craters gouged out by meteorite impacts have been detected on Titan. Their roughly circular shapes and steep-sided rims are typical of volcanic depressions. Surface collapses, as in sinkholes, could fill the lakes with liquids from interior chambers, like aquifers on Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both cases, scientists said, methane vapor condensing and raining out of the cold Titan sky was probably a significant source of the liquid in the lakes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan I. Lunine of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team, described in an interview what the lakes probably look like. The methane liquid would be transparent, enough to see the dark hydrocarbon sediments on the floor of shallow lakes. The liquid would be less viscous than water, perhaps like gasoline. Overhead, aerosols, minute particles in the upper atmosphere, presumably cast a dim orange light on the lake. In the dark of winter, one would need a flashlight to walk the shore.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers invented the concept of a ''dwarf planet'' during a week of rambunctious debate in August to resolve the question of what to call Pluto, until then the ninth and normally outermost planet from the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers have long argued that Pluto, which is only one-500th the mass of the Earth and has an elongated, tilted orbit that sometimes takes it inside Neptune's, is too small and eccentric to be a good match with the other planets. Pluto, they contend, more closely resembles the cosmic riffraff inhabiting the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut of icy debris in the outer solar system.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers' hands were forced in 2005 when the Caltech astronomer Michael Brown discovered an object out in the Kuiper Belt that was bigger than Pluto. This discovery created the prospect of having to admit that object -- then called Xena and now named Eris for the goddess of discord -- and perhaps dozens of others into the club of planets. In response, members of the International Astronomical Union, meeting in Prague, voted to redefine the word ''planet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the new definition, a planet is round, orbits the Sun and has cleared its orbit of competing bodies. There are now eight of those in the solar system. Dwarf planets are round, and orbit the Sun, but have not cleared their zone. Presently there are three of those; Pluto, the asteroid Ceres and the newly christened Eris, but there will most likely be many more as Dr. Brown and others find more Kuiper Belt objects that qualify. Odd fragments and planetary moons, as well as everything else, are now ''small solar system bodies.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers also declared, as a consolation prize, that Pluto was the prototype of a new class of ''trans-Neptunian'' objects, but failed to give them a name.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardly anybody is happy about this solution. Owen Gingerich, the Harvard astronomer and historian who was chairman of the redefinition committee, was among many who said that it violated the rules of English to say that a dwarf planet was not a planet, as the rules now do. In an editorial, Sky and Telescope magazine dissented and said it would continue to list Pluto on its charts as a planet and use the term ''dwarf planet'' only in quotes. DENNIS OVERBYE  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wheels stop,'' said the shuttle commander, Mark L. Polansky, as the Discovery rolled to a stop on the 15,000-foot runway. After returning a greeting from mission managers, he said, ''It's going to be a great holiday.'' </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the day -- which concluded a 13-day mission to rewire the International Space Station -- the astronauts were not sure where they were headed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers at mission control, at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, wrestled for days with the choice of a landing site. The weather rules are strict. There cannot be rain within 30 nautical miles of the runway, because of the risk of lightning and the damage that rain can cause to the shuttle's delicate thermal tiles at high speeds. Visibility has to be good so the commander and the pilot can see the runway, and winds must be at safe levels. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The favorite landing place is the Kennedy Space Center, where the shuttle fleet is maintained and readied for new missions. But clouds and rain at the runway violated NASA's rules for a safe landing at the first opportunity to prepare for a landing around 2 p.m., so managers had to take a close look at the two backup landing strips. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first, at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of California, has been the runway of choice for 50 of the 117 previous shuttle flights. It requires the shuttle to be brought back to Florida atop a specially fitted Boeing 747, which can add weeks to the turnaround time for its next mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final site, at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, has been used only once, in 1982. With little equipment on the site for maintaining the shuttle after it lands and preparing it for transport back to Florida, it was a distant third choice. It would have taken six weeks or more before the Discovery could have returned to Florida had it landed at White Sands. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High winds across the runway at Edwards took it out of the running for the first opportunity to order a landing there, around 4 p.m. Eastern time, and managers took another look at Florida, where weather conditions were improving somewhat. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4:20, mission managers gave the order to prepare for a landing at the Kennedy Space Center with a ''de-orbit burn,'' in which the shuttle fires its rockets to tip it out of orbit and back into the atmosphere. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Ham, an astronaut at mission control communicating with the shuttle crew, called up to say: ''Believe it or not, we're going to offer you a 'go' for the de-orbit burn. We're pretty confident we're going to keep you clear of clouds and rain.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission commanders had already told the astronauts to begin ''fluid loading,'' in which they would drink up to 32 ounces to replenish fluid lost from their body when they entered space. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery followed a re-entry path from the west-southwest, cutting across Mexico and West Texas and passing north of Houston and along the curve of the Gulf Coast. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was complex and ambitious. Spacewalking astronauts rewired the International Space Station so it could draw power from a new array of solar panels that was brought up on the previous mission of the shuttle Atlantis. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rewiring changed the main source of power for the orbiting laboratory, from a temporary configuration that used an old array atop the station; the new power network will allow the addition of more arrays, and the repositioning of the old array so the station will have the power it needs to support modules to be added in the next few years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission's first spacewalk involved adding a short truss to the station's structure. The rewiring required two spacewalks, in which half of the station's power was turned off. Both went smoothly. But things were not as simple in an effort to retract half of the old solar array. It had to be folded back into its container to make way for the new array, which rotates to face the Sun. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the array proved balky after six years of being extended and exposed to the harsh temperature extremes of space. The first effort to retract it by remote control got the panels folded up only about halfway. So mission managers ordered a fourth spacewalk, and two astronauts -- Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy and Christer Fuglesang of the European Space Agency -- poked, prodded and shook the arrays to help the process along. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That set a record for Captain Curbeam, who became the first American to take part in four spacewalks on a single mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission also delivered a new astronaut for the space station's three-member crew. Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy succeeded Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency, who rode back on the Discovery; she is to spend six months at the station. </p>

Curbeam Jr. of the Navy and Christer Fuglesang, a Swede from the European Space Agency, helped a set of arrays, which when fully extended stretched about 115 feet, fold themselves like pleated blinds and fit back into the ''blanket boxes'' in which they made the trip to space.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk began shortly after 2 p.m. Eastern time. The folding operation required the astronauts to move panels painstakingly along a frayed guide wire, to free up stuck grommets, pry panels apart and tug wires into the proper position and, occasionally, to grab the array structure and give it a good shake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was careful craftsmanship more than 200 miles above the Earth, and the astronauts used pliers and scrapers wrapped with tape to provide insulation against possible electric shock.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When, after five hours of work, the images from the astronauts' helmet cameras showed the folded panels sliding gently into their boxes, relieved applause broke out in the mission control room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Curbeam then announced that he had ''one little bad piece of news,'' saying that he noticed one guide wire that had not completely retracted, and was ''kind of looped over.'' He spent a half-hour examining, and finally tugging the wire into place so that it would not present a snag hazard or scrape the delicate glass panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 7:45, about five and a half hours after the spacewalk began, the automatic latches slipped into place to lock the boxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goal of the mission is rewiring the International Space Station so it can begin drawing power from a new solar array that was installed on the side of the station on the previous mission. The new array rotates like a paddlewheel to face the Sun continuously. That array's power replaces the balky solar array, which sat atop the station as a temporary power source.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To start rotating the new array, one-half of the old array had to be retracted; if not, the new arrays would strike it. The NASA plan was to retract one-half of the array completely on this mission and to retract the other half on a mission next March. After it was locked back in its boxes, the array could be moved on a later mission to a new position on the side of the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers had hoped that the array would retract without hands-on help, as it was designed to do. But the array had stayed extended in its temporary position for six years, far longer than the original station construction plans called for. NASA officials said going into the mission that they were worried that the panels would not properly retract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partial retraction last week did provide the clearance that was needed to start up the rotating array and allowed the astronauts to conduct the two spacewalks that successfully rewired the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission managers still hoped to retract the array before the repair crew, especially the highly experienced Captain Curbeam, headed home. And so managers added a fourth spacewalk. Captain Curbeam, by leading all four, set a NASA record for the most spacewalks by an astronaut in a single mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery will return to Earth as early as Friday just before 4 p.m. Eastern time. Before then astronauts will conduct a final inspection of the shuttle's delicate external tiles and panels to see whether any damage occurred on the flight from orbital debris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an evening news conference, Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy space station program manager, said the fourth spacewalk was especially risky, since most spacewalks are planned and practiced for years. This one came together in a couple of days, he noted, with improvised tools and an array that ''was not intended to be touched with tools or hands.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA Ames Research Center and Google announced Monday that they had signed a formal agreement to collaborate on a broad set of projects that could include virtual flyovers of the Moon and Mars, and other initiatives that will make NASA's vast trove of space and weather data widely available on the Internet.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is going to bring the excitement of space travel'' to a wider audience, said S.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Worden said that as the space agency pursued new manned space missions, the technology-sharing agreement might enable people everywhere to feel the crunch of an astronaut's step as he walked on the surface of the Moon or even Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collaboration may also allow the public to track space shuttle flights or the International Space Station in real time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signing of a Space Act Agreement formalizes a planned collaboration announced in September 2005. Still, Google and NASA spoke of possible joint projects only in broad outlines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them was the possibility that, using data from NASA, Google will develop products that work like Google Earth for the Moon and other planets. Google Earth is a software program allowing users to view a three-dimensional image of the world and then zoom in to specific areas for close-up views.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently Google offers limited two-dimensional views of the moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is already known for offering compelling images from space on its Web site, said Chris C. Kemp, director of business development at Ames. The agreement with Google will allow a great expansion of the agency's offerings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kemp said the agency had already worked with several private-sector companies and was eager to work with more. ''Part of the message here is that we are open for business,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Google nor NASA would comment on specific terms of the agreement. But Mr. Worden said NASA had funds to make some data and images available to the public. Google may finance specific projects to make additional data broadly accessible and integrated into its services, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Google and NASA first announced their planned collaboration, Google said it planned to build as much as a million square feet of space at Ames Research Center. A Google executive said that project was still in preliminary planning stages.  </p>

Curbeam Jr. and Christer Fuglesang, was to start at 1:47 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. Managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hope that fixing the array problem will not take more than four and a half hours, but the spacewalkers will be equipped to stay longer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's return to Earth was pushed back a day to Friday because of the extra spacewalk. Because of supply limits, the astronauts need to return no later than Saturday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be the third spacewalk for Dr. Fuglesang since the shuttle Discovery's arrival at the International Space Station almost a week ago, and the fourth for Captain Curbeam, who will set a record for most spacewalks on a single shuttle mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the mission's three previous spacewalks, for which astronauts had several months' practice in a large swimming pool at Johnson Space Center, Monday's trip outside has been put together on the fly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a briefing on Sunday, the lead spacewalk officer, Tricia Mack, outlined a vague spacewalk plan, noting that adjustments might be made depending on how the spacewalk progressed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station's cranelike robotic arm will carry Captain Curbeam to areas of the array that need troubleshooting. Dr. Fuglesang will be floating near the base of the array and will have with him insulated tools to pass to Captain Curbeam. Based on what he sees firsthand, Captain Curbeam can flip or fan out some stuck grommets, the source of the array folding problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to send astronauts outside for a fourth time was made by NASA managers on Saturday in the middle of a spacewalk by Captain Curbeam and Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams, in which they successfully finished rewiring the orbital outpost from a temporary power source to a permanent one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the astronauts finished their tasks ahead of schedule, flight controllers asked them to inspect the half-retracted solar array, which had generated power for the station's temporary system. The old array retracted halfway by remote control Wednesday before getting stuck, and since then, the space agency has tried a number of approaches to fix it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalking pair on Saturday pushed a box into which the accordion-like, 115-foot array folds. That managed to free some stuck grommets and enabled the astronauts in the space station to retract the array farther by remote control, but then more grommets became stuck.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA considered having the current station crew or the next shuttle crew fix the array after the shuttle Discovery leaves. But managers did not believe that the three-member station crew had enough astronauts for the job, and they wanted to gain experience in solving the problem because the next shuttle crew in March will be performing similar work on another array.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers, Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy and Christer Fuglesang of the European Space Agency, completed the tricky electrical work in just two hours and moved on to more mundane tasks before ending the spacewalk at 7:41 p.m., an hour ahead of schedule. They completed the first half of the rewiring, with a second spacewalk planned for Saturday to finish the job.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past six years, the station has been running on a temporary configuration of its power system, drawing electricity from an array of solar panels atop the station. The rewiring will bring the station to its permanent arrangement, drawing power from a new array that rotates to face the sun during orbit. That array was carried to the station on the shuttle Atlantis's flight in September; more arrays may be added later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work involved a fair amount of unplugging and plugging cables in the harsh environment of space. The power cables the astronauts handled were not live; half the power network was turned off for each spacewalk. Mission managers spent much of the morning turning off equipment that was not essential -- including half the lights in the orbiting laboratory -- so critical equipment could remain in operation, receiving power from the other half of the network.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 4:45 p.m., the rewiring was complete and Stephen Robinson, an astronaut at mission control who communicates with the crew in orbit, radioed with what he called ''good news from Houston.'' And then he corrected himself: ''It's not good news, it's great news.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The components of the power system that had been connected were functioning properly, and none of the equipment would need to be replaced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ex-cellent,'' Captain Curbeam responded, stretching the word with pleasure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, which included a moment of awed appreciation of the northern lights seen from above, came after a frustrating day on Wednesday, as astronauts tried to get the old solar array to fold back into its storage box to provide clearance for the new array to rotate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old array, which has been open for six years, stubbornly refused to retract all the way, developing kinks and jams as Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy ran the motorized unit to retract it with more than 50 stop-and-start operations. Commander Williams was able to get the array retracted by 40 percent of its length, which was enough to allow the new array free movement, so mission managers decided to move on to yesterday's spacewalk and try to fully retract the array later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers, who have been discussing options since Wednesday night, appear to be leaning toward adding a spacewalk before the end of this mission to try to coax the solar array panels back into their container by hand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier yesterday, as Captain Curbeam and Mr. Fuglesang prepared for their spacewalk, the video feed on NASA TV showed the shuttle team floating around the cabin, reveling in weightlessness as they performed their tasks. But the spacewalk itself was conducted without the usual live video for much of the spacewalk, because the site was too close to the antenna required for video transmission, and mission managers did not want to expose Captain Curbeam and Mr. Fuglesang to additional electromagnetic radiation from the antenna.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation from the sun has also been a concern on this mission. A solar flare on Wednesday caused what the National Weather Service Space Environment Center called a ''moderate solar radiation storm.'' The storm has affected some radio transmissions on Earth, and has led mission managers to order the shuttle and station crews to sleep in protected areas of their craft, where there is more shielding from radiation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the rewiring complete, mission controllers turned on the cooling system so the power grid equipment would not overheat. If a problem had developed with the pumps that circulate cooling ammonia through the power network, managers would have had to order the two spacewalkers to undo all of their previous electrical work and return to the old configuration until the pump problem could be resolved -- potentially in an additional spacewalk to replace one of the 1,500-pound pumps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 5:19 p.m., Mr. Robinson let the astronauts know that the pump, which had been on the station for four years without being used, kicked on without trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Excellent,'' Captain Curbeam said again.  </p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people imagined that comets formed in total isolation from the rest of the solar system; we have shown that's not true,'' said Donald Brownlee, a University of Washington astronomer who is the lead scientist for the Stardust mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago,'' Dr. Brownlee said, ''material moved from the innermost part to the outermost part. I think of it as the solar system partially turning itself inside out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first results of Stardust, appearing in seven reports published in the Dec. 15 issue of the journal Science, were reported in San Francisco on Thursday at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA launched Stardust in 1999, and the robot spacecraft met comet Wild 2 beyond the orbit of Mars in January 2004. The craft flew within 150 miles of the comet's nucleus and trapped particles spewing from the body in a light, porous foam called aerogel. After a 2.88-billion-mile journey, Stardust returned to Earth last January with a payload of thousands of tiny particles from Wild 2.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comet formed more than 4.5 billion years ago and had remained preserved in the frozen reaches of the outer solar system until 1974, when a close encounter with Jupiter shifted its orbit to a path between Jupiter and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 180 scientists from around the world examined some of the samples with specialized equipment to determine what makes up the icy, dusty comets that largely populate a vast area beyond the orbits of Pluto and Neptune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Comet dust seems to be a real zoo of things; we see all kinds of particles that are clearly formed at different places, possibly at different times and certainly under different conditions,'' said Scott Sandford of the NASA Ames Research Center in California, who was the lead author of one of the papers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sandford said results of Stardust studies so far ''all indicate that when the solar system was forming, there was a whole lot of mixing going on.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brownlee estimates that as much as 10 percent of the material in comets came from the inner solar system. ''That's a real surprise,'' he said, ''because the common expectation was that comets would be made of interstellar dust and ice.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just dust and particles,'' he said. ''We are working on rocks -- some of them igneous rocks, formed by heating and melting. We want to know how these rocks were formed and how they became parts of comets that were formed far out on the edge of the solar system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Material from comet Wild 2 has mineral characteristics that appear to be different from those observed in comet Tempel 1. In that case, involving a spacecraft called Deep Impact, a probe crashed into Tempel 1's surface in July 2005, and the properties of the resulting dust were analyzed by the spacecraft and distant telescope observations. Dr. Brownlee noted that whereas Tempel 1 had been examined from a distance, Stardust had returned actual samples for scientists to study.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The comets may be different from each other,'' he said, ''or different observations could simply be a result of the different techniques used to examine them. It is a challenge for us to understand how they are different, and why.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael F. A'Hearn, chief scientist for the Deep Impact mission, said it was too early to say whether there were significantly different classes of comets or whether Wild 2 and Tempel 1 reflected different stages of cometary evolution. Tempel 1 has traversed the inner solar system for hundreds of years, while Wild 2 is a new arrival, Dr. A'Hearn said, and Stardust gathered surface material while Deep Impact blasted out part of the interior.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need more analysis of the data we already have,'' he said, ''and we certainly need more comet sample missions to fully understand these bodies.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A balky array of solar panels that stubbornly refused to fold back into their box threatened yesterday to derail the ambitious attempt by NASA to rewire the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day mission of the shuttle Discovery involves a complex and highly choreographed effort to alter the electrical system of the station from its current configuration, with power being drawn from a set of solar arrays atop the station, to a new arrangement that will draw power from an array that was taken up on the previous mission.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That new array will rotate like a paddlewheel so its panels continuously face the sun as the station orbits Earth. But the older solar panels block the rotation of the new one, so they must be retracted before the astronauts can proceed to the next steps of the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers hoped to get the 115-foot-long array to fold itself back into its original container. As a fallback, they said, it could be folded by 40 percent of its original length, which would get it out of the way of the new array with about 10 feet of clearance and allow the new one to rotate and for rewiring to proceed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation began just before 1:30 p.m. Eastern time and was to have been completed quickly. Instead, it stretched on through several orbits and hours of stop-and-start operations, with the panels shimmering golden and rippling in the sunlight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was a mix of tense and tedious. The astronauts were able to squeeze about 17 of the 31.5 sections, or bays, back into the box before hitting a snag. But mission managers pressed forward, since the array might eventually hinder station operations in its partly folded state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble was not unexpected; managers had fretted about being able to get an array to fold neatly after having been exposed to the harsh temperature extremes of space for so long. In briefings with reporters last month, John Curry, the lead flight director for the station during the mission, said the problem was like ''when you buy a map and it was originally all nice and compressed, and now we try to compress it back'' to its original form.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will be pleasantly surprised if that all works without a hitch,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday afternoon, mission managers could be seen on NASA television ( www.nasa.gov [http://www.nasa.gov]) discussing the issue intently, and the astronauts tried variation after variation to make the panels come together.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't get any joy on that last motion,'' the station commander, Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, said at one point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 6 p.m., Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, the astronaut who operated the motorized mast, was trying to retract the array a bit at a time, calling out ''Ready ready now'' before each movement, and ''Abort'' at the end of each. That incremental approach got them down to just fewer than 17 bays, ''well within the safety restrictions,'' said Kyle Herring, a NASA public affairs officer for the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As hopes of getting the array fully retracted faded, managers decided to leave it in its partly retracted state for the moment so they could start the rotating array and prepare for the scheduled spacewalk today to carry out the rewiring process.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, NASA announced that it was going to build a base on the Moon. Two days later, in what was sort of a funeral valedictory for the Mars Global Surveyor, which recently passed into silence and is presumed dead in orbit, scientists said that photographs it took over the last seven years showed changes caused by rivulets running down crater walls.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, had already convinced most Mars experts that there was water on the planet's surface long ago. Last week's announcement was the best evidence so far that it is still there, under the red sand. This was the most tantalizing news yet for the diehards who still hope that there might have once been life on Mars, or that microbial Martians might still be nestled in dark warm recesses, waiting for visitors from another world to read the message written in whatever genomic language has been carved out of chemistry, starlight and time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's announcement underscored the unmatched mystique of Mars. It was enough to make you want to go there, or at least send a probe to dig in those gullies, drill the sands, bring back some mud and put it under the microscope to see if anything -- some bacterium that would change history -- is swimming.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably that mystical microbe is not there. We all remember the flap over alleged evidence of life in the famous Mars meteorite back in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We science fiction fans rise to the bait again and again like dumb trout to the shiny fly -- only to bounce back to Earth, and to our loneliness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say that NASA is not doing enough to explore Mars. There are three working orbiters and two rovers there now, and another craft will land near the planet's North Pole in a year. But the plan to retrieve a chunk of Martian soil and bring it back to Earth for scrutiny has been delayed until the middle of the next decade, budget permitting. It makes you wonder again: Why, if Mars is so fascinating, does NASA now have a fixation on the Moon? In last week's first announcement, the agency said it would build a permanent international base, probably near one of the Moon's poles, by 2024.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of those twists that must make it fun to be the American starship commander these days, that is to say, the NASA administrator, the dual (one is tempted to say dueling) announcements underscored the disparity between these two visions of space adventure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand there is the Red Planet, home of mythical canals and yearning. Astrobiologists are dying to get their hands, or at least their robots, on it -- oops, astrobiology research was slashed in the last NASA budget.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars has water, apparently, and an atmosphere that greater minds than mine contend could be transformed and thickened enough to breathe, and maybe even past or future life forms. Someday, a few dreamers say, our descendants could walk to a pool of water in the red sand, like the settlers in Ray Bradbury's ''Martian Chronicles,'' look at their reflections and see Martians.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the discussions about the space program that flare in this country about once a decade, usually after some shuttle catastrophe, Mars emerges as the favorite goal of human exploration. Both President Bushes invoked it as a goal in reinvigorating the space program. Both times we got something else.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand there is the Moon, by all accounts a dead cinder. Recent attempts to find water there, in the form of hypothesized ice sheets at the poles, have come up empty, which would seem to pose a problem for long-term settlement. NASA's imagineers see the ice as a source for both water and rocket fuel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It feels as if we've been down this road before. NASA likes to compare the lunar base to bases in Antarctica, where nations have cooperated to save and explore the frozen continent. But the whole thing sounds to me more reminiscent of the early days and promises of the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, too, we had international partners for a facility that could grow and sprawl, something that would be a science lab, a spaceport, a training ground for the future. We all know how that came out. Today the space station is a giant turkey in the sky. It is being assembled as fast as possible for an uncertain future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These things, shuttles, space stations, Moon colonies, are always advertised as necessary way stations. But they wind up being destinations and sinkholes of money themselves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientific community seems to have a lukewarm reception to the lunar base idea, fearing that it will suck money from science. NASA declined to put a price tag on the Moon base, saying it would be financed by savings from closing down the shuttle and space station construction. But few scientists or outside experts think the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, has been given enough money to accomplish even those intermediary goals. As a result, NASA had to back away last year from a previous promise not to take ''one thin dime'' from the agency's science budget to pay for human exploration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not a promising precedent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the Moon base could disappear like raindrops in the desert during the four presidential administrations and nine Congresses to come between now and 2024.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, in some quarters there is a feeling that NASA should get out of human spaceflight altogether and leave the task to entrepreneurs like Richard Branson, who recently expressed a willingness to give Stephen Hawking a ride on his coming Virgin Galactic spaceline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's need to avoid all risk drives the price of human space flight cosmically high, said Martin Rees, a cosmologist at Cambridge University and Britain's astronomer royal. He asked in an e-mail message, ''Does the U.S. public really want to spend tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars on transport and support for the cast of a long-running 'Big Brother' or 'Truman Show'?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giving up human adventures, or cutting them back, would leave plenty of money for the inspirational science, like the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars rovers and the Titan lander, which have carried NASA's water during the last uninspiring shuttle decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to give Dr. Griffin, a real rocket scientist, credit for his ability to make tough calls, cut Gordian knots of bureaucracy in the space program and steer his ship decisively. It's just that I worry he is zooming off in the wrong direction.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 9 -- Night became day on Saturday as the shuttle Discovery muscled its way off of the launching pad with a shuddering roar on a mission to rewire the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a blinding streak of yellow flame that left a mark on the retina and a lump in the throat, the shuttle and its crew of seven astronauts lifted off at 8:47 p.m. in the program's first nighttime launching in more than four years.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second launching attempt for the Discovery. Weather concerns forced mission managers to scrub on Thursday, and on Friday the forecast was even worse. Early Saturday, there were high crosswinds here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center landing strip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the winds died and the weather improved as the evening progressed, and the mission management team ultimately gave approval for launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before beginning the final countdown, the shuttle launching director, Michael D. Leinbach, polled his team and then called to the Discovery's commander, Mark L. Polansky, using his nickname.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''O.K., Roman, 48 hours makes a tremendous difference,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''The weather is outstanding, the vehicle is in great shape, so we wish you all good luck, Godspeed, and we'll see you back here in 12 days.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After liftoff, the firing room erupted in cheers and applause, and Mr. Leinbach said, ''Calm down now, we've got eight minutes to orbit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those eight minutes passed with exceeding smoothness. The crew and the launching team calmly communicated the milestones of reaching orbit: the ''go at throttle up'' call about a minute into flight as the shuttle passed through the zone of maximum turbulence; the separation of the solid rocket boosters; the main engine cutoff; and the separation of the external tank. Discovery was well on its way to catching up with the space station on Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, liftoffs have taken place during the day so NASA analysts can look for the kind of liftoff debris that doomed that shuttle and its crew. This nighttime launching made it harder to make out any debris in the images from the camera on the shuttle's external fuel tank, but those images and data from radar and other sensors will be scrutinized for signs of damage to the craft. ''We'll have lots of looks at it,'' said LeRoy Cain, the head of the launching mission management team.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day mission promises to be one of the most complex in the history of the shuttle program. The astronauts are to install a stubby extension to the station's structure and reconfigure its electrical system to receive power from new solar arrays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission also includes a tricky effort to coax a solar array that has been standing atop the station for six years to fold itself into a more compact form, out of the way so that the new array can rotate to face the sun continuously.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work will prepare the station to generate the power it will need for the next rounds of construction and expansion, and to meet the needs of a crew that will eventually double to six from three. Spacewalkers will unplug and reattach 112 power connectors in the process.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rewiring is risky. Half of the space station's electrical system will be powered down as its wiring is reconfigured, and then brought up again. Then, in another spacewalk, the astronauts will shut down the other half of the station's electrical system. Crucial systems will remain online, since they can receive power from either power network. But some lights, communications systems and other components will be turned off during each of the two rewiring spacewalks, and mission managers have fretted about what might happen if those do not come back online.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, after the power procedure is complete, the astronauts must start cooling pumps that will control the temperature of the circuit control boxes. The pumps have not been used in four years, and that, too, has managers sweating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two members of the Discovery's crew -- Commander Polansky, a former Air Force test pilot, and Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy -- have been to space before. The rest of the crew members will be taking their first trip, including the pilot, Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy; Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy; Nicholas J. M. Patrick; Joan E. Higginbotham; and Christer Fuglesang, the first Swedish astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Williams will remain on the space station for six-months, and Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency, who has been living on the station, will climb aboard the shuttle for his ride back to earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the post-liftoff briefing on Saturday night, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said the shuttle and the station were now part of a larger effort to return to the work of sending humans to explore the Moon and the planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to learn to live on other planetary surfaces,'' Mr. Griffin said, ''and use what we find there and bend it to our will -- just as the pilgrims did when they came to what is now New England.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is part of what it takes ''to become a space-faring nation,'' he said, adding that it is up to NASA to make that happen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes we stumble,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''Today, we didn't stumble.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 8 -- NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, says the current period of space exploration will come to be seen as a mistake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Viewed from the point of history several decades out,'' he said in an interview, ''the period where the United States retreated from the Moon and quite deliberately focused only on low Earth orbit will be seen, to me, a mistake.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin has made similar comments before, notably a year ago in an interview with USA Today. This time, his remarks came as he waited for Thursday's down-to-the-wire effort to launch the shuttle on a 12-day mission to rewire the International Space Station. The liftoff was scrubbed at the last minute because of weather concerns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers decided not to try to launch on Friday, when weather conditions were predicted to be too cloudy and windy for a safe launching. They expect to try again at 8:47 p.m. on Saturday, though the decision about whether to proceed will not be made until weather officers give their prediction early that morning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching opportunities extend to Dec. 26, though space agency officials hope to get the shuttle to orbit long before then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin was appointed to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 2005, a year after President Bush announced his ''vision for space exploration,'' which calls for returning astronauts to the Moon by 2020 and then moving on to send humans to Mars. Mr. Griffin has from the start been an enthusiastic proponent of that plan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has put him in a delicate situation, as he has shifted NASA financing to the Moon initiative, while moving to complete the space station and shut down the shuttle program by 2010, and cutting back on its science activities. And in doing so, he has occasionally expressed doubts about the wisdom underlying the nation's decision to build the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his remarks a year ago, he issued an apologetic memorandum to NASA employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if there was any discomfort in expressing such opinions once again at the Kennedy Space Center in the midst of preparations for launching, Mr. Griffin showed none. He said in the interview that his comments had been broadly misconstrued as a slap against the people who build and maintain the shuttle and space station, and emphasized that he admired the people of NASA who took on enormous challenges to create the shuttle and station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fault is not NASA's, he said, adding: ''The space shuttle is a response to a policy mistake -- it isn't the mistake. The mistake was tearing up all the infrastructure that we built for Apollo and saying, 'let's just focus on low Earth orbit.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan to return to the Moon by 2020 has been met with some skepticism, especially among those who doubt that the space agency can take on such a daunting project within its $17 billion annual budget. Dr. Griffin said that NASA could do the job -- and could reach the moon even more quickly, with more money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm tempted to say, 'Why the skepticism?' '' he said, adding, ''but in fairness, NASA's recent history has not had the on-time, on-budget performance characteristic of the Apollo era. And I'm trying to restore that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that Democrats won the majority of seats in Congress in the November election, and other political changes that will occur over time, should have little effect on the plan, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless you believe that a future U.S. president or a future U.S. Congress actually wants to cancel the U.S. spaceflight program, then I actually do not perceive a big threat from changing administrations and changing Congresses,'' he said. ''I think the country wants to have a manned spaceflight program, and a substantial one.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger D. Launius, the chairman of the division of space history at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, expressed surprise that Mr. Griffin would repeat his statement about the judgment of history after the controversy that erupted a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here we've got a guy who speaks his mind,'' Mr. Launius said. ''That's not always the case, certainly in Washington, and it certainly hasn't been the case at NASA.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while some of the criticism is justified, Mr. Launius said, the shuttle ''turned out better than it had any right to,'' and stands today as something of an engineering marvel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee and the incoming head of the House Committee on Science, declined to address Mr. Griffin's comments about the history of the space effort, saying through a spokeswoman: ''I would rather focus on where we go from here. I support human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. However, it's got to be paid for.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years after President Bush announced an ambitious long-term goal to return astronauts to the Moon and then send them on to Mars, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has finally put some flesh on his nebulous aspirations. This week, the agency announced plans to establish a permanent base on the Moon by 2024, explained why we should want to send astronauts back to a world they visited repeatedly more than three decades ago, and described what they might do when they get there. It was belated justification for a decision that the Bush administration and Congress have already made. But the payoff is distant and the likely future costs very high, leaving it unclear how realistic these aspirations will prove to be.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has done a commendably thorough job by consulting some 1,000 experts and 13 other space agencies in fashioning its plans. Such a costly and difficult venture should ideally be pursued cooperatively with other nations, to share the costs and the risks. It would be especially desirable to have multiple ways of reaching the Moon in case the American program runs into problems like those that grounded the shuttles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worrisome about the new plans is their lack of focus. The agency cites six major reasons for returning to the Moon. The most persuasive is to use the Moon as a base to test technologies and operating techniques to be used on future missions to Mars, a more compelling target. It makes sense to first try ''living off the land'' on the Moon, where astronauts are only days away from home should something go wrong, before taking the long leap to Mars. The venture is also justified on scientific, economic, educational and global partnership grounds, and as a step toward eventual settlements on the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wide sweep of these rationales is reminiscent of the extravagant promises for the space station, which was sold to Congress as a steppingstone to the planets, a scientific and economic bonanza, and a stimulus for students but is still limping along, half finished and far over budget, with greatly diminished expectations for what it can accomplish.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even more expansive document -- listing some 180 objectives that the astronauts might pursue on the Moon -- is essentially a wish list compiled after consulting virtually every expert in the world who might have an opinion. The list puts the lie to criticisms that there is almost nothing useful to do on the Moon. But some of the objectives have a pie-in-the-sky quality, like exporting power from the Moon for use on Earth, while others, like observatories on the Moon, might not prove feasible or affordable for decades. The objectives will need to be winnowed and focused if they are to serve as useful guides in pursuing the program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this nation is to continue a human space flight program it makes sense to pick a more exciting destination than a space station circling endlessly in low Earth orbit. Our main concern is that the political proponents of the Moon-Mars adventure will not provide money commensurate with the task. NASA's crowning scientific achievements have come from its unmanned probes to distant worlds and its orbiting observatories. It would be a shame if an underfinanced program to return to the Moon on a permanent basis and then venture on to Mars forced reductions in research programs of higher scientific value.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the clock ticking down toward the 9:35 blastoff time, Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, called the commander, Mark L. Polansky, using his nickname. ''O.K., Roman, we gave it our best shot,'' Mr. Leinbach said, and explained they could not assume the clouds would clear in time for launching.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mike, we understand, and thanks to the team for all their hard work,'' Mr. Polansky replied. ''Try not to be too disappointed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather has been a concern for the mission in recent days at Cape Canaveral and at three emergency landing sites in Europe. At the cape, low clouds and gusting winds exceeded NASA's limits for safe launching, with the probability that weather would cause a delay rising from 20 percent early in the week to 60 percent by Thursday. Mission managers have decided to forgo a launching attempt on Friday, when conditions are expected to be even worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers kept their launching hopes alive until minutes before 9:35 p.m., the scheduled blastoff time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On any given day, the launching window is very narrow -- usually about 10 minutes, and just five for Thursday -- as the Kennedy Space Center falls within the orbital plane of the space station. If conditions do not allow launching during the window, the opportunity for the entire day is lost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The span of days available to launch in December stretches until Dec. 26. Managers hope to get the crew off the ground by Dec. 17 for the 12-day mission, however, so that they can avoid a problem that has never arisen before: the shuttle's computer system was not designed to function over the change of a year. The computers would have to be reset on Jan. 1 -- something mission control is loath to try in space. But mission managers have said that it is possible to reset the computers in space and that the crew is trained to perform the operation. If time runs out, NASA may push ahead with the later launching, so long as the reset occurs while the shuttle is connected to the station in case anything goes wrong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if mission managers decide against trying the reset in space, they will have to postpone the beginning of the mission until January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Michael Griffin, the administrator of NASA, said he was not worried about getting Discovery off the ground. ''We've got many days in this window to launch,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''We're fine.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 -- Pictures of Martian gullies taken several years apart strongly suggest that water still flows at least occasionally on the surface of the planet, scientists announced Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While water ice and water vapor have long been known to exist below the surface of Mars in the relatively recent past, and water ice has been seen at the poles, this is ''the strongest evidence to date that water still flows occasionally on the surface of Mars,'' said Michael Meyer, the lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If water is present, that would raise the possibility of microbial life: with water and some form of steady heat, bacteria can grow even in hostile environments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new images were taken by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which fell silent last month after almost 10 years of observing the planet from orbit. They show light-colored deposits in two gullies within crater walls that were not there in pictures taken in 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The before-and-after pictures show what appear to be deposits of materials left by bursts of water flowing down the sides of the gullies, said Michael Malin, chief scientist for the spacecraft's camera system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if the material were carried by flowing water,'' Mr. Malin said in a televised news conference held here at NASA headquarters. The deposits appeared to have been left by a liquid mixed with dirt or other material that flowed down a slope for hundreds of yards before dispersing, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think water was the fluidizing material here,'' said Mr. Malin, president of Malin Space Science Systems of San Diego, the operator of the spacecraft's camera.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the evidence is circumstantial, the possibility of liquid water on Mars is exciting, Mr. Malin said. It raises the questions of where the water comes from and whether it could be used as a resource for future explorers. For instance, water could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, which could be used as rocket fuel, or the oxygen could be used for astronauts to breathe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Edgett, another scientist with Mr. Malin's company, said that whenever the surface of Mars was disturbed by spacecraft on the ground or by strikes from space rocks, it appeared as a dark color. The light tone of the material in the flow patterns suggests that it came from minerals or other chemicals that were in the water, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bright features persist for several years,'' Mr. Edgett said, ''which means it's not likely to be frost and is likely to be sediment from water flow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers said they believed that underground water slowly made its way to the surface, perhaps accumulating under a crust of ice until being released in a sudden burst by a quake or a meteor strike.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When freed, Mr. Edgett said, the water shoots out as if from a squirt gun and immediately begins evaporating or boiling away as it flows downhill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flow appears to be from a thick, sediment-laden material that moves like a mudslide that occasionally courses around obstacles and diverts into finger-shaped marks as it disperses at the bottom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water in the flow would evaporate or turn into ice crystals within hours or days, laving sediment along its path.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Edgett said that the photographed flow patterns traveled down slopes for 500 to 600 yards and each probably carried the equivalent of ''5 to 10 swimming pools of water.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper to be published Friday in the journal Science, the researchers said pictures of the same areas taken in 2004 and 2005 clearly showed changes that occurred since initial images taken in 1999. While some scientists have suggested that past flow evidence seen in craters might be from landslides or rocks falling down slopes, geological properties of the crater areas strongly suggest that the changes were caused by a fluid, probably water, the researchers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip R. Christensen, a professor of geological science at Arizona State University who was not involved with the research, said he had been skeptical of previous claims about signs of flowing water on present-day Mars but found the new evidence ''reasonable and plausible.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm about 80 percent convinced that this is evidence of water flow happening now, and I admit I have been a skeptic,'' he said in an interview. ''We're now realizing Mars is more active than we previously thought.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 5 -- The space shuttle Discovery is to begin a complex 11-day round trip to the International Space Station as early as Thursday night, lighting up the skies in the first nighttime launching in four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the weather and technology cooperate, the shuttle and its crew of seven astronauts will be launched just before 9:36 p.m. The fiery blastoff should be visible along much of the Eastern Seaboard; weather permitting, even New Yorkers will be able to see it along the south-southwest horizon about seven minutes after liftoff.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will appear as a very bright, pulsating, fast-moving star, shining with a yellowish-orange glow,'' about as bright as Jupiter, which is often visible in city skies, said Joe Rao, an associate and guest lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium in New York, in an e-mail message.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No technical problems that would necessarily delay the mission have been announced, and the likelihood of favorable weather is 60 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an evening news briefing, NASA mission managers said that their teams continued to work through remaining issues leading up to the launching, including a power surge detected at the launching pad, said LeRoy Cain, NASA's launching integration director. Nonetheless, he added, "We're on track, and on target for Thursday."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last nighttime launching was in November 2002, two months before the ill-fated mission of the shuttle Columbia. Foam debris shed during the Columbia's liftoff punched a hole in a wing, allowing superheated gases to enter the craft and break it apart when it re-entered earth's atmosphere 16 days later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, shuttles have been launched in daylight so cameras can capture detailed images of any liftoff debris. Now, NASA managers say they are confident that they have learned enough from those images and that other sensors will provide them with any data they need.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two members of the Discovery's crew -- the commander, Mark L. Polansky, a former Air Force test pilot, and Capt. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. of the Navy -- have been to space before. It will be the first trip to space for the rest of the crew: Cmdr. William A. Oefelein of the Navy, the pilot; Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy; Nicholas J. M. Patrick; Joan E. Higginbotham; and Christer Fuglesang, the first Swedish astronaut and a representative of the European Space Agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle will leave Commander Williams on the space station for a six-month stay and bring Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency back to earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 20th mission to the station involves significant challenges, mission managers say. Astronauts will add a small structural truss to the orbiting laboratory and reconfigure the station's electrical system to begin drawing power from solar panels added on the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will have to retract a set of solar arrays that have been sitting atop the station for about six years so the new arrays can turn on their axis like a paddlewheel and continuously face the sun as the station orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers acknowledge that the panels may not automatically refurl into their holders. John Curry, the lead flight director for the station during this mission, used this analogy in a briefing last month: ''When you buy a map and it was originally all nice and compressed, and now we try to compress it back'' to its original form.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will be pleasantly surprised if that all works without a hitch,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If necessary, there are backup plans to retract the arrays manually.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers also fret over the complications involved in powering down half of the station at a time for the rewiring work; they say the question of whether everything will smoothly power up again is a nail-biter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course, the biggest concern is the one that never goes away. Commander Polansky said last month that the space agency had learned from the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a lot of confidence that the program has done everything they possibly can to make the vehicle as safe as it could be,'' he said. ''That's how I go to sleep at night, and how I look my family in the eye.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 -- NASA announced plans on Monday for a permanent base on the Moon, to be started soon after astronauts return there around 2020.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's deputy administrator, Shana Dale, said the United States would develop rockets and spacecraft to get people to the Moon and establish a rudimentary base. There, other countries and commercial enterprises could expand the outpost to develop scientific and other interests, Ms. Dale said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dale and other officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the agency envisioned a base at one of the lunar poles, to take advantage of the near-constant sunlight for solar power generation. It would have an ''open architecture'' design to which others could add the capabilities they want.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Horowitz, NASA's associate administrator for exploration, said crews of four astronauts would make weeklong missions to the Moon starting around 2020.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more equipment was set up, human stays would eventually grow to 180 days, and become permanent by 2024. By 2027, officials said, a pressurized roving vehicle on the surface would take people on expeditions far from the base.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA gave no cost estimate for the program and no design details for the base. Ms. Dale said all plans assumed that the agency would continue operating from a fixed budget of about $17 billion a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle fleet is to be retired by 2010, and the United States plans to scale back its involvement in the International Space Station. The station is still under construction, with a mission by the shuttle Discovery to lift off on Thursday. Ms. Dale said money would be shifted to the lunar exploration program from the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Bush administration and NASA have spoken in general terms about plans for a return to the Moon, followed by human spaceflight to Mars, the lunar outpost plan is the first time officials have proposed a permanent presence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going for a base on the Moon,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''It's a very, very big decision.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many gaps in the plan remain to be filled in. NASA called Monday's announcement a baseline concept.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a televised news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston on the eve of an international conference there on space exploration, Ms. Dale said the plan was developed after consultation with space agencies representing 14 countries and more than 1,000 experts in space science and commerce.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The door is open for international and commercial interests,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lunar base plan is part of a larger effort to develop an international exploration strategy, one that explains why and how humans are returning to the Moon and what they plan to do when they get there, NASA officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planning includes an international conference early next year on setting scientific goals for returning to the Moon, including those that private interests might want to pursue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Cooke, the agency official who led the lunar study group, said the plan called for putting a lander craft down near a polar crater and later adding solar-power generating units and living quarters to establish a base.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A site near the lunar South Pole, like the Shackleton Crater, would provide enough sunlight for power generation. It is also near possible deposits of valuable minerals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From this site, Mr. Cooke said, other nations could add scientific laboratories or observatories, and commercial concerns might want to process rocket fuel and other products from water and other materials that might be found in the ground nearby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said having a base did not mean that humans would go there after every lunar landing. The option remains open for some missions to go to equatorial regions, as the Apollo project landers did in the 1970s, or even to the other side of the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting to the Moon and establishing a base will require a versatile, general-purpose lander that could land anywhere and be the core of an outpost, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nickname I use for the lander is, it's a pickup truck,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''You can put whatever you want in the back. You can take it to wherever you want. So you can deliver cargo, crew, do it robotically, do it with humans on board. These are the types of things we're looking for in this system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dale said she and other NASA officials would spend part of next year visiting potential partners in the lunar project, like the space agencies of Europe, Russia and Japan, to see what they might want to contribute. Different aspects of a lunar base might come from many agreements between the United States and other nations, she said, rather than following the model of the space station of having many partners signing one agreement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there have been preliminary talks about cooperation in space with China, a growing space power which along with the United States and Russia has the ability to launch humans, it is too early to tell whether the two nations will agree to work together on human space flight projects such as the lunar base, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard McCurdy, a NASA expert who is a professor at the school of public affairs at American University in Washington, expressed some skepticism about whether the space agency could make the ambitious plan fit in its budget, even with the winding down of the shuttle program and ''throwing the keys to the International Space Station'' to the other nations that helped to build it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By relying on some of the ideas and technologies developed during the Apollo program and beyond, Mr. McCurdy said, NASA planners expect to be able to get back to the Moon for 40 percent to 60 percent of the original cost. There would be savings, too, in not having to reinvent technologies for protecting spacecraft from the heat of re-entry into the atmosphere, and not having to develop new launching facilities from scratch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said he was concerned that the technology for lunar exploration ''won't get us beyond the Moon'' and on to Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fear is that the Moon, which is now viewed as a means to get beyond the Moon, will become its own destination, for hundreds of years,'' he said. ''The easy way to go to the Moon is the hard way to go to Mars.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA has yet to design the permanent camp, last July officials at the Johnson Space Center took reporters on a tour of possible lunar habitats to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mock-ups were built of plywood and plastic, and had the crowded feel of a FEMA trailer. They addressed problems that NASA engineers expected astronauts living on the Moon to encounter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dust, for example, is not just untidy. On the Moon, the particles tend to be jagged and sticky, and so the engineers have designed an airlock to allow dust removal after any trip outside.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''A Home Away From Home''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of NASA's first priorities will be to determine where to place the proposed Moon base. NASA is focusing on areas on the Moon's poles that receive increased sunlight, which could power the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOP CANDIDATE  </p>

As the Columbia catastrophe forced a two-and-a-half-year delay in construction missions by the shuttle fleet, and as cost overruns and changing presidential administrations forced NASA to rethink its entire science mission, the station's price tag has ballooned to $100 billion and the completion date has moved to 2010. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And questions about the station's scientific value have grown sharper than ever. David J. Goldston, the departing chief of staff for the House Science Committee, said in an interview that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration now seemed more motivated by the need to satisfy its commitments to international partners than by any compelling scientific objectives. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never heard anyone say, 'We have to do this because it's important for the future of the U.S. space program or science,' '' Mr. Goldston said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now focused heavily on building a new generation of space vehicles for exploring the Moon and Mars; yesterday it announced plans to establish an international base camp on the Moon by 2024. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials insist that today's space system is a crucial element of building tomorrow's. In particular, they say, the station is essential for researching the potential effects of prolonged weightlessness on astronauts: a round trip to Mars, as envisioned by President Bush in his long-term goals for human spaceflight, would take at least two years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the agency has also sharply cut back plans for scientific experiments. Plans to take equipment like a 10-ton centrifuge module, which was developed by the Japanese space agency and which could spin to produce artificial gravity for experiments on small animals, have been canceled. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget crunch for the program is so pronounced that this year, the station program manager, Michael T. Suffredini, looked into having all NASA science experiments aboard the station shut down during the 2007 fiscal year. (He has since backed away from that idea.) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with tight budgets, NASA faces an even tighter deadline: completing the station by 2010, when the agency is planning to retire the shuttle fleet. The next generation of vehicles will not be ready before 2014, leaving the world dependent on the Russian and European space programs, and potentially on entrepreneurs partly financed by NASA, for access to the station. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion of a completed station with such limited access, and potentially limited utility, led Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, to ask NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, in April, ''Is this going to be a techno-whoops?'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin responded, ''I certainly hope not,'' and explained that the need to complete the station and to develop tomorrow's space fleet has meant making choices about how best to use the station during the construction process. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science work in orbit had to be narrowed, he testified, with a tight focus on conducting scientific work that can help the space agency keep astronauts healthy on long missions to the Moon and Mars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA cannot do everything that our many constituencies would like us to do within our $16.8 billion budget,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risks of space travel are anything but tamed. Maintaining the station and its equipment is a continuing challenge. Maintaining astronauts' health may be an even greater one. Experts say that in zero gravity they suffer from osteoporosis at a rate 10 times that of postmenopausal women. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a trip to Mars, 40 percent of them would lose more than half of the bone mineral in their hips, according to James A. Pawelczyk, an assistant professor of physiology and kinesiology at Pennsylvania State University and a former astronaut. The returning spacefarers would have hips as delicate as eggshells. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muscle mass also declines, and efforts to prevent the process have not been very successful, said Julie Robinson, the acting manager of science projects for the station program. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, we can say we've made progress, but we're not where we need to be for exploration missions,'' she said. Outside experts have had reservations about the shift. In a report this year, the National Research Council said the space agency lacked a strong plan for scientific research or for use of the space station ''in support of the exploration missions.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not formally responded, but Dr. Robinson said the science was gearing up along the lines suggested by the report. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increasing emphasis on the next step has left many experts worried that the orbiting laboratory is being treated like an albatross, to be cast aside as quickly as possible. ''Low-earth orbit'' -- the station orbits some 220 miles above the Earth -- ''should not be abandoned in favor of going to the Moon and Mars,'' said Jeff M. Bingham, the staff director for the Senate Commerce subcommittee on science and space. ''We're sort of saying, not too fast.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current law requires that 15 percent of the station's science budget still be devoted to the hard science research that was originally acclaimed in the 1990s. The legislation also officially declares the station a national laboratory, a move intended to open the station more broadly to research and financing from outside agencies and businesses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In defense of the station's potential, Mr. Bingham points out that it is just half finished and has half the six-member crew that the fully completed station is designed to support. ''It's not a space station that is or should be expected to be producing anything of any significance by now,'' he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists hoping to conduct research in the microgravity environment of the station say the new focus on the Moon and Mars has done great damage to their field. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since 1990, NASA has spent literally billions of dollars building up a world-class microgravity program that has been basically squandered,'' said Peter W. Voorhees, a professor of engineering at Northwestern University. ''There's a perfect example of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have talked of a return to the science focus once the next generation of vehicles is available to get projects up to the completed station, Dr. Voorhees said, but he added: ''The problem with this is the science community is not like a water faucet you can turn off and on at will. If you turn it off now, it will be extraordinarily difficult to turn it on again down the line.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Important scientific work will be done in space, said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. But it may be conducted by international partners after the United States has shifted its focus to the Moon. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be ironic,'' Mr. Logsdon said, ''if research breakthroughs came through the work of our partners, rather than research that we've chosen to forgo.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station's principal role, suggested John E. Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a group that monitors military and scientific programs, may be as ''an insurance policy, to retain a toehold in orbit, in space -- to keep the program going until we can figure out a new reason for doing it.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst case, he said, would be a variant of the ''techno-whoops'' hypothesis: a national failure of will that would leave the Moon initiative stalled and the science program mothballed. ''Maybe we'll find out that spaceflight turned out to be a historical aberration, like zeppelins,'' he said, adding: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would be the end of the frontier. I just don't want to go there.'' </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a two-day meeting to review the mission at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the shuttle Discovery would be launched next Thursday at 9:35 p.m., the first night launching in four years.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA has restricted the three shuttle launchings to daylight hours so that it could take detailed photographs and measurements to assure that safety modifications made after the accident were working. Columbia and its crew of seven were lost while returning to Earth because foam debris from the external fuel tank damaged the craft during the launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we're all ready to resume night launches,'' N. Wayne Hale, NASA's shuttle program director, said at a televised news conference after the meeting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale and William Gerstenmaier, the agency's associate administrator for space flight, said radar and images taken during liftoff using light generated by the shuttle's rocket engines should be able to spot any potentially damaging debris even in surrounding darkness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were really no dissenting opinions on the night launch,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said data from the three previous flights launched in daylight showed that modifications had greatly reduced the danger from debris. The added data, he said, allowed NASA engineers to refine their calculations of the debris hazard risk and reclassify it from ''probable catastrophic'' to ''infrequent catastrophic.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space shuttle flights remain hazardous, he said, but the debris hazard now can be placed in perspective with other risks, such as those posed by the craft's rocket engines and meteoroids striking the ship in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not nearly as bad as we thought last summer,'' Mr. Hale said. ''We're concerned, but we're not nearly as frightened as before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA needs the option of launching the shuttle at night if it is to meet a busy schedule to complete the space station by 2010, when the shuttle fleet is to be retired.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its scheduled 12-day mission, Discovery and its crew of seven are to deliver a metal truss segment to extend the space station's structural backbone. In addition, astronauts are to conduct three space walks to help rewire the electrical and cooling systems, and retract a solar power panel that has been supplying the station with electricity for six years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said the mission is so complex because it involves changing the station's entire electrical system, including switching most of the outpost's equipment off and powering it up again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This task will keep both the astronauts and ground crews busier than ever before to get it done right, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a typical day, he said, the space station gets 800 commands from the ground. During this mission, more than 4,000 commands are scheduled for execution during a critical three-day period, he added.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year-old spacecraft -- which mapped the Martian surface, recorded seasonal and annual climate changes, and gathered evidence of water in the planet's past -- has not communicated with flight controllers since Nov. 2. A disabled solar power array is the prime suspect.  </p>

Dr. Meyer spoke at a news teleconference from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the mission is being directed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuk K. Li, the laboratory's Mars program manager, said the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the newest spacecraft to explore the planet, drew blanks in several attempts on Friday and Monday to make a photographic inspection of the Global Surveyor. Given that failure, mission officials said yesterday that they had exhausted the most likely means of re-establishing radio communications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two spacecraft regularly passed within 60 miles of each other. But in the last three weeks, ground antennas have not been able to track the Global Surveyor's orbit to fix its probable position, which could have been altered by the malfunction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While we have not exhausted everything we have to do,'' Dr. Li said, ''we believe the prospect of recovery of Mars Global Surveyor is not looking very good at all.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers said they planned a long-shot effort to communicate with the spacecraft through one of the two roving vehicles still operating on the Martian surface. This week, flight controllers will radio a command for the Global Surveyor to use its transmitter to send signals that could be picked up by the rover Opportunity. Any message would be relayed to Earth through yet another spacecraft, the Mars Odyssey.  </p>

The craft was designed to operate for a minimum of one Mars year, or 25 Earth months. It kept going for almost five Mars years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Thorpe, the Global Surveyor manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the spacecraft had cost $156 million to build and launch and $20 million annually to operate the first few years, then about $6 million in each recent year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's cameras and scientific instruments discovered many fresh gullies etching the planet's surface, presumably evidence of relatively recent erosion by liquid water. An infrared detector found concentrations of hematite, a mineral that often forms under wet conditions.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the Hubble Space Telescope was in the news, it had been figuratively tied to the railroad tracks and left for dead by Sean O'Keefe, then the NASA administrator. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the wreck of the space shuttle Columbia, Mr. O'Keefe, who even had a mustache suitable for diabolical twirling, declared an end to the astronaut service calls that had kept the Hubble eye alive and on its game, all but ensuring that its string of matchless cosmic postcards would cease by the end of the decade. </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, night was already falling. A main instrument, a spectrograph, stopped operating two years ago. The main camera stopped working for two weeks this fall. The telescope has been limping along on two of the six gyroscopes that provide pointing and stability in an effort to harbor reserves for the long years ahead. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. O'Keefe's successor, Michael D. Griffin, sprung the Hubble from the rails, announcing that he would send an astronaut crew in spring 2008 to rejuvenate the telescope one more time. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision ensures that if all goes well, the Hubble will continue to send back those postcards long after the space shuttles that launched and nurtured it have been trucked to the bone yards and the museums. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles are scheduled to be retired in 2010 to make way for the Crew Exploration Vehicle that will take people back to the Moon and onward to Mars. But with refurbishing, the telescope will work until at least 2013, astronomers say, and will remain in orbit until 2021 or beyond. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is appropriate that the telescope will be the last robot standing in what has been a long and tense marriage between science and the space truck. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before the shuttle was a glean in NASA's eye -- long before NASA even existed -- there was the idea of a space telescope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late Princeton astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed way back in 1946 that a telescope in space would free astronomers from the curse of looking through air, which distorts and blurs images and blocks many forms of radiation from the heavens. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope has endured a Perils of Pauline existence. In the early 1970s, advocates of the telescope hooked their dreams to the planned space shuttle, designing the Hubble to be launched into a relatively low orbit that the shuttle could reach and to be serviced by astronauts and even retrieved back to the ground, a demonstration of the glories of the new era in manned spaceflight. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan was not popular among many scientists who thought that the shuttle was a boondoggle, that the telescope should be higher so that the Earth would not block so much of its view and that it would be cheaper to build if it did not have to be repaired by someone wearing boxing gloves. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was clear, said John Bahcall, the late Princeton astrophysicist who was deeply involved in the telescope his whole life, that if the telescope did not go on the shuttle, the telescope would not go at all. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an imperfect marriage,'' he said in an interview two years ago. ''The shuttle was the only bride available.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a Catch-22 in which NASA justified the shuttle by its ability to support scientific projects like the telescope and then justified cutting the science budget to pay for the shuttle. The telescope was nearly canceled several times in the '70s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like every Big Science project in recent memory, the telescope was oversold and underfinanced, and so its manufacturer, Perkin-Elmer, skipped an expensive and risky test that would have revealed that the telescope could not be focused because its main mirror was polished to the wrong shape. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of the telescope's launching in April 1990, 14 years after Congress approved it, it had cost $2 billion. The NASA public relations machine, which had been gearing up for years for that moment, called it ''the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, when the blur was discovered, the telescope was a national joke. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, who is a staunch space supporter from Maryland -- home of the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute -- called it a ''techno turkey.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a do-or-die 11-day mission in December 1993, spacewalking astronauts from the shuttle Endeavour corrected the vision of the telescope. Their achievment, which vindicated the idea of astronaut maintenance, and the construction of the space station, as well, was probably the high point of the space shuttle program. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, astronauts have visited the Hubble three more times, replacing the precious gyroscopes as they failed and installing a succession of more and more sensitive instruments, and the Hubble has gradually begun living up to its original hype. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has recorded the deepest telescopic image made, showing galaxies as they existed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. The instrument has shown the presence of monstrous black holes in the milky hearts of galaxies and discerned the first push of dark energy beginning to accelerate the universe five billion years ago. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this make the Hubble a more important instrument than the Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson, which Edwin Hubble used to discover the expansion of the universe, or the 200-inch Hale Telescope on Palomar Mountain, with which astronomers discovered quasars and began to gauge the scale and fate of the universe? I don't know. For sure, the Hubble is the first big space telescope and the first celebrity telescope of the Internet age. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of the Hubble and its amazing images, Sandra Faber, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said a few years ago, ''We're addicted.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, NASA's then administrator Daniel S. Goldin warned astronomers in 1999 to stop ''hugging Hubble,'' lest their affection and the expense of keeping it aloft and well interfered with developing new telescopes and new missions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public is also addicted, not least because of a group of astronomers known as the Hubble Heritage Project, who have applied artistic principles to process the Hubble images into romantic spacescapes. In the best of their work, like ''Pillars of Creation,'' showing star-forming clouds in the Eagle nebula, space takes on the majesty of Western landscapes by artists like Albert Bierstadt. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, the Hubble became the people's telescope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Keefe tried to walk away from the telescope two years ago, saying it was too risky to send astronauts anywhere but the space station. He later conceded to Steven Dick, a NASA historian, that he had never conducted a formal risk analysis. To Mr. O'Keefe's surprise, the public and Congress would not let him abandon the Hubble. Schoolchildren volunteered to send their pennies to NASA to help pay for a service mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's public relations machine had done its work too well. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Keefe then considered sending a robot to repair the Hubble, only to find that many astronomers were wary of a machine tending their telescope. They wanted astronauts, and the National Academy of Sciences concurred. The idea died, seemingly dooming the Hubble. But then Mr. O'Keefe stepped down a year and a half ago to become the chancellor at Louisiana State University. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin, who took over as administrator, is a real rocket scientist -- Mr. O'Keefe had been a business professor and management expert -- and had said from the beginning that he was willing to reconsider the fate of the telescope. But he has been under fire from the scientific community lately for his willingness to cut and delay science missions to finish the space station and start President Bush's Moon Mars program. In September in a typically blunt speech at the Goddard Space Center, Dr. Griffin scolded scientists for expecting to have too much of a say over what the space agency does, and even accused them of having a conflict of interest. Last week at the same center, however, the scientists gave him a standing ovation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, the Hubble has returned from the brink. At least one more time, the astronauts will return in their homely patched-up chariot. Like ghosts of a Christmas future that never quite jelled -- none of the three subsequent ''Great Observatories'' were designed for astronaut servicing -- the astronomer knights of the shuttle will ride the robot arm, lugging their Buck Rogers wrenches, and clamber up the shiny flanks of the telescope; they will literally hug the Hubble. </p>

If the shuttle runs into trouble, it won't be able to rendezvous with the International Space Station for help. The best it could do is collide with it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons have to do with physics and politics, which led the United States and Russia to set the orbits of the Hubble telescope and the space station at different angles to the Equator.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the physics. Decades ago, the United States built its main launching pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., almost as far south as possible, to make it easier for its space vehicles to achieve orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a rock thrown from a speeding car, a spacecraft launched from a low latitude gets a push from the earth's rotation -- 1,000 miles an hour at the Equator, tapering to zero at the poles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble was launched there in 1990 at an angle of 28.5 degrees from the Equator, the lowest angle easily achievable from Cape Canaveral. The minimum angle of orbit equals the latitude of the launch point, and Cape Canaveral is at 28.5 degrees north.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the politics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station was built in a historic partnership with the Russians. As part of the arrangement, the United States agreed that the station would orbit at an angle of 51.6 degrees from the equator. The orbit was chosen so that the Russians could launch components and crews from their site at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, at latitude 45.9 degrees north, to build and service the Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for the 11-day mission planned for 2008 is that the shuttle will have to be launched at an angle of 28.5 degrees to match the Hubble's orbit. Once the shuttle is launched, though, it will be all but impossible for the spacecraft to change its orbit to detour to the space station in the event of trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible for the shuttle to change its altitude to match the altitude of the space station. But a successful rendezvous would require the relative motion of the two spacecraft to be zero. And because the angles of their orbits are different, the two craft would cross paths at several miles per second. Disaster would ensue. MATTHEW L. WALD  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''IT'S ROCKET SCIENCE''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once an object is launched into orbit, changing the angle at which it crosses the Equator is very difficult. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched at 28.5 degrees, the easiest angle possible from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Launching at low angles minimizes the amount of rocket thrust needed to achieve orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station is at 51.6 degrees, the standard launch angle used by Russia at Baikonur, Kazakhstan.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency's finest scientific instrument escaped a death sentence yesterday when Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, approved a shuttle mission to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. It was a brave call, since repairing the Hubble will put the shuttle at greater risk than a typical mission to the International Space Station. It was also a welcome sign that NASA is willing to go the extra orbital mile to support superb science, even while it squanders large sums on completing the space station to perform research that can't begin to compare with the Hubble's in importance.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade and a half, the Hubble has made discoveries that have helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Its typical role is to pick up a hint from ground-based telescopes and then use its unparalleled vantage point above the atmosphere to probe deeply into some puzzling phenomenon. The Hubble has peered farther into space and farther back in time than any other instrument. It has discovered more than 500 proto-galaxies that emitted light when the universe was in its formative stages, confirmed the jaw-dropping discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and helped establish the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel of distinguished astronomers judged that the Hubble ''has arguably had a greater impact on astronomy than any instrument since the original astronomical telescope of Galileo.'' And what made all of this possible was NASA's willingness to refurbish the Hubble every few years to replace depleted batteries and gyroscopes and install new equipment. Many experts believe that when the Hubble gets two state-of-the-art instruments on the next servicing mission in 2008 it will be more capable than ever, ready to peer farther back into a time when galaxies were forming and the universe was emerging from darkness into light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat to the Hubble's future came unexpectedly from NASA itself in early 2004. In a decision that can only be described as myopic, Sean O'Keefe, the administrator at the time, unexpectedly canceled the next servicing mission, ostensibly because of safety concerns after the Columbia disaster. But the underlying reason was almost certainly that a Hubble mission would be a diversion from the administration's priorities to complete the space station and then send astronauts back to the Moon and eventually Mars. Only intervention by Congress and the National Academy of Sciences kept the death sentence at bay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Griffin has concluded that the mission can be conducted safely, especially since NASA has developed new inspection and orbital repair techniques, and that the mission will not interfere with other space priorities. A Hubble mission may be marginally more risky than a flight to the space station, but that risk is surely worth taking for the scientific payoff.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREENBELT, Md., Oct. 31 -- NASA announced Tuesday that it would send space shuttle astronauts in 2008 to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, extending the life of one of its most valuable spacecraft on a mission once thought too risky to try. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Announcing the decision here at the Goddard Space Flight Center, a Hubble command post, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said the benefits of saving the celebrated telescope were worth the risks of sending astronauts to do the job. </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-day mission, expected to cost about $900 million, is to lift off sometime between the spring and fall of 2008. A crew of seven, led by Scott D. Altman, who commanded the last Hubble repair mission in 2002, will capture the observatory in its 380-mile-high orbit and conduct five spacewalks to replace its aging batteries and stabilizing gyroscopes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the repairs, the telescope would die in orbit in two or three years. With them, it should continue operating until at least 2013. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While there is an inherent risk in all spaceflight activities,'' Dr. Griffin said, ''the desire to preserve a truly international asset like the Hubble Space Telescope makes doing this mission the right course of action.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His predecessor, Sean O'Keefe, provoked an outcry from scientists, politicians and the public in 2004 by canceling a scheduled fifth and final repair mission in the wake of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its crew. Mr. O'Keefe cited the risk to astronauts and the need to use the remaining shuttle flights to finish the International Space Station. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble telescope has been one of the most productive astronomical observatories ever built and the flagship of NASA's exploration of the universe. Orbiting far above Earth's obscuring atmosphere, it has sent back the clearest and deepest images of the universe ever seen. Those images have helped astronomers confirm the existence of black holes, determine the true age of the universe and spot dim galaxies born within the first billion years of the Big Bang. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to criticism of Mr. O'Keefe's decision, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration investigated using a robot to service the telescope. But a National Academy of Sciences advisory panel said that the chance of completing such a mission in time to save the observatory was remote and that a manned mission had a better chance of success. The committee also said the risks of a shuttle mission to the telescope were not significantly greater than those of a mission to the space station. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the station could serve as a refuge for the crew of a damaged shuttle. The telescope offers no such haven. So Dr. Griffin said that during the repair mission, a second shuttle would be ready to rescue the astronauts if needed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who led the fight in Congress to save the telescope, was at the announcement and praised the decision. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mikulski said the initial decision to abandon a repair mission was made at a time of grief, fear and indecision. She praised NASA for stepping back and getting a ''second opinion'' on canceling the mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. John M. Logsdon, head of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of a panel that investigated the Columbia accident, said the next repair mission should be safer than the previous four. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA is flying the shuttle with more care and has a greater capability to identify and fix problems than before,'' Dr. Logsdon said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger D. Launius, a historian with the National Air and Space Museum who closely follows NASA issues, said the decision could help improve Dr. Griffin's relations with scientists who have criticized him for reducing long-term spending on science programs to pay for new human space flight initiatives. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this case, he's shown a willingness to go to bat for science,'' Mr. Launius said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin worked on the space telescope earlier in his career and recently described it as ''one of the great scientific instruments of all time.'' Before his confirmation as NASA administrator a year and a half ago, he expressed a willingness to explore repairing the orbiting observatory, which is operated by the Goddard center and the Space Science Telescope Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two most serious issues facing the telescope are its batteries and gyroscopes. The gyroscopes help it turn and lock onto targets; the six batteries, which have never been replaced, keep it alive. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has flown three shuttle missions since the Columbia accident to test new safety modifications and resume building the space station, and agency officials said about a half dozen more flights would occur before the Hubble mission. Crews now routinely inspect the shuttle while in flight for the kind of damage that doomed the Columbia, and they carry rudimentary repair kits for fixing many heat shield problems that could bring down a shuttle. </p>
