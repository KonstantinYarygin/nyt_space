<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When space tourism finally takes off and the rich and famous head off for a holiday in orbit as easily as on the Riviera, they may want to sip something stronger than Tang as they gaze down at Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something like whisky, perhaps.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When they go on a bit of an adventure, it's the thing people want to take with them,'' said Peter Moore, the brand director for Ballantine's, a maker of blended Scotch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ballantine's is already looking ahead to that future, financing the development of a glass for sipping while floating in weightlessness, which it unveiled on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is about getting ourselves ready,'' Mr. Moore said. ''Space tourism is going to develop. Personally, I think it's going to develop quite quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without gravity, it is impossible to pour a liquid, and runaway droplets could splash in inconvenient places like electronic circuitry. For a glass that offered a refined drinking experience reminiscent to that on Earth required the manipulation of some counterintuitive principles of fluid dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom of the bulbous glass, made of gold-plated stainless steel, contains a spiral ring for a reservoir of whisky to cling to. Through a phenomenon known as capillary action, first observed by Leonardo da Vinci, the whisky is drawn upward through a helical channel within the side of the glass to a mouthpiece at the rim for a space traveler to drink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so magical how things behave when you take gravity away,'' said James Parr, founder of the Open Space Agency, an organization of space technology enthusiasts in London that designed the space glass for Ballantine's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, the downward drag of gravity overwhelms the capillary action. To test whether the design worked, Mr. Parr took the space glass to Bremen, Germany, to a 480-foot tall laboratory facility known as a drop tower. Whisky was poured into the bottom of the glass, which was then placed into a cylindrical capsule and winched to the top of a vacuum-sealed shaft. Dropping the capsule down the airless shaft creates nearly zero-gravity conditions for about four seconds, until it makes a cushioned landing at the bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the drop, video cameras recorded the motion of the whisky. ''The whisky started climbing up the capillary to the mouthpiece, and it happened completely to script,'' Mr. Parr said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Ballantine's master blender, Sandy Hyslop, created a special version with a sweeter, spicier taste to compensate for the muted sensory experiences that astronauts report in the weightlessness of orbit. Without gravity, water in an astronaut's body floats upward, and the result is congestion similar to a perpetual head cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither the whisky nor the glass will be a commercial product anytime soon. There is only one space glass in the world at present (two more, tweaked and improved, are being made), and just 11 bottles of the space blend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is whiskey currently zipping around the Earth on the International Space Station -- but only for the sake of science. In August, the Japanese conglomerate <span class="companylink">Suntory</span> sent up an experiment to test a hypothesis that aging liquor in a zero-gravity environment, in the absence of convection, would lead to a mellower final product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ardbeg, a Scotch whisky maker, sent up a similar experiment in 2011, which came back to Earth last year, to be analyzed for differences in taste and chemical make-up compared with samples that had been aged on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, opportunities for drinking whiskey, or any alcohol, in space are limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> packed spirits for its astronauts once -- brandy to celebrate Christmas during the Apollo 8 swing around the moon in 1968. But Frank Borman, the commander, ordered that the brandy remain unopened. (James Lovell later auctioned off his two-ounce bottle, still unopened.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, after Apollo 11 set down on the moon, Buzz Aldrin held a private Communion for himself with wine and bread. ''I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me,'' he wrote in an article published in the magazine Guideposts the following year. ''In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> added sherry to the menu for astronauts on the Skylab space station, but backtracked when letters of outrage arrived. Since then, prohibition has been the rule on <span class="companylink">NASA</span> missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians have had a more lax attitude to alcohol in space, at least during the era of the Mir space station. (In 1998, Jerry Linenger, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronaut on Mir, took a photograph of his Russian colleagues breaking out bottles of cognac to relax right after extinguishing a fire that almost destroyed Mir.) In recent years, they have been reticent about whether their astronauts are bringing spirits to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the space whisky glass could be used for any beverage. Mr. Parr said he had had preliminary talks with Made in Space, a company that sent a 3-D printer to the space station, to discuss the possibility of fabricating one of the glasses in space for more extensive testing by astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the beginning of the space age, astronauts have had to drink through straws out of plastic bags. Donald Pettit, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronaut, complained about that during a trip to the space station in 2008, which caught the attention of Mark Weislogel, a professor of materials and mechanical engineering at Portland State University in Oregon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Weislogel's research involves moving liquids in low gravity via capillary action without pumps, a principle used to shift fuel from tanks to engines, circulate coolant and process water. He emailed Dr. Pettit with a suggestion for a coffee cup that would work in weightlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pettit took a sheet of plastic and folded and taped it into the shape that Dr. Weislogel had suggested, with a teardrop-shaped cross-section like an aircraft wing, one side rounded and the other with a sharp fold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fluid flowed upward along the fold to the top of the cup where Dr. Pettit could sip it, and as he sipped, more fluid flowed up, allowing him to empty the cup. ''It's a result of surface tension and curvature of a surface,'' Dr. Weislogel said. ''The fluid seeks out the narrower region of the container.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a video of Dr. Pettit describing the invention:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Donald Pettit demostrating drinking coffee in space. Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He made several of them, and he toasted with a bunch of astronauts all drinking from these little things,'' Dr. Weislogel said. ''It was funny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, when he heard that the an espresso machine built by Lavazza, an Italian coffee company, and Argotec, an aerospace engineering firm, would be headed to the space station this year, Dr. Weislogel and his collaborators at IRPI, a small aerospace company, came up with a more carefully engineered version. It looks somewhat like a toddler's bootie, an odd shape that ''falls out of the mathematics,'' Dr. Weislogel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cup has been tested by astronauts on the space station with coffee, tea, juice and smoothies. ''It works very well,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ballantine's space glass grew out of brainstorming on how to innovate whiskey drinking for the 21st century. Initial ideas like a Bluetooth-connected whisky glass fell by the wayside. But when the idea of whisky in space was floated, ''There was a little bit of intake of breath,'' Mr. Moore recalled, ''and 'isn't that a little bit far out?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After view Ballantine's video describing the development work and the drop tests, Dr. Weislogel said, ''I think this is cool,'' but added, ''This container on its own will also have some problems.'' A bubble could form, blocking the channel and the flow of whisky, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Space Glass Project: The Microgravity Test Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the space glass is finished, Ballantine's will look to see what opportunities may exist in space tourism. (Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's company that aims to send people on short suborbital flights to the edge of space, has already partnered with Grey Goose, the vodka maker.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've created an artifact from the future,'' Mr. Parr said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $79 plus shipping, you can buy a reprint of a long-obsolete federal government publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The captivating title? ''<span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> Graphics Standards Manual.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may not be a page turner, but among certain design and space aficionados, it is a cherished piece of history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kickstarter campaign begun on Tuesday aims to raise $158,000 to finance a high-quality hardcover printing of this bureaucratic relic. In 1975, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> adopted a new logo, a minimalist twisting of letter forms that soon gained the nickname ''the worm.'' The standards manual, published a year later, prescribed how the space agency should deploy the logo across its publications, signs, aircraft, vehicles and spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a wonderful example of modernist design thinking that was prevalent in the '70s and the '60s,'' said Hamish Smyth, a designer at the firm Pentagram. ''To me as a designer, technically, it's pretty perfect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Smyth and Jesse Reed, also a Pentagram designer, undertook a similar effort to resurrect a 1970 standards manual for the New York City subways. That sign system, created by the renowned designers Massimo Vignelli and Bob Noorda, brought a measure of order and consistency to the trains and stations that largely persists today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obscure topic would most likely have made the book unappealing for a traditional publisher, so Mr. Reed and Mr. Smyth turned to Kickstarter. That enabled them to sell copies in advance to raise money for the production, and to know exactly how many copies to print. They set a goal of $108,000 for a minimum print run of 1,000 copies. ''We thought we were going to scrape through to get the minimum,'' Mr. Smyth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turned out, more than 6,700 people pledged $802,812. The 6,536 books were printed and distributed, and that, the designers thought, was the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people suggested other publications to revive. ''People would kind of keep on tweeting to us, 'You should do the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> one,' '' Mr. Reed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they emailed Richard Danne, the design director for NASA's 1970s graphics reinvention. Within hours, Mr. Danne said yes. (The material is in the public domain.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spring of 1974, a request for proposals for the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> redesign had landed at the office of Danne &amp; Blackburn, a firm that Mr. Danne had started with another designer, Bruce Blackburn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Endowment for the Arts</span> had started a program to encourage federal agencies to clean up and update their appearances and communications. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was one of the first in line to get a visual makeover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the U.S. agencies put out bad stuff,'' Mr. Danne said. ''No one had a clue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a small, young firm, it was an opportunity for attention, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was still basking in the glow of the Apollo moon landings. ''Even though the money in it was minuscule, we had to go for it,'' Mr. Danne said. ''We knew it was high profile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blackburn, who also designed the logo for the country's bicentennial celebration, set to work on a logo. Since 1959, the year after its founding, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had used what was affectionately called ''the meatball'' -- a blue circle filled with stars, a red swoosh that represents an airplane wing and a spacecraft orbiting the wing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The meatball was something that was contrived by jet pilots, and it went all the way back to Buck Rogers in terms of its sophistication,'' Mr. Blackburn said. ''It didn't look like a modern space agency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blackburn tried pictorial approaches, but concluded that the best embodiment of <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was its recognizable acronym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The linear treatment that would become the worm was a simplification of letter forms that embodied ''the technological base of the agency and had some future orientation as well,'' Mr. Blackburn said. ''It was extremely simple. It was direct.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the logo, the two A's lack crossbars, suggestive of a rocket nose cone or an engine nozzle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Danne presented it to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s leaders, they made sure to show how it would look ''applied to a lot of real things,'' Mr. Danne said. ''We knew in the presentation maybe it would be too abstract, too theoretical.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But James C. Fletcher, then <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s administrator, was skeptical about the missing crossbars. Mr. Danne recalled Dr. Fletcher saying, ''I just don't feel we are getting our money's worth!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blackburn said he had returned to the office and tried to make a more conventional A. ''You kill the baby when you do that,'' he said. ''They ultimately caved in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the graphics standards manual, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> began rolling out its new look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even a decade and a half later, many at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> still hated the logo -- too sterile, too much Spock and not enough Captain Kirk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in 1992, during a visit by Daniel S. Goldin, newly confirmed as NASA administrator, to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Langley Research Center in Virginia, the worm turned. Mr. Goldin recalled flying down to Langley with <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and White House officials. Paul Holloway, Langley's director, greeted him, and pointed to a hangar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He said to me, 'Do you see that?' '' Mr. Goldin said. ''I said, 'Yeah, that's the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> logo.' He said, 'That's the worm.' I said, 'The what?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Holloway then made a fateful pitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He said, 'If you want to really excite <span class="companylink">NASA</span> employees about changes coming, why don't you tell them we're going to deworm <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and bring back the meatball?' '' Mr. Goldin said. He turned to a White House official and asked if he was allowed to do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was, and in an address to Langley employees, Mr. Goldin announced that he was bringing back the meatball. ''And they went wild,'' he said. ''It was an incredible reaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, Danne &amp; Blackburn had dissolved after designing makeovers for federal agencies like the <span class="companylink">Department of Transportation</span>, the <span class="companylink">Army Corps of Engineers</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, word that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was discarding the worm and going back to the meatball ''was a pretty crushing thing,'' Mr. Danne said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change did not happen overnight. The worm logo remained on the space shuttles until they were refurbished beginning in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, carries it still. So does the first space shuttle, the Enterprise, now on exhibit at the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum</span> in New York. The Enterprise was used for glide tests but never went into space, and never received the updated markings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worm also lives on in Washington at the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> headquarters building, which opened in 1992, the year Mr. Goldin banished the logo. But it was already prominently carved in stone on the outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't know that,'' Mr. Blackburn said. ''Well, hallelujah. The good guys won one.''</p>

Ever since New Horizons beamed back those photos, the question has loomed: What's next?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We asked Times readers what <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s exploratory priority should be in the years ahead, and more than 1,600 shared their imaginative ideas. Here are a few of the responses, starting with the most popular. Read a larger selection of reader comments at nytimes.com/space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europa</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has been vocal about his choice for future space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to go ice fishing on these icy moons of Jupiter, especially Europa,'' he said, soon after the Pluto flyby. Nearly one-third of all the responses indicated a readiness for a mission to Europa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson and other scientists have long flirted with the idea that Jupiter's moons could harbor the ingredients necessary for life. Readers agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Europa has the right combination: Lots and lots of water, a cosmochemical abundance of other essential elements in its large rocky core, a liquid water ocean (covered by an icy crust) and a constant source of energy (tidal heating) operating over billions of years,'' wrote J. Gradie of Kailua, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These readers are in luck, sort of. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is working on a mission to Europa and is already budgeting tens of millions of dollars to plan multiple flybys of the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturn's Moons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enceladus and Titan, the two moons of Saturn, combined had the second-strongest constituency among Times readers for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s next priority. The Cassini mission to Saturn is beginning its goodbye tour after more than a decade of surveying the ringed planet and its moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many readers compared Europa and Enceladus and saw the latter as a better candidate for discovering life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ice cap is likely much thinner than on Europa, and the radiation environment is much more benign than Europa,'' wrote J. Kent Wallace of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, speaking on his own behalf. ''Traveling to Saturn takes more time than traveling to Jupiter, so it's not an easy choice. However, new technologies would allow us to directly detect microbial life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturn's largest moon, Titan, was also of great interest to many readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just imagine it -- flowing rivers and lakes of methane. Clouds dropping methane rain from the sky. Volcanoes spewing molten water which immediately hardens like lava on the ground. And in the sky there would be Saturn and its rings dominating,'' wrote Paul Fletcher of Kingston, Wash. ''Now on Titan you have the possibility of life based on a completely different chemical cycle and it would be right on the surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars, Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One out of every 10 readers who responded was intent on greater exploration of Mars than <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has already completed. A common theme among these readers was the fragility of life on Earth. With Mars, they argued, we might learn more about what fate our planet could face if it was not cared for, or create a backup in case our world was to become too far gone to save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Visiting Mars could be like visiting the Earth a billion years from now,'' wrote Jeff Ferrell of Portland, Ore. ''It could also offer relevant insight to Earth sciences, and even clues as to the inevitable geologic death of our own home planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the worry that we needed another home for humanity was concisely summarized by Lincoln Konkle of New Jersey, who wrote, ''Let's face it: we're wrecking the Earth's climate and environment, and not making much progress to change our ways, so we'd better explore whether we can create a backup.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars already has a prominent place in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s plans in the decades ahead. Beyond the current Curiosity rover's exploration of the planet, the Mars 2020 mission is a more concrete effort to land additional technology on the red planet. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and other space agencies also published a road map in 2013 that includes more extensive plans for exploring our sun's fourth satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our solar system's second planet does not receive a great deal of attention. A sense of cosmic injustice drove some of the interest in Venus, highlighted by one of the respondents who said it warranted greater exploration. ''It is really unfair to go for exploration of new horizons while we know less about our closest neighbor,'' wrote Sayyed Mohammad Abtahi of Sweden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Pieri of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, speaking for himself, argued for the feasibility of a visit to the planet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember the moon? You may see it every night and not take much interest in it, but a wide variety of Times readers wanted more from our planet's largest satellite. In some cases, the reasoning for focusing on the moon was purely practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we are trying to lay a foundation for space travel/exploration years and years from now, why not focus on what's right next door?'' asked Ken from New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Turner of Kansas City, Mo., made a plea that was every bit as passionate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Please do this in my lifetime. I'm 32,'' he wrote. ''I would love to say I've been to the moon and stayed at the Hilton Moon Inn and had Moons Over My Hammy at the Denny's there before I went outside for a moon walk.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern had always hoped to follow up the Pluto visit with another Kuiper belt object.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, on the 46th anniversary of the first moon landing, Yuri Milner, the Russian Internet entrepreneur and philanthropist, said he would spend $100 million over the next decade on the search for alien signals, known as SETI, giving the field a financial stability and access to telescopes it had never had. That same week, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> announced the discovery of what might be the most Earthlike planet yet beyond the solar system, Kepler 452b, a mere 1,400 light-years from here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference accompanying Mr. Milner's announcement, Geoffrey Marcy, a planet hunter from the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, noted that ''the universe is apparently bulging at the seams with ingredients for biology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he would bet Yuri Milner's house, reportedly also worth $100 million, that there is at least microbial life out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think the discovery of microbes on Mars or fish in the oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa would have scientists dancing in the streets. And you would probably be right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not everyone agrees that it would be such good news. For at least one prominent thinker, it would be a ''crushing blow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the <span class="companylink">University of Oxford</span> and director of the Future of Humanity Institute there, one of the great pessimists of this or any other age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an article published in Technology Review in 2008, Professor Bostrom declared that it would be a really bad sign for the future of humanity if we found even a microbe clinging to a rock on Mars. ''Dead rocks and lifeless sands would lift my spirit,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It goes back to a lunch in 1950 in Los Alamos, N.M., the birthplace of the atomic bomb. The subject was flying saucers and interstellar travel. The physicist Enrico Fermi blurted out a question that has become famous among astronomers: ''Where is everybody?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that there was no evidence outside supermarket tabloids that aliens had ever visited Earth convinced Fermi that interstellar travel was impossible. It would simply take too long to get anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument was expanded by scientists like Michael Hart and Frank Tipler, who concluded that extraterrestrial technological civilizations simply didn't exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logic is simple. Imagine that one million years from now Earthlings launch a robot to Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. It gets there in a few years, and a million years later sends off probes to two other star systems. A million years after that, each of those sends off two more probes. Even allowing for generous travel times, in 100 million years roughly a nonillion stars (10^30) could be visited. The galaxy contains maybe 200 billion stars, so each could be visited more than a trillion times in this robot crisscrossing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interstellar probe part of this is not so crazy, by the way. Serious people are already contemplating sending a probe to another star, using technology that could be achievable in the near future. See, for example, the <span class="companylink">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</span> and its 100-Year Starship Study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are billions of potentially habitable planets in the galaxy, moreover. If only a small fraction of these develop life and technology, that would be enough to turn the whole galaxy into Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milky Way is 10 billion years old. So where are those aliens or their artifacts? We've found zilch. If life is so easy, someone from somewhere must have come calling by now. This is known as the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many loopholes in this argument, including the possibility that we wouldn't sufficiently recognize alien life if it camped in our front yards. The simplest explanation, Dr. Bostrom and others say, is that there are no other spacefaring civilizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There must be something, he concludes, that either stops life from starting at all, or shuts it down before it can conquer the stars. He calls it the Great Filter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can imagine all kinds of bottlenecks in the evolution of life and civilization -- from the need for atoms to first combine into strands of RNA, the genetic molecule that plays Robin to DNA's Batman, to nuclear war, climate change or a mishap of genetic engineering -- that could constitute a Great Filter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question for Professor Bostrom is whether the Great Filter is in our past or our future, and for the answer he looks to the stars. If there is nothing else out there, then maybe we have survived whatever it is. As bizarre as it sounds, we are the first ones in the neighborhood to have run the cosmic obstacle course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is company out there, it means the Great Filter is ahead of us. We are doomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a staggeringly existential piece of knowledge to have obtained at what seems to be a tender age as a species, based on a cursory examination of a sliver of our cosmic neighborhood. It is also a truly brave exercise of the power of human reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe too brave. But there is a precedent of sorts in an old riddle known as Olbers' Paradox, after Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, a 19th-century amateur astronomer who enunciated a problem that had bothered some astronomers since the 16th century: Why is the sky dark at night? In an infinite eternal universe, every line of sight would end on a star, the thinking went, and even dust clouds would glow as bright as day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luminaries as disparate as the Scottish physicist Lord Kelvin and the writer Edgar Allan Poe suggested that the dark night sky was a clue to the fact that the universe is finite, at least in time, and had a beginning, a notion now cemented by the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Olbers saw the dawn of time, perhaps Fermi and Bostrom have seen the sunset. We should hardly be surprised. Nothing lasts forever. The fathers of SETI, Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, stressed that a key unknown element in their equations was the average lifetime of technological civilizations. Too short a lifetime would eliminate the possibility of overlapping civilizations. Forget about the mythical brotherhood of the galaxy. The Klingons left the building long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best we could have hoped for was to be another evolutionary phase in the zigzag development of earthly life on the way to who knows what. But in a few billion years, the sun will die, and so will the earth, and our descendants -- if they are still on it. The universe will not remember us or Shakespeare or Homer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can't really blame Professor Bostrom for that. But he has a history of disturbing thoughts. In 2003, he argued that we were probably all living in a computer simulation, something he said would be easy for ''technologically mature'' civilizations to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What his and other sci-fi-style calculations have in common is that they are extrapolations, of the doubling of chip capacity decreed by Moore's Law in the case of computer simulations, or the doubling of space probes over the eons. Believe them at your peril. Chips can't get smaller forever. Untended machines far, far from home break or forget why they are there. Apple can't keep doubling iPhone sales eternally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the great science writer and biologist Lewis Thomas liked to say, we are an ignorant species. This is why we do the experiment.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- A series of ultra-high-speed fiber-optic cables will weave a cluster of West Coast university laboratories and supercomputer centers into a network called the Pacific Research Platform as part of a five-year $5 million dollar grant from the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The network is meant to keep pace with the vast acceleration of data collection in fields such as physics, astronomy and genetics. It will not be directly connected to the Internet, but will make it possible to move data at speeds of 10 gigabits to 100 gigabits among 10 <span class="companylink">University of California</span> campuses and 10 other universities and research institutions in several states, tens or hundreds of times faster than is typical now.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge in moving large amounts of scientific data is that the open Internet is designed for transferring small amounts of data, like web pages, said Thomas A. DeFanti, a specialist in scientific visualization at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, or Calit2, at the <span class="companylink">University of California, San Diego</span>. While a conventional network connection might be rated at 10 gigabits per second, in practice scientists trying to transfer large amounts of data often find that the real rate is only a fraction of that capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new network will also serve as a model for future computer networks in the same way the original NSFnet, created in 1985 to link research institutions, eventually became part of the backbone for the Internet, said Larry Smarr, an astrophysicist who is director of Calit2 and the principal investigator for the new project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NSFnet connected five supercomputer centers with 56-kilobit modems. In the three decades since, network speeds have increased dramatically, but not nearly enough to handle a coming generation of computers capable of a quintillion operations per second. This week the Obama administration announced that the United States is committed to creating what is known as the ''exascale'' supercomputing era, with machines roughly 30 times faster than today's fastest computer, on what is called the ''petascale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe that this infrastructure will be for decades to come the kind of architecture by which you use petascale and exascale computers,'' Dr. Smarr said. Increasingly digital science is generating torrents of data. For example, an astronomy effort called the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, at the Palomar Observatory in Southern California, continuously scans the dark sky looking for new phenomena. Over all, the Palomar observational system captures roughly 30 terabytes of data per night. By contrast, a <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> project that archives the entire World Wide Web collects about 5 terabytes per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to moving data between laboratories, the high-speed network will make new kinds of distributed computing for scientific applications possible. For example, physicists working with data collected by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland initially kept duplicate copies of files at many different computer clusters around the world, said Frank Wuerthwein, a physicist at the <span class="companylink">University of California, San Diego</span>. More recently, he said, as high-speed links have become more widely available, experimental data is often kept in a single location and used for experiments by scientists running programs from remote locations, at a significant cost savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, the new network has been designed with hardware security features to protect it from the attacks that routinely bedevil computers connected to the Internet. Recently, one server at the <span class="companylink">University of California, San Diego</span>, that was connected to the open Internet counted 35,000 false login attempts in one day, said Dr. Smarr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new network is an extension of an existing intra-campus effort by the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span> to create islands of high-speed connectivity for campus researchers. In recent years the agency has invested more than $500,000 dollars on each of roughly 100 campuses nationwide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a planet a little more than one and a half times as big in radius as Earth. Known as Kepler 452b, it circles a sunlike star in an orbit that takes 385 days, just slightly longer than our own year, putting it firmly in the ''Goldilocks'' habitable zone where the temperatures are lukewarm and suitable for liquid water on the surface -- if it has a surface.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet's size puts it right on the edge between being rocky like Earth and being a fluffy gas ball like Neptune, according to studies of other such exoplanets. In an email, Jon Jenkins of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Ames Research Center, home of the Kepler project, and lead author of a paper being published in The Astronomical Journal, said the likelihood of the planet's being rocky was 50 percent to 62 percent, depending on uncertainties in the size of its home star. That would mean its mass is about five times that of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a planet would probably have a thick, cloudy atmosphere and active volcanoes, Dr. Jenkins said, and twice the gravity of Earth. Describing the planet during a news conference, Dr. Jenkins lapsed into lines from John Keats's poem ''On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer'': ''Then felt I like some watcher of the skies / When a new planet swims into his ken.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star that lights this planet's sky is about 1.5 billion years older than our sun and 20 percent more luminous, which has implications for the prospects of life, Dr. Jenkins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can think of Kepler-452b as an older, bigger cousin to Earth, providing an opportunity to understand and reflect upon Earth's evolving environment,'' he said. ''It's awe-inspiring to consider that this planet has spent six billion years in the habitable zone of its star, longer than Earth. That's substantial opportunity for life to arise, should all the necessary ingredients and conditions for life exist on this planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if any radio telescopes had pointed at the planet to try to detect extraterrestrial radio broadcasts, Dr. Jenkins said, ''I hope so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine whether Kepler 452b deserves a place on the honor roll of possible home worlds, however, astronomers have to measure its mass directly, which requires being close enough to observe the wobbling of its star as it is tugged around by the planet's gravity. For now, that is impossible, as Kepler 452b is 1,400 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is the first to be confirmed in a new list of candidates unveiled by Kepler astronomers on Thursday. It brings the number of possible planets discovered by Kepler to 4,696, many of them small like Earth. ''We are the bread crumbs of the universe,'' said Jeff Coughlin, of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., who compiled the catalog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, launched in 2009, spent four years staring at a patch of the Milky Way on the border between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by the passage of planets. Its pointing system failed in 2013, but astronomers are still analyzing the data Kepler collected. Every time they sift through it, new planets pop out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Kepler has switched to a different mode of observing in a mission called K2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NASA</span> news conference coincided with a major anniversary: It was only 20 years ago this fall that Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, of the <span class="companylink">University of Geneva</span>, discovered a planet circling the star 51 Pegasi, about 50 light-years from here. It was the first planet known to belong to a sunlike star outside our solar system, and its discovery ignited an astronomical revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Queloz, now at the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span> in England, said at the news conference, ''This is a great time we live in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we keep working so well and so enthusiastically,'' he went on, it is not too optimistic to think that in the future, ''the issue of life on another planet will be solved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers say they now know from Kepler that about 10 percent of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way have potentially habitable Earth-size planets, Kepler 452b probably among them. This means that of the 600 stars within 30 light-years of Earth, there are roughly 60 E.T.-class abodes, planets that could be inspected by a future generation of telescopes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif., is one of the companies that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is relying on to take cargo -- and, in a few years, astronauts -- to the space station. It had had a string of 18 successful flights for its Falcon 9 rocket, a remarkable success rate for a new rocket design.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on June 28, a Falcon 9 destined for the space station disintegrated less than three minutes after liftoff from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The rocket was carrying more than 4,000 pounds of supplies, equipment and experiments, including 30 from students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think to some degree, the company as a whole became maybe a little bit complacent,'' Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said Monday during a telephone news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Video of the launching suggested that the problem occurred in the midsection of the rocket, and that the first-stage engines continued to fire normally even as the rocket began to fall apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 0.893 seconds elapsed between the first indication of trouble and the last data sent back from the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering analysis indicated that the problem started with a metal strut, two feet long and one inch thick, that was holding down a helium bottle within the second-stage liquid oxygen tank. The strut failed at 2,000 pounds of force when it should have been able to withstand 10,000 pounds, Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unrestrained bottle broke free, releasing the helium inside, and the added pressure caused the oxygen tank to break apart, leading to the disintegration of the rocket, Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is somewhat speculative, but that's the best explanation we can think of right now,'' Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each Falcon 9 contains hundreds of such struts, and only after testing a large number of them did the company find a few that did not meet the requirements. Mr. Musk said the company would redesign the struts and in the future would individually test them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company would also take the time to review its production and operations to check for other issues that might have been ''near misses'' so far, even if they did not lead to disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dragon capsule on top of the rocket that was carrying the equipment and supplies fared better. It continued to send back its status until disappearing over the horizon. Had its parachutes deployed, it would have survived, Mr. Musk said, and in future launches, instructions to deploy parachutes in such circumstances will be added to its programming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next Falcon 9 flight will be no sooner than September, Mr. Musk said. The inaugural flight of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s much larger Falcon Heavy rocket will also be delayed, from later this year to next spring, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> mishap was the third loss of a cargo ship headed to the space station in the last year. A cargo rocket built by the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., exploded just after liftoff from a launching pad in Virginia in October, and a Russian supply ship in April spun out of control because of a problem with the rocket's upper stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Russian supply rocket successfully launched to the space station the week after the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> failure, and the astronauts on the space station have sufficient supplies for months. Three astronauts are set to launch to the space station on a Russian Soyuz rocket on Wednesday to bring the size of the crew back to six.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money for Breakthrough Listen, as Mr. Milner calls the effort, is one of the biggest chunks of cash ever proffered for the so far fruitless quest for cosmic companionship known as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI. It will allow astronomers to see the kinds of radar used for air traffic control from any of the closest 1,000 stars, and to detect a laser with the power output of a common 100-watt light bulb from the distance of the nearest stars, some four light-years away, according to Mr. Milner's team.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These could be propitious times for ET. The relentless improvement of electronics and computing power have made it possible to build receivers 50 times as sensitive as before, relieving astronomers of the need to guess what channels an extraterrestrial being might broadcast on. The astronomers can listen to all of them at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Kepler spacecraft and other hunters of planets circling distant stars have determined that there are billions of possible habitats for other beings in our galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Drake started it all in 1960 when he pointed a radio telescope at a pair of sunlike stars hoping to hear a ''hello.'' He heard nothing, which has pretty much characterized the effort ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No amount of cosmic silence, however, has been able to discourage astronomers who theorize that radio signals can bridge the gulfs between stars more cheaply than spacecraft, allowing distant species to communicate by a sort of cosmic ham radio or galactic Internet. And, they note, only a few thousand of the Milky Way's 200 billion stars have been sampled, on only a few of the billions of possible radio channels -- a minuscule piece of what they call the ''cosmic haystack.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple squeal or squawk, or an incomprehensible stream of numbers by a radio antenna pointed at one of those stars, would change history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a responsibility to not stop searching,'' Mr. Milner said in an interview. ''It should always be happening in the background. This is the biggest question. We should be listening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milner has recruited a small coterie of scientists to run the project. Among them are Martin Rees of <span class="companylink">Cambridge University</span>, Britain's astronomer royal, who will lead an advisory group; Peter Worden, former director of the NASA Ames Research Laboratory, home of the Kepler effort; Geoffrey Marcy of the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, a renowned exoplanet hunter; Dr. Werthimer; Andrew Siemion, also of Berkeley; and Ann Druyan, a co-author of both ''Cosmos'' television series and widow of the astronomer Carl Sagan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dr. Werthimer, about a third of Mr. Milner's money will go toward building new receiving equipment, and about a third will go toward hiring students and other astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest will be used to secure observing time. For now, that effort will include two of the largest radio telescopes in the world: the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Csiro Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both have had financial troubles in an era of flat budgets, and have been seeking partners to help keep the observatories running. Mr. Milner has agreed to underwrite 20 percent of the cost in return for 20 percent of the observing time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could never get enough telescope time,'' Dr. Drake recalled. ''Yuri can fix that with the click of a pen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Werthimer, who will oversee the analysis of data, said it would be open to all, including the nine million users of SETI@home, a free screen saver program that processes SETI data in the background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that any of this guarantees success. But, Mr. Milner said, ''it's not crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 10 or 20 years, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> could have telescopes in space that could determine the composition of a remote planet's atmosphere, he said. The presence of oxygen would be a smoking gun for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An advanced civilization may have already done that and targeted Earth, as a likely candidate for life, with a cosmic beacon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would any species do such a thing? Ask why we build pyramids or presidential libraries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Drake said his budget for the first radio search was $2,000. ''We've come a long way,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flyby of Pluto last week by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft is rightly celebrated as a triumph of human ingenuity, the capstone of a mission that unfolded nearly flawlessly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it almost did not happen, which would have left Pluto as just a hazy dot of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons overcame skeptical <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials, repeated threats to its funding, laboratory troubles that constricted the amount of plutonium available to power the spacecraft and an unforgiving deadline set by the clockwork of the planets. Though none of the obstacles packed the drama of space-exploration crises like the Apollo 13 mission, their number and magnitude seemed unbelievable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you wrote a novel about it, I don't think people would buy it,'' said S. Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of New Horizons, the little spacecraft that could, and did, visit a small planet that is now considered too small to be a planet, started 15 years ago when <span class="companylink">NASA</span> called it quits on Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade, concepts for sending a mission there had been studied but never done. In 2000, the price tag for the latest incarnation, called Pluto-Kuiper Express, appeared to be getting out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When it was canceled,'' Dr. Stern said, ''the associate administrator at the time, Ed Weiler, held a press conference and said: 'We're out of the Pluto business. It's over. It's dead. It's dead. It's dead.' He repeated himself three times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many planetary scientists and Pluto fans reacted in dismay, especially as it seemed to be a case of then or never.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto had reached the closest point of its orbit to the sun in 1989 and was on the outbound trek, turning colder. Scientists worried that Pluto's tenuous atmosphere would turn to ice and fall to the ground, making Pluto a much less interesting place to study until it neared the sun again -- two centuries later, when they would be long gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a second orbital consideration. The quickest way to Pluto is to take a left turn at Jupiter, using the giant planet's gravity for acceleration, which cuts the travel time by four years. But a launch after January 2006 would mean Jupiter would be too far out of alignment to provide a boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamatios Krimigis, then the head of the space department at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland and a member of a committee that advised <span class="companylink">NASA</span> on missions to the outer planets, recalled Dr. Weiler's asking him in the fall of 2000 whether it would be possible to do a low-cost Pluto mission similar to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft that the laboratory had built and operated for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> a few years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'Well, we can look at that,' '' Dr. Krimigis said in an interview. He was intrigued but uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Krimigis pulled together a small group who worked over the Thanksgiving holiday to come up with a cost estimate: $500 million including the rocket. That quick study sketched out a basic design that would turn into New Horizons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> put out a call for proposals, a competition to design a new Pluto mission that would arrive by 2015 and cost less than $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Johns Hopkins team knew how to build spacecraft, but the science of Pluto was not its expertise. For that, Dr. Krimigis reached out to Dr. Stern, the head of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s space studies department in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern was a member of the ''Pluto Underground,'' a dozen planetary scientists who in 1989 met in a Baltimore restaurant and discussed how to push <span class="companylink">NASA</span> toward a Pluto mission. Over the years, he had worked on various studies for Pluto missions, none of which had paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Stern, who rallied efforts to persuade <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to again consider a Pluto mission, liked what he heard from Dr. Krimigis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They discussed, compromised and then agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2001, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> chose New Horizons. ''We busted our butts, and we won it,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That started a four-year, two-month sprint to design, build and test the spacecraft and get it to the launching pad -- but almost immediately there was an obstacle. ''Two months later, the Bush administration canceled it,'' Dr. Stern said, laughing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's budget proposal for 2003 included no money for Pluto, the second year in a row that the administration had tried to kill such a mission. But Congress, persuaded by Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, inserted earmarks in the spending bills to keep the Pluto mission on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every year Congress had to keep us on life support,'' said Glen Fountain, New Horizons' project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> named Pluto a top priority for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s planetary science missions. ''At that point, you could feel things change,'' Mr. Fountain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers of spacecraft missions often talk about the trade-offs between cost, schedule and risk. Too quick and too cheap greatly raise the chance of failure. ''We don't believe in that,'' Dr. Krimigis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just seven instruments, the craft was about the size of a grand piano. Mr. Fountain said the philosophy at the Johns Hopkins laboratory is to stick to proven technologies and keep the design to the essentials, which reduce cost and avoid delays without increasing risk. The one compromise, he said, was a digital radio receiver that would consume less power. The Johns Hopkins laboratory had already started working on the technology in a separate project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't think it was a huge risk,'' Mr. Fountain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development continued without any showstoppers, although the cost rose to $722 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in August 2004, the Department of Energy informed the New Horizons team that it could not provide the plutonium power source. At the far reaches of the solar system, the sun is too dim for a spacecraft to rely on solar panels or batteries. Instead, a chunk of radioactive plutonium generates heat that is converted to electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security lapses and safety issues at the <span class="companylink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span> in New Mexico had shut down the production of plutonium dioxide pellets for New Horizons' power generator. Not enough had been made to provide the 220 watts called for in the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We said, 'How much power could you deliver?' '' Mr. Fountain said. The reply: 180 watts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of design decisions like the digital radio receiver, Mr. Fountain thought the reduced power would be sufficient. In the end, the Department of Energy was able to build a power generator that put out 200 watts during the flyby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons launched on top of an Atlas 5 rocket on Jan. 19, 2006, making the fastest-ever trip out of Earth's neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen months later, the craft was at Jupiter already, and the mission team put its instruments to the test. New Horizons captured time lapse pictures of a volcanic eruption on Io, one of Jupiter's four big moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just after the Jupiter flyby, New Horizons suffered its first computer glitch. For spacecraft outside Earth's protective atmosphere, high-energy cosmic rays occasionally zip through computer memory, causing a crash and restart. Calculations indicated that there would be one such crash during the nine-and-a-half-year trip to Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they occurred almost once a year. But none caused lasting damage, and they proved good learning experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was just eventful enough to keep us alert,'' said Christopher Hersman, the missions systems engineer. ''It actually helped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the long cruise was mostly uneventful. Flinging a spacecraft to a rendezvous at the edge of the solar system is indeed rocket science, but not groundbreaking rocket science. The equations -- the basic laws of Isaac Newton -- are the same ones that were used decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the engineers were careful with their calculations -- tiny errors can grow calamitous -- and periodic checkups made sure everything was working smoothly on the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on July 4, 10 days before the Pluto flyby, the spacecraft suddenly fell silent. Alice Bowman, the mission operations manager, said years of experience had given her a sense when a problem might be the fault of the receiving stations and when it might be a problem with a spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I pretty much knew it was something on the spacecraft,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She called Mr. Hersman. ''Where are you?'' she said, summoning him urgently to the missions operations center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an Independence Day barbecue with neighbors, Mr. Hersman was already on the way to the office anyway. ''Going in, I was thinking, 'Remain calm,' '' Mr. Hersman recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bowman called Mr. Fountain. He, too, headed in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thoughts of the worst popped into his mind: ''Could we have been so extremely unlucky that we hit something?'' Even debris the size of a grain of rice could destroy a delicate craft moving so fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it turned out the spacecraft's computer had overloaded trying to do two things at once -- receive instructions for the flyby while compressing images in its memory banks. By design, the main computer entered what engineers call ''safe'' mode to avoid damage to the spacecraft, and the backup computer kicked in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour and a half later, the ground stations detected the signal from the backup computer. ''Then I knew we could do it,'' Ms. Bowman said. ''The question was, could we do it in time?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nine-day sequence of commands to guide New Horizons through the flyby was set to begin on July 7. Ms. Bowman spent two nights at the office, taking only short naps. ''You would be amazed how much that can do,'' she said. ''I can't say I slept.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With hours to spare, the craft was back in operation. Then the flyby directions kicked in, and New Horizons did everything it was told to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 26, 2015, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the early travails of the New Horizons mission to Pluto referred incorrectly to the volcanic eruption on Jupiter's moon Io that the spacecraft observed in 2007. Erupting volcanoes on Io were seen during earlier <span class="companylink">NASA</span> missions; the New Horizons images were not the first. And because of an editing error, an accompanying picture caption misstated the date and location of a spin test of the spacecraft before its launching. The test shown took place in 2005 at the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, not in 2006 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I saw this image for the first time, I decided I was going to call it not-easy-to-explain terrain,'' said Jeffrey Moore, the leader of the geology, geophysics and imaging team for New Horizons, which visited Pluto this week. ''You can clearly see that we've discovered a vast craterless plain that has some strange story to tell.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a news conference on Friday, Dr. Moore and other mission scientists described some additional data that the spacecraft has sent back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been an ecstatic few days for the scientists, who are puzzling over features they never expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a little biased, but I think the solar system saved the best for last,'' said S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a journey of nine and a half years and three billion miles, New Horizons passed within 7,800 miles of Pluto's surface on Tuesday. It was traveling much too fast to enter orbit and instead zipped past. Pluto is already more than two million miles in its rearview mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the spacecraft finishes its observations at the end of the month, its onboard memory will be filled with 50 billion bits of data. Communications are slow over the interplanetary expanse, and only about 2 percent of the data has been sent back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first up-close snapshot released on Wednesday showed mountains as tall as 11,000 feet, made of water ice, not rock. One surprise was that there were no craters on this patch of Pluto, about 150 miles by 150 miles. (Craters have been spotted in the global view of Pluto, and other regions could be geologically much older.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new snapshot described by Dr. Moore on Friday was near the mountains and likewise devoid of craters, but it was almost flat. The lack of craters indicates that the surface was erased by erosion or tectonic activity in the recent geological past -- within the past 100 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This could be only a week old, for all we know,'' Dr. Moore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Moore speculated that the troughs, breaking the plains into irregular shapes 12 to 20 miles across, could be caused by convection of carbon monoxide, methane and nitrogen ices below the surface, ''creating the same sort of patterns that you see when you look at the surface of a boiling pot of oatmeal, or like the blobs in a lava lamp.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is that they could be similar to mud cracks on Earth, caused as the soil dries and contracts, Dr. Moore said. The shapes are reminiscent of those seen near the north pole on Mars, but it was too early to tell if similar geological processes had shaped them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the plains appeared pitted, as if suffering skin disease. Dr. Moore said it was not clear whether the pits actually exist or are just illusions inserted when the images were compressed. Clearer images without compression will be sent later. If the pits are real, they may have been caused by erosion when ice turns to vapor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, some of the troughs were partly filled with dark material, and others contained clusters of dark hills. The hills could be material that oozed out from below the surface, Dr. Moore said, or they could be knobs of more resilient material that persisted as the surrounding icescape eroded. The scientists have informally named the plains Sputnik Planum, in honor of the first space satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the mountains and the plains are part of a large, bright heart-shaped feature on Pluto that the scientists are calling Tombaugh Regio, after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An instrument that can identify certain molecules has found a concentration of frozen carbon monoxide in the western half of the heart, but not the eastern part or anywhere else on this side of Pluto. ''It's a very special place on the planet,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists also reported that New Horizons detected charged nitrogen atoms that had once been part of Pluto's atmosphere tens of thousands of miles away, carried away by the solar wind. With the weak gravity, computer models suggest that Pluto is losing 500 tons of its atmosphere every hour, far more than the one ton an hour that Mars loses. That raises the question of how Pluto still has an atmosphere at all.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was something wonderfully childlike in the delight of scientists and the public at the rendezvous of the New Horizons spacecraft with that most distant and mysterious of the planets, Pluto, even if it was reclassified a few years ago as merely a ''dwarf'' planet. But there was nothing childish in the extraordinary science and engineering required to send half a ton of highly sophisticated instruments hurtling through space at speeds of up to 47,000 miles an hour for three billion miles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whoops at the operations center at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory on Tuesday at the moment when the probe shot past Pluto, and the cheers when the spacecraft broke silence many hours later to confirm that it had survived the passage, spoke to an elemental curiosity in every human being, one awakened when a child first gazes out into a star-filled sky. That is ultimately what the mission was all about, as the celebrated British cosmologist Stephen Hawking declared in a message broadcast on <span class="companylink">NASA</span> TV: ''We explore because we are human and we want to know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the scientists who launched New Horizons nine and a half years ago, there was a distinctly parental anxiety in the hours after it went silent on Monday so it could dedicate all its energies -- a mere 200 watts -- to taking pictures and measurements of the icy body. ''We always talk about the spacecraft as being a child, maybe a teenager,'' explained Alice Bowman, the operations manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a storybook quality to the entire mission. Perched at the edge of the solar system in a thicket of small frozen objects known as the Kuiper belt, Pluto was only discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, a self-taught astronomer, a pinch of whose ashes were on board New Horizons, and named by an 11-year-old English girl, Venetia Burney, after the Roman god of the underworld. Once the spacecraft began sending clear pictures, scientists started naming various features on Pluto after fictional underworld characters ranging from the Balrog, a creature in J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' to Meng-Po, the goddess of forgetfulness in Chinese mythology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flyby is justifiably a source of great pride for the United States, which has now sent probes to all eight planets and the reclassified Pluto, fulfilling the ambitious challenge proclaimed by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961, when he called on Congress to approve funding for a mission to the Moon and ''perhaps to the very end of the solar system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major motive then was to demonstrate the supremacy of Western freedoms over Soviet tyranny. The Cold War is over, and the end of the solar system has been reached. But that cannot be the end of space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What next? Scientists, of course, are full of ideas, from further probes into our solar system to a search for planets beyond (readers can vote their preferences here). Whatever the choice, there need not be any commercial or ideological justification. The human impulse to know is more than enough.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAUREL, Md. -- The first close-up image of Pluto has revealed mountains as tall as the Rockies, and an absence of craters -- discoveries that, to their delight, baffled scientists working on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons mission and provided punctuation for a journey nine and a half years in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 112 years after the Wright Brothers were barely able to get their airplane off the ground, a machine from Earth has crossed the solar system to a small, icy world three billion miles away. The flyby on Tuesday, when New Horizons buzzed within 7,800 miles of the former ninth planet, came 50 years to the day after <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mariner 4 spacecraft made a similar first pass by Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto until a few weeks ago was a blurry dot. Within the past couple of days, it has been transformed into a dynamic world with varied geography, discoveries that point to the possibility of ice volcanoes and churning tectonics. All of this new information could provide clues to how planets form and even to the origins of some of the building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think any one of us could have imagined that this could have been a better toy store,'' S. Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, said during a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Grundy, an investigator working to analyze the surface composition of Pluto, chimed in: ''This is what we came for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This exceeds what we came for,'' added Catherine Olkin, the deputy project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, New Horizons had sent back the first batch of a bountiful trove of data that it had collected during its close flyby of Pluto. Dr. Stern said the rooms where teams got their first look at the images were ''something close to bedlam.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day before, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had released a mesmerizing image of the full 1,472-mile-wide disc of Pluto, highlighted by a bright heart-shaped swath of terrain. The newer image focused on a much smaller patch, about 150 miles across, near the bottom of the heart shape, and captured features as small as a half-mile across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first surprise was the rugged topography -- mountains up to 11,000 feet high. But these mountains are almost certainly made of frozen water instead of rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There may be higher ones elsewhere,'' said John Spencer, an investigator on the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a surprise because observations of Pluto from Earth have not found any signs of water ice. Frozen nitrogen and methane have been detected, but those ices are too weak to be bent and lifted into mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons took measurements that should be able to confirm that the mountains are frozen water, but that data remains on the spacecraft, to stream back over the next year and a half. Dr. Stern, however, had no doubt. ''We can be very sure that water is there in great abundance,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second surprise was that the dwarf planet's surface was unmarred by craters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have not yet found a single impact crater in this image,'' Dr. Spencer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collisions happen everywhere in the solar system. Planetary astronomers count craters to determine whether a surface is ancient, formed billions of years ago and then pockmarked by impact craters over the eons, or young, a smooth expanse that formed more recently, erasing the impact craters. Dr. Spencer said that the lack of craters suggested that this part of Pluto's surface was less than 100 million years old, extremely young given that the solar system is 4.5 billion years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather and tectonics can erase craters, but both require heat to stir things up. And Pluto, small and far away, possesses no obvious sources of heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For moons of giant planets, the heat can come from tidal forces squeezing the moon, but the tidal forces between Pluto and Charon are small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to get a little more clever,'' Dr. Spencer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other aspects of the surface were so unusual that he found it difficult to describe them in geological terms. When asked about perplexing features in the lower right part of the image, he stumbled and said, ''It's like piles of stuff with grooves on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Spencer also announced that the team had decided to informally name the heart feature Tombaugh Regio, after Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930. (Regio is Latin for ''region.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday night, celebrating the success of the flyby, members of the mission team held up a large poster of a stamp that the <span class="companylink">United States Postal Service</span> issued in 1991: ''Pluto: Not Yet Explored.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The words ''Not'' and ''Yet'' were crossed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is truly a hallmark in human history,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s associate administrator for the science mission directorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than capturing a close-up of Pluto, the mission is opening the door to a new neighborhood of the solar system that is bigger and stranger than the solar system that astronomers thought they had cataloged by the 1990s. Back then, the roster of planets memorized by schoolchildren ended with Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Pluto, New Horizons is now speeding into the Kuiper belt, which extends a couple of billion miles beyond Pluto and likely contains billions of icy worlds, including one, Eris, that is slightly smaller than Pluto yet more massive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kuiper belt objects are remnants of the earliest building blocks of the solar system, too far apart and too sparse to coalesce to a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, these small worlds are not bland as once thought. Pluto's largest moon, Charon, also surprised scientists. The light and dark areas seen from Earth had pointed to some intriguing possibilities on Pluto, but Charon is smaller and thought to be largely inert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Originally, I thought Charon might be an ancient terrain covered in craters,'' said Dr. Olkin, the deputy project scientist. ''Charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craters there are also few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The image provided a clearer look at the dark region at Charon's north pole. ''Informally, we've been referring to it as Mordor,'' said Dr. Olkin, referring to the fictional realm of the evil lord Sauron in J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Olkin said some small bright craters suggest that the dark color is just a thin veneer on top of other ices. In another region, the picture revealed a series of cliffs and troughs extending 600 miles across. There was also a canyon four to six miles deep, surprising for a body less than 800 miles wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is so much interesting science in this one image alone,'' Dr. Olkin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Dr. Spencer, Dr. Olkin was at times at a loss for words to explain what she was seeing. ''We are going to have to put our thinking caps on,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Hydra, one of the small moons, proved interesting. New Horizons's picture of it spanned only a few pixels, but Harold Weaver, the project scientist, pointed out that until a few weeks ago, this was the resolution that could be seen of Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the scientists finally have a good measurement of its size and shape, 28 miles long and 19 miles wide. Hydra is also reflective, bouncing back 45 percent of the light that hits it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That can only mean Hydra's surface is composed primarily of water ice,'' Dr. Weaver said. ''It's the only way to get it that bright. That's cool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons reported that it was in perfect health, with no problems cropping up during the flyby, and that it had gathered all of the scientific data it was supposed to. But with the slow communication rate from a 12-watt transmitter three billion miles away, it will take 16 months before scientists can examine all of that information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission scientists hope that New Horizons is far from done, that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> will grant it an extension to take a look at one of two small Kuiper belt objects close to its trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decision on the next destination is expected in August, and the spacecraft would adjust its course in late October and early November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a feat of Einsteinian navigation, they caught up, four and a half hours later, with a spacecraft named New Horizons that was speeding past Pluto at 30,000 miles per hour and was ready to phone home. The craft had just slipped into the shadow of the dwarf planet and turned around to look back at the Earth through Pluto's atmosphere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be left to historians of future decades to decide whether President Obama made the right choice in deciding to talk to his enemies rather than to bomb them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Pluto, history will have an easier task. Everybody alive on Earth was ready for some good news. It was easy to fall in love with Alice Bowman, the mission operations manager -- a.k.a. ''Mom'' -- for New Horizons, who spoke about the spacecraft as one would a child gone off to college as she calmly took an inventory of its systems when it finally made contact. The spacecraft had been taught well and was thriving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, it was possible to say in that moment, wasscience. A decade of missed sleep, holidays and family time, a great adventure in persistence, ingenuity and vision had paid off in data that would keep coming down for the next year and a half. Not only will the information provide a better view of Pluto's ''heart,'' but perhaps clues to the origin of the planets and solar system, frozen and stored all these eons out there in the ice cube tray of the gods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the audience at a news conference here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where the spacecraft was built and operated, were a handful of children, Plutokids, born on the day New Horizons was launched: Jan. 19, 2006. Invited to ask a question, one 9-year-old asked about the mission of New Horizons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a good question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well, New Horizons will continue traveling outward to encounter other denizens of the Kuiper belt, the vast zone of icy wreckage beyond the known planets. But the larger question is what this generation of Plutokids and their peers can look forward to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this trip to Pluto, S. Alan Stern, the leader of New Horizons mission, said, humans have now visited all the known worlds, the starry crib into which we were born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Sanford Nye, better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, the chief executive of the Planetary Society, offered his own view. Lacking the will or the resources or the patience to launch an interstellar probe to, say, Alpha Centauri, a star 4.5 light-years and a human lifetime away (assuming we could achieve a tenth the speed of light, which is about 20,000 times the speed of New Horizons), Mr. Nye said it might behoove us to look again at our origins and see them for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he agreed with Dr. Stern that New Horizons was the ''capstone'' of our reconnaissance of the solar system, Mr. Nye said he preferred to think of the Pluto flyby as having kick-started a new phase of exploration, a search for the end of cosmic loneliness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really want to find life,'' he said. ''Because if we find life, it would change the course of human history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are many possible venues in which we might find cosmic companionship, in the form of microbes or better: the ocean under the ice of Europa; the warm, salty geysers spitting from the Saturnian moon Enceladus; and underneath the ever-beckoning sands of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be, especially in the case of Mars, that we find out we are too late, and our putative cousins have already gone extinct. Or we might find out that we are they, blown from one formerly Edenic rock to another by a primordial asteroid blast. We might find out we know nothing about the various forms life might take and won't even recognize our new friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know from the Kepler spacecraft, another instance of technology, grit and vision that took years to reach fruition, that the Milky Way probably contains billions of potentially habitable planets. What are the odds that life evolves? John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut and the head of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s space science directorate, mused here recently: If the odds are a million to one, that still leaves thousands of chances. If they are higher? Nobody knows, but perhaps we will learn -- an effort that could easily take a generation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On schedule, at 8:52:37 p.m. Eastern time, a message from the spacecraft arrived at Mission Control here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a few moments later, when she confirmed that data was coming down, cheers erupted on Tuesday for the second time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, communications from New Horizons ended at 11:17 p.m. the night before, and as planned, the craft remained out of contact for almost 22 hours as it took pictures and collected bountiful other measurements of Pluto and its five moons. The design of the spacecraft did not allow it to perform its observations while communicating with Earth, and the mission team wanted to squeeze in as much work as possible as New Horizons flew within 7,800 miles of the former ninth planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference a half an hour later, Ms. Bowman said that everything appeared to have gone smoothly. ''We didn't have any autonomy rule firings,'' she said, referring to actions the spacecraft takes when something goes wrong. ''And what that means, in layman terms, is that the spacecraft was happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first round of cheers came Tuesday morning, as a countdown clock for the closest Pluto approach, as calculated by mission scientists, ticked down to zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was like New Year's Eve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to do our 10-9-8 thing, and you can get your flags out,'' S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons mission to Pluto, told the people gathered for the occasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to go absolutely ape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day climaxed a decade and a half of dreams and effort. Launched in 2006, New Horizons had traveled nine and a half years and three billion miles for a close encounter that was largely completed within hours. And yet that quick reconnaissance of Pluto has transformed what had been a fuzzy dot since it was discovered 85 years ago into a richly textured world, providing insight into the beginnings of the solar system and raw material for new mysteries that astronomers will ponder for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 7:50 a.m., the crowd, which included the children of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930, cheered -- albeit 72 seconds late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons had already begun speeding away from Pluto at 31,000 miles per hour. The latest calculations by the spacecraft navigators indicated that New Horizons would arrive at the closest approach 72 seconds ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the path of New Horizons was within the margins that the mission team had aimed for, and to avoid the risk of causing a problem with unnecessary tinkering, no updated commands to tweak the timing had been sent to the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were close enough,'' said Christopher B. Hersman, the mission's systems engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As everyone cheered, no one knew how the spacecraft, in the midst of 22 hours of automated science operations, was faring. And there was a chance, however small, that it was not faring well: A wayward piece of debris, for instance, could destroy the craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So scientists were left to wait and wonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We always talk about the spacecraft as being a child, maybe a teenager,'' Ms. Bowman said during a news conference after the flyby. ''There was absolutely nothing anybody on the operations team could do, just to trust that we had prepared it well to set off on its journey on its own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> released the newest color image of Pluto, which was sent down Monday and offers the clearest view yet of an icy world with a Mars-like reddish tint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can see regions of various kinds of brightness,'' Dr. Stern said during the news conference. ''Very dark regions near the Equator, very bright regions just to the north of that, broad intermediate zones over the pole. What we know is on the surface we see a history of impacts. We see a history of surface activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there appeared to be about five regions of distinct terrain, and even a prominent bright feature in the shape of a heart appeared to show clear differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a version of the picture in which colors had been exaggerated to show various features, Pluto looked as if a preschooler had smeared finger paints all over it. ''This is just a very psychedelic image,'' said Catherine Olkin, the deputy project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From telescope observations on Earth, astronomers have known for decades of a bright spot on this side of Pluto, and the New Horizons trajectory was chosen in part so it would see the spot in sunlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spacecraft approached, the bright spot resolved into that heart shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the image with the exaggerated colors, the right side of the heart is distinctly bluer than the pale yellowish left side, with a sharp boundary between the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annette Tombaugh, Clyde Tombaugh's daughter, talked about what her father, who died in 1997, would have thought of the probe's Pluto revelations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He would have said, 'That's a pretty neat heart,' '' Ms. Tombaugh said. ''If he were here, he would be on the team learning along with everybody else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists also had a closer look at the dark splotches that circle Pluto's Equator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional data from other instruments to identify some of the chemical makeup of the surface and map the range of temperatures will help the researchers figure out the nature of such features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Pluto is the Roman god of the underworld, the scientists drew on underworld entities from myths and literature in beginning to assign informal names to the regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large splotch that resembles a whale was named Cthulhu, a deity from a H. P. Lovecraft story. Other splotch names included Meng-Po, the goddess of forgetfulness in Chinese mythology; Balrog, a creature in J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' books; and Vucub Came and Hun Came, death gods of Mayan mythology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got tired of calling it the dark spot on the left and the dark spot on the right,'' said Jeffrey M. Moore, the leader of the geology, geophysics and imaging team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Wednesday, the spacecraft will be mostly finished with the data-collecting phase of the mission and will begin sending back a trove of data for scientists to ponder. In the morning, the first batch of data will arrive on Earth, including sharper images of Pluto -- 10 times the resolution of the image released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of Tuesday night's news conference, John Grunsfeld, the associate administrator for NASA's science directorate, pointed to a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> posting by President Obama on his phone:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto just had its first visitor! Thanks @NASA - it's a great day for discovery and American leadership. pic.twitter.com/FfztBSMbK0 -- President Obama (@POTUS) July 15, 2015</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld then turned to Dr. Stern, Ms. Bowman and Glen Fountain, the project manager. ''Get some well-deserved rest,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said, ''until 5 o'clock tomorrow morning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The room erupted with laughter and applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 16, 2015, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons mission to explore Pluto and the icy region of space beyond it misspelled the name of the H.P. Lovecraft deity for which a splotchy feature on Pluto that resembles a whale was named. It is Cthulhu, not Cthulu.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAKE TEKAPO, New Zealand -- TWENTY-FOUR hours before showtime our prospects looked bleak. Halfway around the world from our homes in Massachusetts, our team of astronomers had traveled to this lake's barren shores for a two-minute encounter with Pluto. But the wind was at gale force, so we weren't even allowed to open the telescope dome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As luck would have it, the next night -- the small hours of June 30 in New Zealand -- the wind died down, the sky was free of clouds, and the 1,500-mile-wide shadow of Pluto fell upon Earth, cast by a star trillions of miles away and in precise line with the Mount John Observatory. It was just as we had hoped.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our team -- scientists and students from Williams College, M.I.T. and <span class="companylink">Lowell Observatory</span> -- had won a gamble only astronomers would have made: placing bets, months in advance, on good weather over one remote spot on Earth for two minutes on the calendar. Only under those conditions could we use Earthbound telescopes to study starlight filtering through Pluto's atmosphere as the planet obscured (we say occulted) a star millions of miles behind it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had done this before, but this occasion was special. The occultation kicked off a two-week period that promises to change forever the way we see Pluto, perhaps the most mysterious body in our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, we astronomers are anticipating humanity's first up-close look at Pluto, during a flyby by the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> spacecraft New Horizons, which was launched in 2006. More than four billion miles from Earth, Pluto was discovered only 85 years ago, and is so small it was eventually reclassified to be the chief ''dwarf planet,'' rather than a minuscule ninth planet, in our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, studying an occultation, with its risks of failure, has been among the few good methods to learn about this celestial body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if all goes well, when New Horizons passes Pluto on Tuesday about 8 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, one of its cameras could capture details of Pluto's surface as clearly as a satellite photo shows a lake in Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We hope such images will finally tell us how big Pluto really is. Observations made from Earth already tell us that Pluto's atmosphere is too thick for us to judge from afar where the dwarf planet's solid mass ends and its atmosphere begins. Even images from the Hubble Space Telescope have been too fuzzy to tell Pluto's size accurately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, though, it is Pluto's atmosphere that has provided some of the best clues so far about what the dwarf planet may be like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider one discovery during an occultation a dozen years ago: We knew Pluto took 248 Earth years to circle the sun in a huge elliptical orbit, and it had passed the orbit's closest point to the sun in 1989. By 2002, we were assuming Pluto had been cooling ever since. Some computer models even predicted that its atmosphere would have disappeared, having fallen as snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its passage in front of a star told us otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Pluto had no atmosphere, we had reasoned, the starlight would wink out instantly when Pluto passed. Instead, it faded over several seconds, a clear sign that an atmosphere had survived. There were signs, as well, that it had warmed a bit and increased in pressure. This told us that Pluto experiences temperature lags, as does Earth. (The warmest point of an ordinary day in New York City occurs at 3 or 4 p.m., rather than noon.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such observations can have practical implications. For example, Pluto's atmosphere, like Earth's, is mostly nitrogen. Methane and other ice deposits on Pluto's surface can change into gas as sunlight hits them. So studying how those gases change Pluto's atmosphere over time may help us refine computer models used to study our own atmosphere, and the role played by gases like carbon dioxide when released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with New Horizons in range of Pluto, we can anticipate strikingly detailed revelations that may clarify our deductions. We wonder whether Pluto's surface will look like our Arctic. We want a close look at its five known moons. Whatever the imaging shows, we expect a new visual world to comprehend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have expected a few preliminary pictures of wonderful, if limited, quality as the spacecraft approaches Pluto. But then come dangers: The craft must pass undamaged through the plane of Pluto's moons, and it might collide with the space dust that orbits Pluto. We won't be sure it has reached its destination above Pluto for hours after it does so; only after 12 hours of examining the dwarf planet will it be turned to point its antenna toward Earth to send data, and those signals will take four and a half hours to reach Earth. And because so much data must travel so far, it will be 16 months before we have received all of its highest-resolution images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even then, those pictures will not replace the need to monitor Pluto from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New Horizons' view of Pluto will be intimate, it will be just a snapshot of a single visit. So it must be read in the context of time passing -- what we have learned and will continue to learn from much more distant observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this month, the realm of Pluto and its moons has been too far away to ever observe it from Earth with the detail we would like to have. That is now changing. And if we can draw conclusions from Pluto's shadow in starlight about how bodies in orbit warm (or cool), just imagine how much further we can now go with more close-up probes and ever more sophisticated long-range observations, as we seek insight about our own rapidly warming home planet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nine and a half years and three billion miles, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft was on course to take the first close-up look at Pluto on Tuesday morning.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fasten your seatbelts,'' S. Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, said Monday at a news conference here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, which is operating the mission. ''New Horizons is arriving at the Pluto system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the science findings so far: a precise measurement of Pluto's diameter; greater than expected amounts of nitrogen leaking from the atmosphere into space; confirmation of nitrogen and methane ices at the polar region; and images that show strange, and different, landscapes on Pluto and Charon, its largest moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pluto has not disappointed,'' Dr. Stern said. He described the data so far as ''mouthwatering,'' but said it was still too early to answer some of the mysteries, like the strange features of Pluto and Charon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Schenk, a co-investigator on the science team, said, ''It looks like somebody painted it for a 'Star Trek' episode.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto and Charon coalesced out of the same material after two large objects in the Kuiper belt -- the ring of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune -- collided early in the history of the solar system. But the two look very different, according to fuzzy images that New Horizons took from millions of miles away. The north pole of Charon is unexpectedly dark, while Pluto's is bright with ice. By contrast, Pluto has a belt of dark regions around its equator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With much better data arriving soon, the scientists were reluctant to speculate. ''We don't know,'' Dr. Schenk said several times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons, launched in 2006 aboard the biggest Atlas 5 rocket available, left Earth's vicinity at the highest speeds ever. The compact spacecraft, about the size of a grand piano, runs on just 200 watts of power, generated from the heat of 24 pounds of radioactive plutonium dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, New Horizons was still 650,000 miles from Pluto. Its closest approach to the former ninth planet, about 7,800 miles above the surface, was scheduled to occur Tuesday around 7:50 a.m. Eastern time. Dr. Stern said the resolution of the images would jump by more than a factor of 100, from 15 kilometers per pixel to less than 100 meters per pixel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The photos so far have been sharp enough to give a better determination of Pluto's girth -- 1,472 miles, give or take six miles -- which restores Pluto as the undisputed giant of the Kuiper belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery in 2005 of Eris, a more distant Kuiper belt object, set off the events that led to Pluto's demotion to dwarf planet, a new category. Eris was so bright that it seemed certain to be bigger than Pluto, and initial measurements appeared to confirm that. But later, astronomers were able to make a more precise measurement when a star passed behind Eris. Eris turned out to be 1,453 miles in diameter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar measurements had been made for Pluto, but the uncertainties were greater -- earlier estimates of the diameter ranged from 1,428 miles to 1,490 miles -- because Pluto has an atmosphere that bends starlight. Pluto and Eris appeared almost identical in size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With New Horizons weighing in, ''that settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger diameter means that Pluto is less dense than had been thought, and that in turn means a greater proportion of ice and less rock in its composition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Pluto is now the biggest in the Kuiper belt, Eris remains the heavyweight -- 27 percent more massive than Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists had expected to find that the atmosphere on Pluto was escaping into space, but New Horizons detected the charged nitrogen atoms last week, ''much farther from Pluto than we anticipated,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that could mean that the flow of nitrogen off Pluto is greater than had been thought or that the flow of charged nitrogen atoms happened to be concentrated in the region that New Horizons is traveling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers said New Horizons was operating perfectly, and they passed on their last opportunities to refine the trajectory or computer commands. ''We are good to go this last bit of this trip,'' said Glen Fountain, the project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 11:17 p.m. Monday, the spacecraft, by design, was to stop talking to Earth and start almost 22 hours of programmed choreography, repeatedly firing its thrusters to pivot among Pluto, Charon and four smaller moons, taking a multitude of measurements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the closest approach to Pluto, the trajectory is to pass through the shadows of both Pluto and Charon, which will enable additional measurements. A 70-meter radio dish in California will send a powerful signal toward Pluto. The signal will bend around Pluto, and then Charon, to the receiver on the spacecraft, providing information about Pluto's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those 22 hours, no one will know the fate of New Horizons. There is a chance -- tiny, but greater than zero -- that New Horizons could run into something as small as a pebble and come to a catastrophic end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it does not, the spacecraft will turn its antenna back toward Earth around 4:20 p.m. to send a message that it survived and a brief summary of how the day went. Four and a half hours later, the time it takes light to travel three billion miles, the message will arrive at mission control, around 8:53 p.m. ''That's going to be a very highly anticipated event,'' Dr. Stern said. ''I think we're all going to breathe a final sigh of relief at 9 p.m.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many on the mission team have long dreamed of this Pluto visit. New Horizons rose out of the ashes of an earlier mission, Pluto-Kuiper Express, which was canceled in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It always seemed the encounter was so far away,'' Dr. Stern said. ''People talk about how surreal it is that we're actually here.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what they termed ''a call to arms,'' an organization of American university astronomers said last week that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> should begin planning now to launch a sort of supersize version of the Hubble Space Telescope in the 2030s to look for life beyond Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This High Definition Space Telescope would be five times as big and 100 times as sensitive as the Hubble, with a mirror nearly 40 feet in diameter, and would orbit the sun about a million miles from Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a telescope, the astronomers said, would be big enough to find and study the dozens of Earthlike planets in our nearby neighborhood. It could resolve objects only 300 light-years in diameter -- the nucleus of a small galaxy or a gas cloud on the way to collapsing into a star and planets, say -- anywhere in the observable universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for the telescope is laid out in ''From Cosmic Birth to Living Earths,'' a report on the future of astronomy commissioned by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), which runs the Hubble and many other observatories on behalf of <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span>. It was written by a committee headed by Sara Seager of the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and Julianne Dalcanton of the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We hope to learn whether or not we are alone in the universe,'' said Matt Mountain, the president of AURA and the former director of the Hubble, at a news conference at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only once in the arc of our species, Dr. Mountain said, will we turn a corner and be able to determine how the universe and our planet were formed and whether we are alone. ''We can be that generation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only if we start now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In releasing the report, the AURA group is putting down a marker in the long, elaborate and very political process by which major scientific projects are chosen and funded. Every 10 years, a committee of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> surveys the astronomical community and produces a prioritized wish list for the next decade. This survey, which happens next in 2020, serves as a blueprint for Congress and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AURA has done this before. Back in 1995, the organization put out a report, led by Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories, calling for a space telescope to succeed the Hubble. That became the James Webb Space Telescope, designed to look for the first stars and galaxies in the universe, and it is on target for launching in 2018, 23 years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the modern era,'' Dr. Mountain said, ''only space scientists are this patient.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cost of the Webb telescope swelled from an initial budget in 1996 of $1.6 billion to nearly $9 billion, acting like a wrecking ball to the rest of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s space science budget. To avoid retracing that trail of tears, the AURA astronomers said <span class="companylink">NASA</span> should start investing now in the critical technologies needed to make future telescopes work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the High Definition telescope is not destined to be the next item on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s list, or even next to next. After Webb in the pipeline is the ungainly named Wfirst-Afta (don't ask) designed to investigate dark energy, the mysterious something that is speeding the expansion of the cosmos. That mission was the first priority of the 2010 survey, and it could lift off in 2024 if all goes well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The High Definition Space Telescope stands at the end of an exciting line of exoplanet research. Thanks to the Kepler spacecraft, astronomers think they now know that roughly 10 percent of the stars in our galaxy have Earth-size planets at the so-called Goldilocks distance suitable for liquid water and life. But the planets Kepler has discovered are too far away -- hundreds of light-years -- to study closely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is already one rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, that could launch this telescope, and the Space Launch System that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is developing to send astronauts to deep space would be even better. Packed into a rocket, the telescope would unfold in space like a butterfly spreading its wings, a technique <span class="companylink">NASA</span> hopes it has perfected with the Webb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, even a million miles from Earth, it could be serviceable by robots or even astronauts. ''It would be crazy not to do it,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the museum's Hayden Planetarium, who moderated a discussion of the telescope report. He noted that a million miles would be by far the farthest a human had ever been from Earth, smashing the record set when the Apollo 13 astronauts swung around the moon and reached a distance of 249,000 miles in 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing in the back of the room at the museum was Michael Massimino, a former astronaut who twice worked on Hubble in orbit and is now a Columbia professor and adviser at the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum</span>. He said he would be happy to go. When I asked him afterward, he sadly agreed that by 2030, humans will still not have been any farther into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest pending technical problem is suppressing the glare from stars to find their planets. The sun, for example, is 10 billion times brighter than the Earth. The future space telescope would be equipped with an internal coronagraph, a disk that blocks light from the central star, making a dim planet more visible, and perhaps eventually a star shade that would float miles out in front of it to do the same thing. Investing in this light-suppression technology now might prevent the cost overruns that led to the Webb telescope's nearly being canceled a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which raises the delicate issue of how much this would all cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lacking the kind of detailed design from which estimates could be reliably made, Dr. Mountain and his colleagues said only that it would qualify as what <span class="companylink">NASA</span> calls a ''flagship mission,'' like Hubble. That puts it in the ballpark of $10 billion, the same as the cost of CERN's Large Hadron Collider, where the Higgs boson was discovered three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I used to think $10 billion was a lot of money before TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bailout that saved the banks in 2008 and apparently has brought happy days back to Wall Street. Compared with this, the science budget is chump change, lunch money at a place like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. But if you think this is not a bargain, you need look only as far as your pocket. Companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and Apple have leveraged modest investments in computer science in the 1960s into trillions of dollars of economic activity. Not even Arthur C. Clarke, the vaunted author and space-age prophet, saw that coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is to say that all that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> money -- whether for planetary probes or space station trips -- is spent on Earth, on things that we like to say we want more of: high technology, education, a more skilled work force, jobs, pride in American and human innovation, not to mention greater cosmic awareness, a dose of perspective on our situation here among the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if we never discover even a single microbe anywhere else, the money spent on the search for life out there will make life better for those of us stuck here on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing to be gained by delaying. As Dr. Seager from M.I.T. said, the central question -- are we alone? -- is not going away. ''It will always have a price tag on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to the young people in the audience, Dr. Tyson said, ''If you're 12 years old now, you'll be our age by the time it happens, and then you will be carrying the torch.''</p>

Specifically, I wanted to ride a horse over the hills and mountains of the West that we always passed by on car trips and see what was on the other side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagined that over every hill, there would be a new hill, new mysteries and frontiers. New territory and new possibilities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This hardly makes me unique. Humans have been seeking out new territory ever since they wandered out of Africa. You can imagine many sound evolutionary reasons for such wanderlust: encouraging diversity, finding new resources, reducing the effect of a single-point catastrophe like drought or a plague. Maybe even the dream of reinventing yourself in a place where nobody knows you used to be a dog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of my life, the hills that have beckoned some of us are worlds, the lands under the sun but beyond the sky. And our horses have been robots with names like Mariner, Viking, Voyager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 14, we are to clear the last of the big hills. After a journey of nine and a half years and three billion miles, the New Horizons spacecraft is to go past Pluto, once the ninth and outermost planet, the last of the known worlds to be explored. This is the beginning of the end of a phase of human exploration. The crawling-out-of-our-cradle-and-looking-around part is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the hills are always more hills, and beyond the worlds are more worlds. So New Horizons will go on, if all goes well, to pass by one or more of the cosmic icebergs of the Kuiper belt, where leftovers from the dawn of the solar system have been preserved in a deep freeze extending five billion miles from the sun. If all goes well, spacecraft like Dawn, now orbiting the asteroid Ceres, and the Rosetta spacecraft orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, will keep picking away at the supporting cast of solar system characters, who, as in many a well-crafted movie, could turn out to be the most interesting characters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the inventory of major planets -- whether you count Pluto as one of those or not -- is about to be done. None of us alive today will see a new planet up close for the first time again. In some sense, this is, as Alan Stern, the leader of the New Horizons mission, says, ''the last picture show.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to write these words and know what they might feel like 50 years from now. I never dreamed, when Apollo astronauts left the moon in 1972, that there might come a day when there was nobody still alive who had been to the moon. But now it seems that could come to pass. How heartbreaking is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could say that we have reached the sea, the very icy and black sea between us and the stars. Whether we will ever cross that sea nobody can say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say that marvelous or even the most fundamental discoveries of all aren't still in store for us here in our own backyard. The first reconnaissance of the solar system has yielded mysteries that will take more than a human lifetime to resolve, especially given the anemic pace of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s explorations and the increasingly long time it takes to get a space mission approved and actually out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as scientists can keep prying nickels from the clenched fists of legislators, probes will keep popping off to Mars every couple of years. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> now has plans to send a spacecraft to Jupiter's moon Europa, which has a salty ocean underneath its ice, and may get around to flying a probe through the geysers spurting from the Saturnian moon Enceladus someday to sniff for organic materials. My personal favorite is the idea to send a boat to float around on the methane seas and lakes of Titan, Saturn's biggest moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of one microbe anywhere out there that was not our own would be the greatest scientific event of the age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all began when Mariner 2 went past Venus in 1962.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Myths and hopes have been punctured along the way, starting with the dream of life on Mars. Mariner 4 went past Mars three years later and sent back pictures of a cratered, dead-looking world. Goodbye, dreams of finding canals and ancient apocalyptically advanced and dying civilizations. Hello, sifting the red sands for microbes or anything organic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I came into this game when, as a late-blooming writer for Discover magazine, I climbed onto the back of a pair of horses named Voyager in 1980 for the first of two passes by Saturn. I could hardly believe my luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the press room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we reporters could watch the latest Voyager images coming down from space at the same time as the scientists in their own building a few yards away. If somebody or something was holding up a ''Yankee Go Home'' sign in some distant crater, or in fact just waving, we would all see it at the same time. Every morning, befuddled scientists, unused to doing instant science in public, would report for a news conference and confess that they didn't know what this or that really was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were all seeing new territory, things nobody had seen before, all at the same time. It was like riding on the nose of the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next decade, every couple of years or so, the tribes would gather in Pasadena, Calif., for weeklong planetary encounters that were half celebrations of humanity and curiosity, half parties. At some point, some evening, Jonathan Eberhart, the Science News correspondent and folk singer, would sing space ballads in his whiskey voice to a roomful of mellowed-out space fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While particle physicists pursuing string were locking into what they thought was an equation suitable for a T-shirt that would explain creation, Voyager was wending outward past Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, showing just how diverse and unpredictable the arrangements of the material universe could be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every planetfall was a surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What mostly received attention were volcanoes. Sulfur on the Jovian moon Io, smog and hydrocarbon lakes on Titan, cracks in the fresh ice of Europa, plumes of nitrogen and water on Triton, dark spokes on the rings of Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of something, anything -- even water -- moving so far from the light and warmth of the sun, out there on the shoreline of the solar system, seemed miraculous to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It still does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks for the ride.</p>

Included were experiments, a replacement spacesuit, a camera to record meteors streaking into Earth's atmosphere and the first of two docking adapters that would serve as parking spots for future crew capsules being developed by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> had planned to install two capsule parking spaces, but one would suffice, Mr. Suffredini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had a charmed record with the Falcon 9, avoiding the ''infant mortality'' that usually afflicts new rocket designs, with 18 successes in 18 launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 19th launching, more attention was paid to the company's attempts to land the first stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic. The company has invested considerable effort toward recovering and ultimately reusing the first stages in the hope of significantly cutting the cost of rocket launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the company will need to regroup, a process that most likely will take several months but less than a year, Ms. Shotwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We must find this cause of the failure,'' she said. ''We must fix it, and obviously we're going to get back to flight. It's a reminder -- it's not a great reminder, but it is a reminder nonetheless -- of how difficult this is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said the mishap also emphasized the need for full financing of the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> crew capsules, which are to start taking astronauts to the space station in 2017. The Obama administration requested $1.2 billion for the 2016 fiscal year for the program, known as commercial crew, but a budget bill passed by the House of Representatives included $1 billion, and a budget bill in the Senate would provide even less: $900 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we don't get the funding, we can't do the technical work,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said. ''The technical work gets delayed or compressed. And this environment is not conducive to letting us compress or delay technical work.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDAt 8:45 p.m. on a warm, clear night, the last rays of the setting sun lit up a remote mountaintop a thousand feet above the small Chilean town of Vicuña. Mother Nature's show, however, was just beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I saw Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, first. Later came the Tres Marias, as the three glittering studs in Orion's belt are known here. Then as violet hues faded to black, there were dozens, then suddenly hundreds of stars. An hour later the Milky Way blazed across the dome of the sky, a glimmering helix of light and darkness.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emilio Lepeley, our guide for the night at Mamalluca Observatory, aimed a green laser into the sky. ''The Incas had dark constellations,'' he said, referring to the practice of finding forms in the ''empty'' areas between stars. ''Can you see the llama?'' Outside, 50 or so people milled about at the observatory doors, the usual summer crush waiting their turn for a peek through the telescope inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mamalluca is one of about a dozen observatories in northern Chile's Elqui Valley region that cater to astrotourists (once known simply as stargazers). An oasis in an otherwise arid landscape, the roughly 90-mile-long valley stretches from the Pacific Ocean eastward into the Andean foothills. Its geography, with the cloud-blocking Andes to the east and the bone-dry Atacama Desert to the north, produces exceptionally clear conditions, optimal for stargazing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in the 1960s, a string of major international research telescopes were built here to take advantage of that, including Cerro Tololo, La Silla and Gemini South, and in 2014 work began on the planet's most powerful space camera. Within five years, an estimated 70 percent of the world's astronomical infrastructure will be in Chile, much of it in the Elqui Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, would-be astronomers and stargazers are getting in on the act, too, drawn by the region's famously clear night skies and a host of charms equally evident by daylight. Growing popularity among Chileans and international visitors, however, has posed a challenge of its own: As towns sprawl onto surrounding hillsides and resulting light pollution spreads, will those pristine night skies last?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reach Vicuña, the biggest municipality inside the valley and a hub for astrotourism, I had driven an hour east from the coastal city of La Serena, climbing slowly along the aptly named Ruta de Las Estrellas, or Route of the Stars. Vineyards and orchards along the valley floor eventually gave way to cactuses stippling the flanks of steep ridges. The region has long been a getaway for Chileans, who flock to a string of small towns filled with centuries-old Spanish churches and distilleries that produce pisco from local grapes. After dark, however, attention turns to the skies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mamalluca was among the region's first observatories for casual stargazers, others now offer a more intimate peek into the universe, with better equipment and smaller groups. The following night, I headed down to Vicuña's main plaza for a ride to the area's most powerful tourist telescope, situated on a hard-to-reach mountaintop outside town. In the plaza, a restaurant named Halley (after the comet) did a brisk business in empanadas, while stray dogs lazed in the shade of an ornate Catholic church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 9 p.m., a battered S.U.V. rumbled up, and I got inside with a half-dozen other stargazers. On a moonless night, we barreled up rutted dirt roads for nearly an hour, climbing along switchbacks before reaching our destination, the privately run Pangue Observatory, which was seemingly the only structure for miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were met by Eric Escalera, a retired French astrophysicist who formerly worked at nearby La Silla Observatory. ''Government telescopes are actually very boring,'' he said, leading us to an outdoor viewing platform and a 10-foot-tall telescope silhouetted against the sky like a piece of artillery. ''They're just for collecting data -- you never actually get to see anything. This is more fun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the isolated ridge, conditions were inky black, and it was impossible to see more than a foot or two ahead without a flashlight. Mr. Escalera motioned to the Milky Way, even gaudier up here, and pointed out two faint puffs of light nearby -- distant galaxies more than 150,000 light years away known as the Magellanic Clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To actually use Pangue's 25-inch telescope (enormous for hobbyists, though puny, we were told, by research standards), it was necessary to climb a stepladder and look into an eyepiece at the top. Mr. Escalera first focused in on the Tarantula Nebula, a nursery for stars located inside the Large Magellanic Cloud. Through the lens, the mass of gas and dust did indeed look like a giant spider, its body outlined by the nebula's pale glow. (Don't expect those brilliantly colored images of outer space that show up on screen savers and dorm-room posters; the real thing turns out to be much more subdued.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the night wore on, we took turns gazing at a creamy mass of stars called a globular cluster; Jupiter, with four of its moons and bands of tropical clouds; and an aging pair of stars called Eta Carinae, racing toward a violent end as a supernova. But the real show, at least for a novice like me, didn't require a telescope at all. As midnight approached, the southern sky was a dense canopy of stars, packed tighter than I'd thought possible. A distant thunderstorm in Argentina sent up flashes of light from the east, while the screech of night birds cut through the darkness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, on a hot, cloudless morning, I continued my journey east on the Ruta de Las Estrellas. After Vicuña, the valley floor drops away dramatically and the drive turns into a twisting, roller coaster ascent. I passed adobe houses clinging to cliffside ledges and fruit stands selling fresh tuna, the fruit of the local cactus, before reaching the village of Pisco Elqui, a traditional favorite among Chilean vacationers that's been enjoying a mini-boom in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late afternoon, I climbed the village's cobblestone streets with Bayron Muñoz, the guide on a trekking tour that takes stargazers on foot into the local mountains. ''Does anyone suffer from vertigo?'' he asked, before we turned onto a steep rocky trail. As the sun dipped behind a ridge, we shuffled past the ruined remains of adobe huts and centuries-old canals, carved into the mountainside by the indigenous Diaguita people and still pulsing with water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was nearly dark when we toed along the lip of a yawning canyon and scampered up a rise -- only to discover a tour van, which had evidently arrived via a less harrowing route. The advance group had been nice enough to start a campfire, however, as well as mix up a round of pisco sours, which were passed around as we turned our view to the darkening sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laser pointers flitted through the darkness, tracing over constellations (Orion, Taurus, Cancer), the glowing orb of Jupiter and the intergalactic dandelion puffs of the Magellanic Clouds. Afterward, we looked into a small, eight-inch portable telescope, hauled up the mountain on our account, at the famous red supergiant star, Betelgeuse, and Sirius, which glittered like a diamond under a jeweler's loupe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was hard to miss the dull glow of lights from the valley below, which blotted out all but the most brilliant stars in one corner of the sky. ''Pisco Elqui is getting bigger all the time,'' Mr. Muñoz said. ''More construction means more light pollution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, unblemished skies are becoming harder to find throughout the valley. The yellowish glare from the growing twin coastal cities of La Serena and Coquimbo -- whose combined populations have nearly doubled in the last 20 years to more than 400,000 -- is a constant on the western horizon, while light pollution in Vicuña has already raised flags at the major international observatories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the influx of domestic and international travelers means Elqui Valley's stars now have more competition than ever. With billions of dollars in astronomical infrastructure at stake, the Chilean government has had to go on the defensive. In 1999, a law to protect the integrity of night skies in places like the Elqui Valley was implemented, which included provisions to shield streetlights and limit the power of public lighting. Beefed-up requirements went into effect in 2014, taking into account billboards and new sources of pollution like LEDs and other so-called white lights, big offenders in terms of sky glow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But late that same night on the edge of Pisco Elqui, it would have been hard to imagine a more brilliant sky. Several miles outside town, near where this leg of the Ruta de las Estrellas dead ends against the vertical wall of the Andes, a collection of mini geodesic domes has been built on a hillside -- part of Elqui Domos, a hotel catering to stargazers. Each PVC-wrapped dome has a raised bed inside, with a zip-away panel in the ceiling -- a private window onto the universe. (The domes do turn into ovens once the sun rises, however, a factor to consider if you plan to sleep in.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time I got back from my mountain trek, most domes had gone dark, but the silhouettes of a few were still glowing softly. I stepped inside mine, climbed to the loft and unzipped the skylight. Orion stared back at me, bow tensed and ready. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, more and more stars came into view, stars packed upon stars. I watched a gleaming planet climb higher in the sky before falling asleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to Get There</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of La Serena, gateway to the Elqui Valley, is a one-hour flight from Santiago. From the airport, rent a car and follow Ruta 41, part of the Ruta de Las Estrellas, which extends east to Vicuña (a roughly one-hour drive) and other astrotourism hot spots.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Washington is catching up.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the nation's agencies that build civilian rockets and nuclear arms sealed an agreement to start working together on planetary defense. The goal is to learn how to better deflect comets and asteroids that might endanger cities and, in the case of very large intruders, the planet as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often, these agencies focus on their own pieces of the puzzle, so anything that brings them together is a good thing,'' said Bruce Betts, director of science and technology at the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>, a nonprofit group that promotes space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets and asteroids are part of the cosmic rubble left over from the birth of the solar system. Comets, made of dirty ice, visit Earth's neighborhood only when knocked loose from their home orbits beyond Pluto. That makes their movement somewhat unpredictable. Asteroids, made of rock, fly mostly in a belt between Mars and Jupiter. Their orbits can be calculated with great precision if astronomers can spot the dim objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rocky debris rains down steadily on Earth, mostly as dust grains and tiny pebbles. But every once in a while a tumbling giant, miles wide, such as the one thought to have done in the dinosaurs, zooms past the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, this extraterrestrial threat gained new credibility after a 7,000-ton rock -- roughly 60 feet wide and technically a meteoroid, smaller than an asteroid -- exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, injuring 1,500 people, mainly as shards flew from shattered windows. The dazzling light from the rocky intruder blinded eyes and burned skin even though the temperature that day was far below freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two agencies -- <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and the <span class="companylink">National Nuclear Security Administration</span> -- have long studied such threats on their own. They have surveyed the cosmic debris, designed rocket interceptors and run supercomputer simulations to see if a nuclear blast could nudge a large asteroid off course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews, federal officials and private experts said the new interagency agreement would deepen the levels of expert cooperation and governmental planning, ultimately increasing the chances of a successful deflection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a big step forward,'' said Kevin Greenaugh, a senior official at the nuclear security agency. ''Whenever you have multiple agencies coming together for the common defense, that's news.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists who favor nonnuclear means of asteroid interception said the atomic method would become suitable only if a large threat materialized too quickly for countermeasures that were less powerful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to see it as a last-ditch option,'' said H. Jay Melosh, a geophysicist at <span class="companylink">Purdue University</span> who served on a national panel in 2010 that evaluated the extraterrestrial threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new federal step comes amid rising public and private interest in the loose cannons of the cosmos. This year, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> unveiled a website that lets visitors explore the cratered surface of Vesta, one of the solar system's largest asteroids at more than 300 miles across. The agency also released a computer app that -- at least in theory -- lets amateur astronomers help the agency find new asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 30, experts and advocates, including Brian May, an astrophysicist who is a founding member and the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen, are holding a global awareness campaign called Asteroid Day. The date is the anniversary of the largest asteroid impact in recent history -- in 1908, when a cosmic intruder toppled millions of trees in Siberia with a blast judged a thousand times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that leveled Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An example of prior federal research comes from the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, the birthplace of the bomb. An astrophysicist there, Robert Weaver, ran supercomputer simulations that the lab hailed in an article two years ago as exploratory steps for ''Killing Killer Asteroids.'' It quoted him as saying such research ''will hopefully give policy makers a better understanding of what their options are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And eight years ago, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists detailed plans for an interceptor rocket tipped with a B83 -- a warhead about 75 times as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews, officials have declined to say whether any specific arms in the nation's nuclear arsenal have been set aside for countering extraterrestrial strikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a discussion,'' David S.P. Dearborn, an astrophysicist at the <span class="companylink">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</span> in California, said in an interview, ''about what should be held onto'' even as the country seeks to modernize and trim its nuclear stockpile in accordance with disarmament treaties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A global disaster, scientists say, would require the impact of an asteroid or comet having a diameter of at least three-fifths of a mile. So far, they have found about 1,000 such objects that periodically cross the Earth's path, though none are seen as posing a collision threat in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, scientists estimate that millions of smaller rocks whirl on paths close to the planet, most of them untracked, and warrant much closer scrutiny lest they batter cities and cripple regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's more complex than most people realize,'' Dr. Betts of the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span> said of a mission to deflect a speeding boulder, especially with a nuclear warhead. ''Ideally,'' he added, ''we won't have to use it, but we should talk about it and understand it before having to make the hard decisions.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that they had discovered a lost generation of monster stars that ushered light into the universe after the Big Bang and jump-started the creation of the elements needed for planets and life before disappearing forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern-day stars like our sun have a healthy mix of heavy elements, known as metals, but in the aftermath of the Big Bang only hydrogen, helium and small traces of lithium were available to make the first stars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such stars could have been hundreds or thousands of times as massive as the sun, according to calculations, burning brightly and dying quickly, only 200 million years after the universe began. Their explosions would have spewed into space the elements that started the chain of thermonuclear reactions by which subsequent generations of stars have gradually enriched the cosmos with elements like oxygen, carbon and iron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spotting the older stars in action is one of the prime missions of the James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> in 2018. The discovery of such stars ''would be wonderful,'' James Peebles, a Princeton professor and one of the fathers of modern cosmology, said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in a paper to be published in The Astrophysical Journal, an international crew of astronomers led by David Sobral of the <span class="companylink">University of Lisbon</span>, in Portugal, and the Leiden Observatory, in the Netherlands, said they had spotted the signature of these first-generation stars in a recently discovered galaxy that existed when the universe was only about 800 million years old. Its light has been traveling to us for 12.9 billion years, while succeeding generations of stars have worked their magic to make the universe interesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The galaxy, known as CR7, is three times as luminous as any previously found from that time, the authors said. Within it is a bright blue cloud that seems to contain only hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email, Dr. Sobral called this the first direct evidence of the stars ''that ultimately allowed us all to be here by fabricating heavy elements and changing the composition of the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement from the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span>, he said, ''It doesn't really get any more exciting than this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a veteran of the search for early galaxies, pointed out, however, that these stars were appearing far later in cosmic history than theory had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sobral and his colleagues were using the Very Large Telescope of the Southern Observatory in Chile and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, among other big telescopes, to build on an earlier search for glowing clouds of hydrogen that might represent very early galaxies. Galaxy CR7 -- short for Cosmos Redshift 7, after the method by which distant objects in the universe are dated -- stood out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an expanding universe, the farther away or back in time an object is, the faster it is receding, which causes the wavelength of light from it to lengthen, the way the pitch of a siren sounds lower after it passes. In astronomy, this lengthening is known as redshifting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The galaxy's name, Dr. Sobral said, was also inspired by the great Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, a.k.a. CR7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in much of astronomy, the nomenclature of these star generations is awkwardly rooted in history and Earth-centered. Modern stars like the sun, with healthy abundances of so-called metals (anything heavier than helium), are now called Population I, mainly because they were the first known. They mostly inhabit the spiral arms and younger parts of galaxies like the Milky Way. In the middle of the 20th century, however, the astronomer Walter Baade noticed that the stars in older parts of the galaxy, like its core or globular clusters, are older and have fewer metals. He called them Population II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advent of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe forced astronomers to realize that the first stars must have had no metals at all; those are known as Population III.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars of both Population II and Population III are probably present in CR7, Dr. Sobral and his team report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the blue cloud is metal-free, according to spectral measurements, the color of the rest of the galaxy is consistent with more evolved stars making up most of its mass. This suggests, they write, that the Population III stars there are late bloomers of a sort, forming from leftover clouds of pristine material as the galaxy was sending out its light 12.9 billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only alternative explanation, Dr. Sobral said, is something so spectacular and unlikely that astronomers do not know if it has ever happened, namely a primordial cloud bypassing the star stage and collapsing directly into a black hole. That, he noted, is impossible to rule out because nobody really knows what it should look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb could help resolve the issue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the image that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> created, and that's what ''The Astronaut Wives Club,'' an ABC series that begins on Thursday, seeks to debunk. This show applies the ''Mad Men'' formula to the women who stood behind the heroes of the conquest of space. It's an amused but gauzy look back at a prefeminist era when women deferred to their husbands, wore gloves to church and took one another potluck dishes like Tater Tot Surprise and Jell-O salad.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Savage (''Gossip Girl'') created ''The Astronaut Wives Club'' from the nonfiction book of the same title by Lily Koppel, a former reporter for The New York Times. It focuses on the frustrations and hardships that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> wives, like all military spouses, endured behind the scenes, but this account has more than a tinge of nostalgia for a time that had clear rules and, better yet, a midcentury style that these days is all the rage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series purports to tell the real story behind the Project Mercury publicity machine, but it is so enamored of the early-'60s aesthetic that it can't resist adding its own flawless, cameo-faced gloss to its heroines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Astronaut Wives Club'' isn't the first network series to romanticize the past while also trying to deconstruct it. At the peak of ''Mad Men'' mania in 2011, NBC came up with ''The Playboy Club,'' and ABC had ''Pan Am,'' shows that were both dreamy evocations of a bygone era, before Betty Friedan and women's lib. They idealized the struggle and the indignity of serving men drinks in a bunny costume or in a tight stewardess uniform. Men made the rules, but women got to work and found female solidarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this show, the astronauts are held up to the public as demigods, and their wives become known as the First Ladies of Space, subject to almost as much scrutiny and fascination as President Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline, who invites some of them to tea at the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the series's seven wives, based on the real women, are as blandly perfect and contented as they appear in the pages of Life magazine, which bought exclusive rights to their stories as soon as their husbands were selected to be the first Americans in space. (In 1961, the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin got there first, which made <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s goal all the more urgent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudy Cooper (Odette Annable), married to Gordon Cooper (Bret Harrison), is a pilot herself and was on the verge of divorcing her philandering husband when he got the call; she goes along to Cape Canaveral, Fla., for the reflected glory. Louise Shepard (Dominique McElligott) has little control over Alan Shepard (Desmond Harrington), who seems like an All-American boy scout but mostly earns badges for seducing groupies clustered around the motel pool. Marge Slayton (Erin Cummings) has secrets in her past that could stunt the career of her husband, Deke (Kenneth Mitchell): She was divorced from her first husband and, worse, for a time worked overseas as a single woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they gather at Cape Canaveral, the wives are at first wary and competitive on their husbands' behalf, but over time and shared worry, they begin to bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When not in training, the Mercury astronauts are on the loose. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> expects the wives to cover up their husbands' peccadilloes, and a reporter for Life is on hand at all times, making sure that their behind-the-scenes tensions, jealousies and fears are whitewashed for an adoring public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The characters are likable but surprisingly flimsy. They not only look as smooth as their retouched magazine photos, but their personalities also aren't much more complex; they have flaws, but they are basically all good women who stand by their brave men and support one another. ''Army Wives,'' a Lifetime series that focused on the ordeals of military spouses raising families while their mates served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was much more realistic and, surprisingly, given the subject, more fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real excitement in this series is found not in motel rooms or boozy barbecues but inside the command center at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, where early launches were terrifying -- the most intense countdown scenes fade to black and white to echo the news coverage of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creators of ''The Astronaut Wives Club'' may have wanted to avoid belittling their heroines in a space age version of ''Desperate Housewives,'' but they did them a different disservice by sugarcoating them almost as much as <span class="companylink">NASA</span> did some 50 years ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LightSail, an ambitious privately financed project to demonstrate using the force of sunlight for propulsion, has had a bumpy life in orbit since it launched last month. Particles of light reflect off an expansive sail of shiny Mylar, providing momentum, and the hope is that this could be an effective way to push future space probes through the solar system without fuel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But twice during the mission, LightSail dropped completely out of touch and then later revived. On Sunday, it received the command to extend four 13-foot booms and the sail, which spans nearly 345 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LightSail ignored it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the next orbit, the command was sent again, and this time, the spacecraft's tiny electric motor started whirring. Data including the 134,200 turns of the motor and the slowing of the spacecraft's spin indicated that the sail was out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The deployment was perfect, better than anyone expected,'' said William Sanford Nye, the chief executive of the Planetary Society, who is better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But seeing is believing -- or worth a thousand telemetry readings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, the spacecraft sent out a couple of pictures it had taken. But something went wrong, and no one could figure out how to turn the bits of data into pictures. Later, the team downloaded the pictures again, and this time they could see part of the sail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Lakdawalla, the senior editor of the Planetary Society, the nonprofit organization running the LightSail project, unscrambled the pieces to produce an incomplete picture that nonetheless shows the sail stretched out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the full image was finally downloaded. ''Then we got the big beautiful shot,'' Mr. Nye said. ''We're feeling pretty good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, the booms were not fully extended, because of uncertainties of how much they would expand in the warmth of sunlight. After a few more photographs, the engineers will push them out a little more. ''The potential problem is the booms might buckle,'' Mr. Nye said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within days, LightSail will fall out of orbit, because the drag of the sail through the upper atmosphere is greater than the propulsive force of sunshine. Next year, a second LightSail is to be launched to a higher orbit to demonstrate controlled solar sailing.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For two weeks at the end of March, Volcan Sierra Negra, an extinct 15,000-foot volcano also known as Tliltepetl that looms over the landscape in southern Mexico, was the nerve center for the largest telescope ever conceived, a network of antennas that reaches from Spain to Hawaii to Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as the Event Horizon Telescope, named after the point of no return in a black hole, its job was to see what has been until now unseeable: an exquisitely small, dark circle of nothing, a tiny shadow in the glow of radiation at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. It is there that astronomers think lurks a supermassive black hole, a trap door into which the equivalent of four million suns has evidently disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nature, Albert Einstein once said, is not malicious, only subtle. But it loves a good fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lightning greeted Dr. Doeleman and his crew of astronomers late one night as they crested the summit of their outpost in the unfriendly sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What little air there was tasted the way you might imagine it would on Mars. Snowflakes swirled around their heads. The Large Millimeter Telescope, a 20-story tower with a 150-foot-wide bowl-shaped antenna sitting like an oversize cocked hat on its roof, was barely visible in the gloom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers stepped gingerly out of their cars onto a moonscape of rocks and down a ramp into the telescope's basement, a labyrinth of warmly lit rooms and labs, as if entering the lair of a James Bond villain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman had planned to spend the night working out new techniques to point the telescope, which among its other problems was afflicted by a persistent and annoying electrical hum. By the time the weather had cleared enough, the radio dish was frozen solid underneath an inch of ice. The stars whirled above, past the remains of storm clouds, their secrets unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is par for us,'' Dr. Doeleman, a fresh-faced 48-year-old researcher from M.I.T.'s Haystack Observatory and the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, said with a mix of resignation and pride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he and his colleagues succeed, the images they capture will be in textbooks forever, as definitive evidence of Einstein's weirdest prediction: that space-time could curl up like a magician's cloak around massive objects and vanish them from the universe. In short, that black holes -- objects so dense that not even light can escape their maws -- are real. That space and time as we know them can come to an end right under our noses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, they could produce evidence that Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, the rule of rules for the universe, needs fixing for the first time since it was introduced a hundred years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're swinging for the fences,'' Dr. Doeleman, who has spent eight years putting this effort together, said one afternoon in an office in Serdan, a small town at the volcano's base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was dressed in long johns and layers of sweaters and fleece, and sipped coca-leaf tea to combat the effects of altitude. He was sweaty, and his hair stood on end in an Einsteinian Mohawk after a long night trying to troubleshoot his telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to worry about everything, from soup to nuts,'' he said, ticking off all the things that make this radio network, stretched like a spider web across the planet, a fragile object. Success hinges on the exigencies of weather on several continents, high-strung technology, altitude, even traffic -- two of his colleagues had just been delayed in a car accident on the way from Mexico City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess spider silk is stronger than steel,'' he said, ''but even spider silk can snap.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cosmic Roach Motel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes were one of the first and most extreme predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, first announced in November 1915. It explains the force we call gravity as objects trying to follow a straight line through a universe whose geometry is warped by matter and energy. As a result, planets as well as light beams follow curving paths, like balls going around a roulette wheel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein was taken aback a few months later when Karl Schwarzschild, a German astronomer then serving on the Russian front, pointed out that the equations contained an apocalyptic prediction: Cramming too much matter and energy inside too small a space would cause space-time to sag without limit. No force known to science could stop it from becoming a sinkhole from which not even light could escape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein could not fault the math, but he figured that in real life, nature would find some way to avoid such a calamity. A century later, however, astronomers agree that space is indeed sprinkled with massive objects that emit no light at all. Call them cosmic roach motels. Stars, atoms, wisps of gas that trace their pedigree to the Big Bang -- all of them check in, never to check out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of them are supposed to be the remnants of massive stars that have burned out, collapsed and imploded in cataclysms like supernovas or the even more violent gamma-ray bursts visible across the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generations of theorists, including Stephen Hawking, using the telescope of the mind, have made careers investigating the properties of these objects only barely in the universe. But they are still arguing about just what happens inside a black hole and the ultimate fate of whatever falls in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every galaxy seems to harbor one of these dark monsters, millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun, squatting at its center like Dante's devil. The bigger the galaxy, for some reason, the more massive the void inside it. How that happens is a cosmic nature-versus-nurture question, and anyone's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How does a black hole know how big a galaxy it's in and when to stop growing?'' mused David Hughes, the director of the Large Millimeter Telescope, ''or, conversely, how does the galaxy know to stop feeding it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left by themselves, black holes lie dormant with their mouths open. But when something -- say, a wayward star or gas cloud -- does fall toward a black hole, it is heated to billions of degrees as it swirls in a doughnut called an accretion disk around the cosmic drain. Black holes are sloppy eaters, and when they feed, jets of X-rays and radio energy can be squeezed like toothpaste out of a tube from the accretion disks. Astronomers believe this is what produces the energies of quasars, brilliant beacons in the cores of galaxies that far outshine the starry cities in which they dwell. ''Paradoxically,'' Dr. Doeleman said, ''that makes black holes some of brightest things in the sky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last winter, a team of astronomers from Beijing University and the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span> announced that they had discovered one of the biggest, baddest black holes yet -- 10 billion times as massive as the sun, anchoring a quasar that was blazing 40,000 times brighter than the Milky Way when the universe was only a billion years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the action is so far, far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center of the Milky Way, 26,000 light-years from here, coincides with a faint source of radio noise called Sagittarius A*. Astronomers like U.C.L.A.'s Andrea Ghez tracking the orbits of stars circling the center have been able to calculate that whatever is at the center has the mass of four million suns. But it emits no visible or infrared light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this is not a black hole, neither Einstein nor anyone else knows what it could be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is the strongest evidence so far for an event horizon,'' Dr. Doeleman said, using the name for the boundary of a black hole, the edge that is the point of no return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is only a circumstantial argument, assuming that Einstein was right. ''If Einstein was wrong, how would we know?'' said Avery Broderick, a theorist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, noting that general relativity, for all its mathematical beauty, had never been tested under the extreme conditions that would prevail in the Big Bang or black holes, where the full weirdness of Einsteinian space-time would manifest itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to work that goes back to a paper by James Bardeen in 1967, the Sagittarius black hole, if it is there, would appear as a ghostly dark circle amid a haze of radio waves. Its exact shape, the theorists say, would depend on details like how fast the hole is spinning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black hole's own gravity will distort and magnify its image, resulting in a shadow about 50 million miles across, appearing about as big from here as an orange would on the moon, according to calculations performed by Eric Agol of the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span>, Heino Falcke of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany and Fulvio Melia of the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>, in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proof of the pudding for Einstein would be if radio astronomers could determine that the shadow, the graveyard of four million suns, really was that small. They have been whittling its size ever since Sagittarius A* was discovered, in 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, a group led by Shen Zhiqiang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory narrowed the diameter of Sagittarius A* to a cloud of energy less than 90 million miles across, about twice the size of the long-sought shadow, using the Very Long Baseline Array, a transcontinental network of antennas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For most people, seeing is believing,'' Dr. Agol said at the time. But there was a problem getting measurements any finer. The ionized electrons and protons in interstellar space scattered the radio waves into a blur that obscured details of the source. ''It's like looking through frosted glass,'' Dr. Doeleman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see deeper into the black hole shadow, they needed to be able to tune their radio telescope to shorter wavelengths that could penetrate the haze. And they needed a bigger telescope. The bigger the antenna, the higher resolution or magnification it can achieve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our black hole is active but eating on a slow diet, with billion-degree gas around it,'' Dr. Doeleman said. The result, at the heart of the Milky Way, is ''a puffy cloud,'' he said. ''You need the right frequency to see through the debris at the galactic center.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter the Event Horizon Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Edge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman had taken a wandering path to the edge of infinity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son of a science teacher, he grew up in Oregon and studied physics at <span class="companylink">Reed College</span> in Portland. He applied to attend graduate school at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, but before he could go, he saw an ad looking for people to do experiments in the Antarctic. He signed up and spent most of a couple of years at the bottom of the world. ''It was there that I probably caught the bug for doing science under challenging circumstances,'' Dr. Doeleman said. He reapplied to M.I.T. from Antarctica and then wandered around Asia on his way home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At M.I.T., he first joined a group doing plasma physics, then dabbled in X-ray astronomy and biophysics before joining a radio astronomy group. The technique of choice for radio astronomers is known by the intimidating name of very long baseline interferometry -- V.L.B.I. for short -- in which separate radio telescopes as far as a continent apart can be joined in a synchronized network that mimics a single antenna with a very big diameter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman was originally interested in using the technology to monitor movements of the Earth's crust and was hoping to travel to exotic places to install instruments. But it turned out they were already installed. So his eyes turned to the heavens and the mysteries of quasars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a talk recently, Dr. Doeleman showed a picture of a galaxy in the constellation Centaurus, a gentle-looking pearly smoosh of starlight with a slash of dust across its belly. Known as NGC 5128, the galaxy can be seen through binoculars from the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he showed a picture of the same galaxy taken through what he called ''radio goggles.'' In this view, the galaxy is being ripped apart by an explosion at its core, shooting lobes of energy thousands of light-years across space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman traced his interest in quasars and black holes to the moment he first saw images like that. ''Whatever is powering those jets has to be insanely powerful,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Dr. Doeleman had what he calls an ''a-ha moment'' when he and colleagues yoked together three radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona and California into a interferometer system and trained it on the galactic center, using a shorter wavelength. They detected a small blob of energy, ''a dot that would not go away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were seeing something through the frosted glass. But what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, he and his colleagues have devoted their energies to building a network big enough to see whether that radio dot harbors signs of a black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the Event Horizon Telescope involves 20 universities, observatories, research institutions and government agencies, and more than a hundred scientists. Among other things, to keep the radio telescopes in their network suitably synchronized, they had to equip them with new atomic clocks accurate to within one second every 100 million years, and new short-wavelength receivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman recalled having to wear an oxygen tank to test atomic clocks at the new ALMA array, on a 16,000-foot plateau in Chile. Another colleague, Daniel Marrone of the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>, spent last winter at the South Pole installing a new receiver. Both of these installations will eventually join the Event Horizon observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The March observing run was the first time the group would have enough telescopes -- seven radio telescopes, on six mountains -- to begin to hope they could glimpse the black hole. They would have five chances over a period of two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On each night, they hoped to have two black holes in their sights: Sagittarius A*, and one in a giant galaxy known as M87, which anchors the enormous Virgo cluster of galaxies about 50 million light-years away. The M87 black hole has been estimated at six billion times the mass of the sun, and from here, it would appear only slightly smaller than the Milky Way black hole. Moreover, jets of energy shoot like a blowtorch from its accretion disk and across intergalactic space. Astronomers really wanted to get a close look at that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping for Boredom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's beautiful work,'' Andrew Strominger, a <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> theorist who has joined the Event Horizon team, said of the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In practice, it could be gritty or boring, depending on how things were going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit to Sierra Negra in March was Dr. Doeleman's fifth in two years. The commute required a plane ride and five hours in buses, cars and trucks to the small, decidedly untouristic town of Serdan. He sometimes toted a special crystal used to test atomic clocks, which provoked attention from security officers. ''It looks just like you would expect a bomb to look -- a metal cylinder with wires sticking out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his troubles, he often wound up with a headache, the price of working almost three miles above sea level. The telescope control room is outfitted with finger monitors that measure blood oxygen and an oxygen tank and mask for those woozy moments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sierra Negra is next door to an even bigger peak, Pico de Orizaba, Mexico's highest mountain, and the pair combine to create their own weather, which can cause problems for astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night, the telescope was being turned to keep it from filling with snow. Dr. Doeleman was in the unheated receiver room, where light from the antenna's focus bounces off mirrors down an open shaft into boxes the size of microwave ovens, when he felt the building shake. Thinking it might be an earthquake, Dr. Doeleman ran for the elevator, only to find his colleagues rushing up from the control room and offices below. ''I was pretty freaked,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was no earthquake. Because of an electrical malfunction, the gargantuan dish, half a football field wide and weighing 1,600 metric tons, had suddenly lurched to a stop, transferring all that momentum to the structure around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later on, a real earthquake sent the astronomers running from their breakfasts down in Serdan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late March, Dr. Doeleman's collaborators were camped out on similarly uncomfortable mountains in Chile, Hawaii, California, Arizona and Spain, waiting for his signal, based on weather forecasts and the state of their equipment -- all the accouterments of that spider silk -- to begin observing. All the telescopes would point in unison at M87, and then at the galactic center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it works well, this ganging up on the cosmos is ''boring, in a good way,'' Dr. Doeleman said one night that was anything but boring, explaining that the observations best proceed automatically while the astronomers all hold their breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belying the boredom is the hope that in the subtle interplay of radio waves they will see the signature of one of nature's great calamities. Waves from different parts of the radiation cloud around Sagittarius A* would interfere with one another, producing a complicated pattern that a computer could read as a black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine, Dr. Doeleman said, that someone is dipping a finger into a pond and creating ripples. If there were tidal gauges installed along the shore, you could figure out where the ripples were coming from by recording the arrival of each wave crest on the shore. One finger would make concentric circles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there were two fingers doing the dipping, the ripples would interfere with one another, sometimes amplifying, sometimes canceling out. As a result, some tidal gauges would show crests combining to be extra large; others would show troughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By analyzing this pattern,'' Dr. Doeleman said, ''we can tell what's going on far away.'' Someone reading the pattern could distinguish whether there was just one finger or many of them in some arrangement dappling the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, there are antennas spread along the shore of infinity, synchronized by atomic clocks, recording the radio waves as they arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the way you build a telescope as big as the world,'' Dr. Doeleman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If everything went right -- if all the elements of Dr. Doeleman's spider web of weather and electronics and superprecise timing held together -- they would see that any given wavefront would arrive bearing the marks of interference, a complicated pattern of crests and troughs -- ''fringes,'' in the astronomical vernacular. With enough fringes from baselines going in different directions across the sky from the various observatories, the astronomers could reconstruct a map what was happening out there, thousands of millions of light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing even one fringe from one baseline would be a triumph -- it would mean they were achieving the kind of resolution needed to make a detailed image of Sagittarius A* and see if it looks like a black hole. Making that image, of course, would be another long story indeed. Until they saw that first fringe, the Event Horizon team would simply have to hold their breaths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be months. All that data would be too much to send over the Internet. Nobody would know if the whole telescope had worked until the data recorded from each separate instrument had been correlated in a supercomputer back at M.I.T. As Dr. Doeleman liked to say, ''The bandwidth of a 747 loaded with disk drives is phenomenal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they are lucky, sometime later this summer or fall, then, they might see emerging from the computers at M.I.T. the first rough image of a black hole. And its size and shape could provide a judgment on general relativity, the harshest test yet a century after Einstein dreamed up the theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some theorists, breaking Einstein is the main game. ''The least exciting thing would be to find general relativity works beautifully,'' said Dr. Broderick, at the Perimeter Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Doeleman says he is also excited about what he likes to call the ''secret sauce'' of the Event Horizon Telescope: the chance to see inside the engine that produces the monstrous energies of quasars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can see a black hole eat in real time,'' he said. By following hot spots in the superhot gas swirling toward oblivion, they can even measure the rotation rate of the black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If something is dancing around the edge of the black hole, it doesn't get any more fundamental than that,'' Dr. Doeleman said. ''Hopefully we'll find something amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Plumbers' Blues</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first piece of Dr. Doeleman's spider silk to break was the radio telescope in Chile. Its receiver died and had to be sent back to Europe for repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That failure put more of an onus on the Mexican telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sierra Negra was a natural choice as the fulcrum of the Event Horizon Telescope. Not only is it centrally located, but the new Large Millimeter Telescope, with its giant dish designed for short wavelengths, is also the most sensitive radio telescope in the network. Completed in 2006 by the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics in Puebla state and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, at a cost of $116 million, it is the largest and most expensive scientific project in Mexico. Its inclusion in the Event Horizon Telescope was a point of great pride to its director, Dr. Hughes, who has spent the better part of the last decade getting the instrument up to snuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People want to bring their equipment and their experiments here now,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a dry run, however, the astronomers discovered that the telescope's new receiver was afflicted by a mysterious electrical buzz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomical history is replete with mysterious hisses and buzzes that turn out to be cosmic breakthroughs. One incident 50 years ago with two Bell Labs astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, turned out to be the signal of cooling radiation from the Big Bang itself, and resulted in a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this was not the cosmos calling. The hum did not interfere with the data, but it did interfere with pointing the antenna. Normally, to lock onto a radio source, the astronomers would rock the telescope back and forth to find the strongest signal, like a cross-country driver trying to tune into a distant <span class="companylink">Yankees</span> game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong sources like Jupiter still came booming through above the noise. But the buzz was louder than faint sources like Sagittarius A* at the galactic center, meaning that the astronomers could not be sure they were recording data from the right target. As a result, the Mexican telescope had to sit out the first official observing run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several days of troubleshooting failed to make the buzz go away. ''We're just plumbers here,'' Dr. Doeleman said one morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, the expert on the receiver, Gopal Narayanan of the University of Massachusetts, was called home for a family emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the astronomers did not solve the problem, they would be down to just four sites in the network. ''Every antenna is precious,'' Dr. Doeleman said, but the prolonged absence of the Large Millimeter Telescope could be crippling. Losing Mexico on top of Chile would leave the astronomers with less than half the information they had hoped for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're on a slippery slope,'' Dr. Doeleman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues hit on a plan. Unable to isolate the noise, they decided to see if they could use a less sensitive but quieter receiver to point the telescope, and then switch over to the new receiver to collect data. They could calibrate the pointing difference between the receivers by aiming each one in turn at a bright object like Saturn and measuring the offset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a lot of handwork,'' Dr. Doeleman said. ''Once you know the offset, you can lock in with a computer model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What do I feel about this project?'' Dr. Doeleman said that afternoon as the team was assembling to go back up to the telescope, raising his voice so everyone could hear. ''We're going to succeed. It's going to take a lot of innovation, but we have a good team to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Dr. Doeleman was not planning on being part of that team. He was scheduled to go home to his family the next morning, having already extended his stay in Mexico once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hughes urged him to stay, saying the team needed his leadership and expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing so would require an intense Skype conversation with his family, Dr. Doeleman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hughes replied that it should be an easy decision, given the scientific consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kid Stays in the Picture</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman packed his bags for the long ride to the airport. But in the morning, looking distraught, he announced he had changed his mind and would stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of his postdocs were new to observational astronomy, the Mexican scientists who had joined them were new to the Event Horizon procedures, and Dr. Narayanan, the receiver expert, was not back yet. The telescope's chances of helping to produce a black hole image were hanging in the balance. ''If we were going to have any chance of doing it, I had to stay,'' Dr. Doeleman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His reward was another night of snow in the dish, a real heartbreaker because for the first time, everything else was working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve hours later, the team made its third try. The atmosphere in the control room was almost giddy as the telescope swung into position, staring at the black hole in the fiery galaxy M87.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman, wearing a scarf knitted by his wife, typed into his laptop that the Large Millimeter Telescope was taking data. At last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a real moment,'' he told Dr. Narayanan, who had just returned from home. ''That's a real moment, Gopal. That's huge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're gonna image a black hole,'' he said, beaming. ''That's what we're here for. This is it. We're doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The connection established, they settled down to be bored -- but an hour later, the weather went bad and they had to stow the telescope to keep the snow out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before dawn, five long hours later, the weather cleared enough for the telescope to rejoin the network, now focused on the Milky Way center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Vertatschitsch, one of Dr. Doeleman's postdoctoral researchers at the Center for Astrophysics, said, ''My heart was beating a million miles a minute, and I was smiling from ear to ear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-fives were exchanged -- but two hours later, the sun had risen too high for them to continue. The black-hole party now became a race against time and weather. The next night, the Mexican telescope was shut out by the weather completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Doeleman put it later in an email, ''There were a couple of nights where the other sites were having an E.H.T. party and we were at home in PJs doing the crossword. Maddening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting Out of Dodge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doeleman did finally go home, satisfied that his team was in good shape to carry on, while he watched by laptop and Skype. Dr. Narayanan took apart the receiver and traced the troublesome noise to mechanical vibrations, which he treated with duct tape. After all, he said, duct tape had helped save Apollo 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, that was when things started working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were now down to their last official chance to spin the silk. The weather was not promising, Dr. Vertatschitsch said later by email, but they went up Sierra Negra anyway. They spent half the night going through their piggyback routine to point the telescope, writing computer code on the spot. ''It's hard to describe,'' she wrote, ''but there is an adrenaline that comes with this high-stakes problem-solving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they clicked with the Event Horizon Telescope for good, first for Virgo and then for Sagittarius, collecting data until dawn. Afterward, some of the astronomers ran out and took a selfie in front of the telescope, celebrating, Dr. Vertatschitsch said in an email, ''the sweat, the lack of sleep, the exhaustion and the pure joy of an experiment. It's the moments you live for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From afar, Dr. Doeleman had his own moment. ''I wasn't there,'' he said later. ''Sometimes, the best thing you can do is get out of Dodge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night marked the end of the Event Horizon Telescope's official observing run, but as it happened, there was an encore. California, Arizona and Mexico were available for an extra night. That, said Dr. Vertatschitsch, was the best night of all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the best weather we had seen all trip,'' she said. Dr. Narayanan's taped-up receiver was able to do the pointing by itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All I had to do was go,'' Dr. Doeleman said later. ''On the final two nights, the clouds parted. Everything comes out biblical in the Event Horizon Telescope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Sneak Peek</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks later, Dr. Doeleman, looking relaxed and 20 years younger, with his wife and two children in tow, traveled to New York to give a talk in the Hayden Planetarium at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>. He said in a separate conversation that some 200 terabytes of data -- about as much as is contained in the printed material in the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> -- were then on the way to M.I.T., the bandwidth of that metaphorical 747 in action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the 100th since Einstein presented his Theory of General Relativity, the calendar is chock-full of meetings and celebrations devoted to the theory. Perhaps during this yearlong party, astronomers may finally know if the dark shadow of eternity is smiling at us through the star clouds of Sagittarius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computers are already running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of April, an email went out to the Event Horizon collaboration, dense with graphs, the result of correlating the observations from one night between two mountains -- Sierra Negra and Mauna Kea, in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They showed striking signs of an interference pattern. The fringes were there. The spider silk had held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had no idea I could hold my breath that long!'' Dr. Doeleman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 16, 2015, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about efforts by scientists to take the first-ever picture of the black hole at the center of our galaxy by using a worldwide network of telescopes misstated, in some copies, a task that Sheperd Doeleman, the head of the project, once completed at the ALMA telescope array in Chile. He was testing atomic clocks, not installing receivers. And a chart with the article misidentified one of the telescopes in Hawaii that is part of the network. It is the Submillimeter Array, not the Small Millimeter Array.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It worked,'' said William Sanford Nye, chief executive of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization promoting space exploration that is operating and financing the project. Mr. Nye, who is better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, acknowledged the success did not come easily, calling it an ''emotional roller coaster.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, just after 2 p.m. Eastern time, a command was sent to the spacecraft to deploy the sail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For reasons not understood, LightSail ignored the command.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was despondent,'' Mr. Nye said. ''I was a little down. This mission has had me down many times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the next orbit, about two hours later -- the last chance for the day -- the team sent the command again. The electric motor that was to extend four 13-foot booms to pull out almost 345 square feet of Mylar started turning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the spacecraft passed out of radio range, the tiny motor had turned 67,000 times, halfway to the 134,200 needed to fully deploy the sail. ''There was no reason to expect it wouldn't keep going,'' Mr. Nye said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the spacecraft is to send down photographs to confirm that the sail is spread out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology, using sunlight to traverse the solar system in the same way mariners once crossed oceans in sailing ships, is not a new idea, but it has not been widely used.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LightSail, packed into a box about the size of a loaf of bread, was one of 10 payloads that last month hitchhiked on a rocket that took an unmanned <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> space plane into orbit.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight days of silence followed until, as engineers expected, a high-speed charged particle zipping through space fortuitously scrambled part of the computer's memory and caused the computer to restart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With communications re-established, the team began a two-step process of flipping up the solar panels, then extending the sail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the solar panels were put in position, the spacecraft appeared to suffer a battery problem, and it fell out of touch for a second time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Spencer, a professor at the <span class="companylink">Georgia Institute of Technology</span> who is the mission manager, said the problem might have been caused by a surge in electrical current when the spacecraft passed from shadow to sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday afternoon, the team again made contact with LightSail, and moved quickly to execute the deployment of the sail before anything else could go wrong. The mission should now come to a quick end, probably in two to 10 days.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LightSail team does not have access to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s worldwide network of radio telescopes but instead relies on two ground stations, at California State Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo and at the <span class="companylink">Georgia Institute of Technology</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the problem may be caused by a surge in electrical current when the spacecraft passes from shadow to sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With LightSail working again, the engineers want to deploy the sail -- extending four 13-foot booms and then stretching out 345 square feet of Mylar -- as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Spencer said the first opportunity would be around 2 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, when the craft is in contact with a ground station and when it is in sunlight and can thus draw power from the solar panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team would go ahead with deployment even if the batteries were offline again. ''That would be a riskier operation,'' Professor Spencer said, as the maneuver had not been tested on the ground.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers are troubleshooting what they suspect is a battery glitch that occurred after the spacecraft popped out its solar panels on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, David Spencer, director of the Center for Space Systems at the <span class="companylink">Georgia Institute of Technology</span> and manager of this mission, thinks they will hear from LightSail again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a high level of confidence,'' he said. ''I think we will recover the spacecraft. You know, it's nail-biting time. Flying spacecraft is hard. Nothing has been easy on this mission in particular, but we've shown we're able to work through difficult problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a week ago, the project seemed a multimillion-dollar flop after the spacecraft's computer crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LightSail, and nine other tiny satellites known as CubeSats, hitched a ride to space on May 20 on a rocket carrying a classified Air Force space plane to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the CubeSats were cast off, LightSail operated as expected, sending back data for two days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then it went quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A software flaw had caused a file of telemetry data to grow without bound. When that part of its memory filled up, the computer crashed, with no one around to press the restart button.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LightSail's systems had been tested on the ground, but not quite long enough to turn up the computer bug, which occurred after about 40 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the problem arose in space, where high-energy particles like protons from the sun and cosmic rays from distant supernovas whiz around all the time. Usually they are a nuisance to space missions, garbling computer data and calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in this case, engineers expected that a high-energy particle would jolt LightSail's memory, causing it to restart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After eight days, that is what happened, and a radio chirp was detected at the ground station at California State Polytechnic University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Jubilation was my response,'' said Barbara Plante, the lead software engineer and the president of Boreal Space, a contractor involved with the project. ''We were all monitoring the pass when the data came in. It was quite a relief. That just felt like the mission was going to go forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prevent the problem from recurring, the team is restarting LightSail's computer about once a day. The team also decided to accelerate deployment of the solar sail -- four large triangular pieces of Mylar stretched out between four 13-foot booms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first step was flipping up the solar panels. As expected, the rotation of the spacecraft slowed, and temperature of the panels, exposed to the vacuum of space, dropped. ''We believe the panels successfully deployed,'' Professor Spencer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the battery problem, the team deferred taking a picture of the extended solar panels. As with the earlier computer trouble, the engineering team, which includes students at <span class="companylink">Georgia Tech</span> and Cal Poly, will work through what went wrong, try to coax the spacecraft back to life and wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If contact is re-established, the team is likely to deploy the sail as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That in turn would bring the mission to a quick end, and the spacecraft would fall out of the sky within days. LightSail's elliptical orbit is just 217 miles above the surface at the low point, and the atmospheric drag will be greater than the momentum of photons bouncing off the sail. But by then the team would have pronounced the mission a success. This flight was meant to work through hardware and software issues before a second LightSail is launched next year to an orbit high enough to demonstrate sailing using sunlight rather than fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the troubles that this LightSail has encountered can be readily corrected on the second LightSail before launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Sanford Nye, the chief executive of the Planetary Society, who is better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, said he thought the engineers would figure out how to get the sail deployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very confident now,'' Mr. Nye said before immediately switching his answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No, I'm not,'' he said. ''I'm 50-50. I think they'll solve the problem, but I would not bet a million dollars on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, ''That's exactly why we flew this first mission.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- After Russia annexed Crimea last year, Congress passed legislation that forced the Pentagon to stop buying Russian rocket engines that have been used since 2000 to help launch American military and intelligence satellites into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, that simple act of punishment is proving difficult to keep in place.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only five months after the ban became law, the Pentagon is pressing Congress to ease it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon says that additional Russian engines will be needed for at least a few more years to ensure access to space for the country's most delicate defense and intelligence technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retreat has angered Russia's fiercest critics in Congress, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He said that NPO Energomash, the Russian company that makes the rockets and has close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin, stood to make $300 million from sales that would otherwise come to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ban applies only to national security missions, but the Pentagon's request has also frustrated those who have pressed to end American reliance on Russia for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and commercial spaceflights, at a time when relations between the two countries have become tenser than in any other period since the Cold War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know what the Pentagon's position can be, except for them and the Obama administration trying to placate Putin,'' Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and a member of the <span class="companylink">House Armed Services Committee</span>, said. He predicted that the legislative fight would intensify in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Can you imagine the space race using Russian rockets?'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon's position, however, has powerful support from the nation's intelligence chief and two of the most influential defense contractors, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>. And it appears to be prevailing, even as the United States has imposed a raft of financial and travel sanctions against Russian officials, including those overseeing that country's defense industry, in order to deter further aggression by Mr. Putin in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to senior lawmakers dated May 11, the secretary of defense, Ashton B. Carter, and the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said the Pentagon would face ''significant challenges'' to ensuring access to space for the most delicate military and intelligence missions if the ban on the Russian engines remained in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the House passed its annual defense authorization bill, it approved language that would ease the ban. The <span class="companylink">Senate Armed Services Committee</span> recommended a compromise that would allow the company that uses the Russian rockets, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> called the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, to continue to bid for additional launches through at least the rest of this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate is an example of the seismic shift in relations between the United States and Russia, ending a quarter century of tentative and sometimes strained efforts to cooperate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reliance on Russian rockets for national security missions -- the ones that place top-secret surveillance and communications satellites in orbit -- is a remnant of the ''peace dividend'' that followed the Cold War. That era has now given way to one of political and military provocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energomash, the Russian company that makes the rocket engines, emerged from the old Soviet space program and formed a partnership with <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> in the early 1990s to develop new technologies. It was a time when the United States sought to foster cooperation in space, in part to discourage the proliferation of rocket technology to countries that American officials viewed warily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and <span class="companylink">Pratt &amp; Whitney</span>, Energomash adapted the RD-180 rocket engine for use in the Atlas series of rockets now made by the <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>-<span class="companylink">Boeing</span> alliance. The engine has been used in 54 launches of the latest version, the Atlas V, for commercial, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and military missions. In a statement, the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> called the RD-180 ''a technologically advanced and reliable engine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangement attracted opposition because of Energomash's majority state ownership and, according to an article by Reuters last year, a minority share tied to one of Mr. Putin's closest friends, the billionaire Yuri V. Kovalchuk. The invasion of Crimea and Russia's support for the armed uprising in eastern Ukraine prompted overwhelming support in Congress last year for ending the use of the RD-180 for military and intelligence missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly we cannot have Vladimir Putin and his cronies profit from the sale of rocket engines,'' Mr. McCain said at a news conference last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon and the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> agree on the need for rockets that are made in the United States. In testimony before the Senate in April, the secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee James, said the invasion of Crimea ''made it abundantly clear to all of us that we have to stop relying on Russian engines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she also said that halting any new purchases made after the invasion of Crimea, as the law now requires, could leave the Air Force without a viable engine for the Atlas after 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ending the reliance on the RD-180 ''is not as simple as it appears,'' said David A. Deptula, a retired Air Force general who runs the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Arlington, Va. He said ''underinvestment, lack of a clear vision and stifling bureaucracy'' had slowed innovation of alternatives for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We must always remember that this nation went to the moon in less than a decade,'' he wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over the Russian engines has become entangled in an emerging rivalry among the companies vying for the lucrative business of space launches, amounting to $70 billion in contracts for military and intelligence missions alone between now and 2030, according to an estimate cited by the <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, formed in 2006, has a monopoly on military and intelligence contracts, but it faces competition from <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, founded by Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and Tesla. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has developed its own rocket, called the Falcon 9, which has carried out 18 successful missions for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and private companies, including the first private resupply of the International Space Station. After months of review, negotiations and a lawsuit that was settled last year, the Air Force last month certified the Falcon 9 for use in national security missions, ending <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>'s monopoly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ms. James, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> can now compete for two launches scheduled this year and seven more planned for the next two years. The Air Force announced this week that it had opened bidding on the first of those, with applications due by June 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has argued that its rockets can carry out the launches at a lower cost than the two used by the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, the Atlas V and the Delta IV. In a written statement, Mr. Musk called the certification ''an important step toward bringing competition'' to national security missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> has pledged to build a new rocket, called the Vulcan, without using the Russian engine, but its first test is not scheduled until 2019 and its certification is not expected until 2022. In their letter, Mr. Carter and Mr. Clapper said the ban on new acquisitions of the Russian engines would mean that the alliance could soon exhaust its supply of Atlas V rockets, leaving only the more expensive Delta IV, which is being phased out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate now is over how many more missions the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> should be allowed to conduct with the Russian engines. The company has ordered 29 engines, 15 of which are paid for and planned for use. The Pentagon wants the company to be able to use the rest. The House legislation would do that, while the Senate version would allow the alliance to buy more engines only if it wins bids, presumably against <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the ban remains, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> could end up as the sole company able to bid for some launches in the coming years. That would recreate the monopoly that the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> enjoyed and that the Pentagon, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and others have sought to end. Mr. Carter and Mr. Clapper said they wanted to maintain ''an environment where price-based competition is possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the Pentagon's efforts said that with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s certification, the argument for continuing to use the Russian engine was little more than a concession to <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> -- and one that ultimately would provide benefits to Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of our biggest defense companies are lobbying on behalf of the Russians,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''That's a strange position for the defense industry to have.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five moons of Pluto form a sort of miniature planetary system -- one that is unique in the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest, Charon, 750 miles wide, was discovered in 1978, and it is so large, about one-ninth the mass of Pluto, that the center of mass of the two lies outside Pluto. That has led some planetary scientists to regard Pluto and Charon as a double planet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, Earth is 81 times the mass of the moon, and the center of mass is within Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two much smaller moons of Pluto, now named Nix and Hydra, were discovered in 2005 in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. In 2011, another moon, Kerberos, was discovered between the orbits of Nix and Hydra, and a year later, astronomers announced the fifth moon, Styx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an article published Wednesday in the journal Nature, Mark R. Showalter of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., and Douglas P. Hamilton of the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> calculated more precisely the orbits of the four smaller moons and turned up some surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, Nix, jostled by the competing gravitational pulls of Pluto and Charon, appears to be rotating chaotically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just a little bit chaotic,'' Dr. Showalter said. ''Nix can flip its entire pole. It could actually be possible to spend a day on Nix in which the sun rises in the east and sets in the north. It is almost random-looking in the way it rotates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Showalter said that Styx and Kerberos were probably also rotating chaotically. ''It's just that we haven't been able to measure them well enough to see it yet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hydra, the farthest from Pluto, is also tumbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It just shows the universe is a really complex and wonderful place,'' said Scott J. Kenyon, an astrophysicist at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> in Cambridge, Mass., who wrote an accompanying commentary in Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings in Nature are based on Hubble images taken from 2005 to 2012 and include detections of Kerberos and Styx in older photographs where astronomers had previously missed seeing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft, speeding toward a close encounter with Pluto on July 14, may help answer many questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbits of the five moons are close, but not exactly in resonance, in which gravity would keep the moons moving in lockstep. Styx's orbital period is close to three times that of Charon, Nix's is close to four times, Kerberos's is close to five and Hydra's is close to six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is not exact, which means it is actually not a resonance at all,'' Dr. Showalter said. ''Resonance is not like a game of horseshoes, where close counts. You're either in a resonance or you're not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the orbits are so close that they strongly suggest that the moons were once in resonance. ''This is not random chance,'' Dr. Showalter said. ''There is definitely something about the nature of these near relationships that is a clue about how this system formed and evolved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Showalter and Dr. Hamilton discovered a different resonance, in which Styx's motion is locked to those of Nix and Hydra. The two resonances cannot occur simultaneously, so somehow the original resonance of the five moons fell apart and then three of the moons synchronized in the second one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refined estimates of the properties of the moons also indicate that Kerberos has one-third the mass of Hydra and yet reflects only one-twentieth as much sunlight. That would mean it is made of something much darker, like coal, than Nix and Hydra, which have the brightness of dirty snow or desert sand. ''We are totally mystified by the color of Kerberos,'' Dr. Showalter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers estimated that Hydra is a potato-shaped object about 36 miles wide, and Nix is 35 miles wide and a bit skinnier. Kerberos is about 19 miles wide, they said. In the Hubble images, Styx was too small and dim for astronomers to estimate its size and reflectivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto and its moons are believed to have formed out of a collision of icy bodies in the outer solar system. One idea is that the brighter moons coalesced out of the debris, while the darker Kerberos might be a fragment of the object that slammed into Pluto.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nine years that <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft has spent zooming toward Pluto, most of the seven instruments aboard the piano-size probe have been in hibernation, waiting for their chance to plumb the mysteries of our solar system. One, however, has been collecting and pinging back data all this time, a tireless worker with a taste for dust.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instrument, known as the Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter, was created at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado, Boulder</span>, by a small group of students in physics, mechanical engineering, aeronautics and astrophysical sciences. At the time of launch, it was the only student-led instrument on any interplanetary mission, and it has gone farther from Earth than any other. Its purpose aboard New Horizons is to measure the amount and density of space dust encountered on the journey to the dwarf planet, analyzing the remnants of colliding objects like asteroids, comets and expired planets. With this information, scientists will be able to understand more about activity in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris just beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instrument was first proposed by Mihaly Horanyi, a physics professor at the university, as part of the school's pitch to <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to piggyback on a mission to Pluto. While the university's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, where Dr. Horanyi is a research associate, was not chosen to lead the mission, New Horizons' eventual principal investigator, Alan Stern, from the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>, wanted a dust instrument on the spacecraft. So Dr. Horanyi put in a second proposal, this time for an instrument built and run entirely by students, and in 2003 <span class="companylink">NASA</span> approved the Student Dust Counter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a strong scientific rationale to have a dust instrument onboard,'' Dr. Horanyi said. ''Dust measurements beyond Pluto will give estimates on the density and size distributions of the Kuiper Belt objects. These measurements are critical to compare our own dust disk -- the Zodiacal dust cloud -- to the dust disks observed around many other stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project started with three students Dr. Horanyi had recruited from his own faculty. Soon, word spread around campus that a professor was looking for students to work on a <span class="companylink">NASA</span>-led mission to Pluto. ''In a matter of months, we had 20 or so students on the team,'' Dr. Horanyi said. Though it was an academic project, the Student Dust Counter had to adhere to the same <span class="companylink">NASA</span> standards as the other instruments on New Horizons, which meant regular reviews in front of panels of visiting <span class="companylink">NASA</span> engineers. (Dr. Horanyi remembers it more as an ''interrogation.'') In the two years it took to build the dust counter, many students graduated and moved on, replaced by a new batch of undergraduates. Of the original team, four students are still at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado, Boulder</span>, in some capacity; two graduated, but eventually returned to work on the Student Dust Counter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany Finley came onboard as the project manager in 2002, while she was a graduate student. She was responsible for seeing the instrument all the way through, from design to construction to calibration. ''I'd just been looking for something cool to work on, and suddenly it was like, wait, you guys are going to Pluto? Sign me up,'' she said. After graduating, Ms. Finley worked as an aerospace engineer before landing a job at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>, first with the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> Juno mission to Jupiter and then with New Horizons. She is now responsible for command sequencing on the Student Dust Counter -- creating a series of orders that tell the instrument what to do and when to do it. (Dr. Horanyi joked that Ms. Finley started out as his student and is now his boss.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, David James began work on the dust counter in 2003 for his physics Ph.D., with Dr. Horanyi as his adviser. His work looked at the polyvinylidene fluoride detectors that make up the dust counter, which generate a charge when hit with a dust particle. The detectors are composed of a plastic film and coated with a thin layer of metal; when a dust particle hits the detectors, the charges rearrange themselves, creating an electronic signal. The Student Dust Counter measures this signal and sends the information back to Earth for analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. James, too, left the university for a few years after graduating, but returned after realizing that the dust counter was a unique opportunity. ''New Horizons is one of the greatest missions in space history,'' Dr. James said. ''To continue to be part of that, especially on a project you started working on as a student, is too exciting to pass up.'' Dr. James is now overseeing the latest batch of Colorado students recruited to work with the instrument as New Horizons gears up for its flyby of Pluto in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. James and Ms. Finley have fond memories of summers spent in the lab working on the dust counter, despite the sleepless nights spent worrying about the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> review panels. Dr. James recalls one long week testing the instrument in various temperatures to make sure it could survive the journey to Pluto. The students worked in 24-hour shifts, juggling classes and other obligations, to document the procedure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were driven by the knowledge that if our little instrument broke while up in space, it would damage the entire craft and put the whole mission in jeopardy,'' Dr. James said. ''We were solving problems students aren't normally required to solve, and that proved to be invaluable experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Horanyi and his team have been steadily collecting data from the Student Dust Counter during its nine-year trip, publishing a number of research papers. However, the dust counter's big moment is yet to come. After the Pluto flyby, New Horizons is scheduled to keep flying away from the sun, with enough power to continue comfortably for another 20 to 25 years, exploring unfamiliar parts of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you were an alien world looking into our solar system and saw all the dust, what you'd really be looking at is the footprints of our planets,'' Dr. James said. ''Similarly, if we look at other solar systems, we can do the same. That's why these tiny particles of dust are so important. They can tell us what used to be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Dr. Stern at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> organized a reunion for the 30 or so students who had worked on the Student Dust Counter. For Dr. Horanyi, it was an emotional moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's 14 years' worth of people on the same project,'' he said. ''To see that so many people still care deeply about it was an incredible thing to witness.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazingly enough, Kennedy's nearly surreal vision was achieved right on schedule, on July 20, 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin setting foot on the dusty surface of the moon's Sea of Tranquillity and later returning safely to Earth, a feat that Norman Mailer would compare to the voyages of Columbus and Magellan, and to Hannibal crossing the Alps with his legions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last moon landing, however, was made in 1972; and the last space shuttle flight came home in July 2011 amid fears that a rapidly downsizing <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, afflicted by budget cuts and a brain drain, could no longer capture the public imagination. In her wonderfully evocative new book ''Leaving Orbit,'' Margaret Lazarus Dean sets out to chronicle ''the beauty and the strangeness in the last days of American spaceflight, in the last moments of something that used to be cited as what makes America great.'' Though she overstates the end-times nature of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s future -- skimming lightly over its Mars exploration projects and other plans in a highly cursory epilogue -- Ms. Dean writes with the passion of a lifelong lover of space exploration and an ability to communicate, with tremendous kinetic power, the glory and danger of its missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She retraces the ''heroic era'' of spaceflight (1961-1972) and maps the less glamorous but still crucial achievements of the shuttle era, arguing that of the ''four warring interests in spaceflight,'' ''ambitiousness of vision'' and ''urgency of timetable'' prevailed early on, giving way increasingly to ''reduction of cost, and safety to astronauts.'' The personality traits <span class="companylink">NASA</span> looks for in astronauts also changed, she argues: Whereas the agency focused on military pilots in the 1960s -- the sort of swaggering loner cowboys in ''The Right Stuff'' -- it now employs scientists, researchers, doctors: team players, in the words of one current astronaut, who are able to get along and ''handle their own weaknesses'' in extreme environments like the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dean is an associate professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Tennessee</span> who teaches a creative nonfiction course featuring the work of writers like Joan Didion, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson and Norman Mailer. Her book is very much haunted by two seminal works of New Journalism: Mr. Mailer's ''Of a Fire on the Moon'' (1970) and Tom Wolfe's ''The Right Stuff'' (1979). Mr. Mailer, she writes, thought he was witnessing the start of something, but was actually seeing its pinnacle; her book is meant as a kind of bookend to his -- a story of endings and a winding down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, Ms. Dean overdoes the Mailer references, comparing her observations about <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to those he once made, her point of view to his. Her repeated taking of her own emotional temperature grows increasingly mannered as the book progresses -- and imitative of Mr. Mailer's in a way that serves only to underscore his original and utterly distinctive vision and voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Dean simply lets her own love for spaceflight shine through, however, the result is a heartfelt paean to, and elegy for, a remarkable collective undertaking. She captures both the science and poetry of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s missions, and the romance of space travel, which dates back centuries, and was imagined in fiction like Jules Verne's 1865 classic ''From the Earth to the Moon.'' (In the early 20th century, she says, the Verne novel provided inspiration for three men working independently in three different countries, developing similar ideas about using rockets for space travel.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dean conveys the different personalities of various shuttle orbiters: the oldest, Columbia, she says, was a bit heavier than the others and somehow seemed like ''a chunky older sister,'' while Challenger struck her as some ''kind of mammal -- maybe a sweet and solid dog of unpretentious pedigree.'' She introduces us to dedicated <span class="companylink">NASA</span> employees like Omar Izquierdo, a second-generation <span class="companylink">NASA</span> worker who plays Virgil to her Dante, guiding her through the maze of the Kennedy Space Center, as well as to avid space fans who regularly congregate in the mosquito-plagued environs to witness each shuttle launch. And she commemorates the touching idealism embodied in the plaque that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left on the moon: ''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enshrined in these pages is the fierce magic of a shuttle's launching -- the nearly painful brightness, the earthshaking rumble, the slow and then faster escape from gravity. And the almost equally extraordinary spectacle of its return to Earth, heralded by the roar of a double sonic boom and then the sight of the winged craft, gliding out of the sky, ''ghostly trails'' coming off the tips of its wings and its tail fin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of ''Leaving Orbit,'' Ms. Dean has come to the melancholy conclusion that ''there was never enthusiastic public support for human spaceflight for its own sake,'' but at best, ''support for beating the Soviets at a game'' that ''seemed to have to do with military, not scientific, superiority'': ''People said they didn't want to go to bed under a Soviet moon.'' The ''power of that brief interest,'' along with the successes of the heroic era, she contends, ''has been enough to fuel 50 years of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>,'' but ''those of us who love it'' should ''accept the fact that it's finally run its course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too early to write an epitaph for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and its underfunded yet ambitious plans, but then, as a Joan Didion epigraph Ms. Dean has chosen for this book reads: ''It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy, indeed, to be excited about the scientific and technological prowess of American companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple, <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>, <span class="companylink">3M</span> -- American businesses dominate the list of the most innovative companies in the world. And new companies trumpeting new products, financed by dynamic venture capital operations, continue to emerge from Silicon Valley, the Boston region, New York, Northern Virginia and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But talk to a scientist in a research lab almost anywhere and you are likely to hear that the edifice of American innovation rests on an increasingly rickety foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment in research and development has flatlined over the last several years as a share of the economy, stabilizing at about 2.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2012, according to the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not be far from the overall peak. But other countries are now leaving the United States behind. And even more critically, investment in basic research -- the fundamental building block for innovation and economic advancement -- steadily shrank as a share of the economy in the decade to 2012, the last year for which there are comprehensive statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend poses two big challenges. The first concerns government budgets for basic research, the biggest source of financing for scientific inquiry. It fell in 2013 to substantially below its level 10 years earlier and, as one of the most politically vulnerable elements in an increasingly straitened federal budget, looks likely to shrink further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second, equally important, challenge regards the future of corporate research. Evidence suggests that American corporations, constantly pressured to increase the next quarter's profits in the face of powerful foreign competition, are walking away from basic science, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Companies' R&amp;D,'' Ashish Arora of Duke University's Fuqua School of Business told me, ''is moving away from the R toward the D.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bodes ill for American progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of American patent applications keeps rising. Yet increasingly divorced from the scientific advances on which technological progress ultimately rests, the patenting rush looks less and less like fundamental innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A research paper by Professor Arora and Sharon Belenzon from Fuqua, and Andrea Patacconi of the Norwich Business School at the <span class="companylink">University of East Anglia</span>, tracks American corporations' loss of interest in scientific research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The R&amp;D of publicly held companies increased to 2 percent of sales in 2007 from 1 percent of sales in 1980. The share of businesses holding patents increased to just less than 30 percent from 20 percent during the period. Yet the share of companies whose researchers published in scientific journals shrank. Publishing original research took a much-diminished role in corporations' overall R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American corporate labs are the stuff of legend. Researchers dream of the halcyon days of <span class="companylink">Bell Labs</span> and its eight Nobel Prize winners, who brought us the transistor and Unix. Others reminisce about <span class="companylink">Xerox</span><span class="companylink">PARC</span>, which came up with the graphical user interface that propelled the personal computer into just about every home and office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those days are long gone. Today, laments Mark Muro of the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>, investment in innovation has been balkanized, split between government financed basic research, squeezed by skimpy budgets, and a corporate R&amp;D effort constrained by its focus on the very short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened? The researchers at Duke and East Anglia reject the argument that tightening regulations have pushed companies to cut their research budgets. Corporate investment in basic research, they note, is waning in Europe, too. This is not exclusively an American dynamic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also doubt that science has somehow become less valuable, an argument proposed by prominent economists like Robert Gordon of <span class="companylink">Northwestern University</span>. Citations of recent scientific research are as common in corporate patents today as they were in the 1980s, suggesting science remains critical to companies' innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, something has clearly changed: Investors may value corporate patents as much as ever, but the stock market places a lower valuation on original research than it did three decades ago. Corporate executives, their compensation tied overwhelmingly to short-term gains in the market value of their companies, may be responding accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science has always been risky. <span class="companylink">Xerox</span> was not the main beneficiary of the graphical user interface. Apple and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> were. <span class="companylink">Bell Labs</span> might not have poured much money into discovering cosmic microwave background radiation without the backing of a deep-pocketed telephone monopoly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harassed by international competition in our more cutthroat era, companies have less incentive to create knowledge that may or may not be profitable. Instead, they are encouraged to patent more intensely, to protect what profitable knowledge they already have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can innovation survive this realignment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately a dearth of research threatens productivity growth, which slowed sharply over the last decade to less than half the average of the previous 10 years. It leaves young scientists in the lurch, without projects on which to apply their knowledge. It discourages young Americans from pursuing scientific careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional efforts to bolster corporate research by making the R&amp;D tax credit permanent are unlikely to help much. Already extended umpteen times since it came into being in 1981, the credit ''delivered, at most, a modest stimulus to domestic business R&amp;D investment from 2000 to 2010,'' according to the <span class="companylink">Congressional Research Service</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress might do better by getting out of the way. Efforts by congressional Republicans to reshape federal research policy through the reauthorization of the America Competes Act, reducing funding in crucial areas like climate change and geoscience, among other provisions, could do real damage to the nation's research effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As large companies have cut their research budgets, small, science-driven businesses have stepped in to pick up some of the slack, spawned by the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 that encouraged scientists and universities to commercialize the discoveries they made on the federal dime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have opened a path for corporate innovation. Rather than invest in their own science, big companies may now more easily buy innovative start-ups and develop their most promising discoveries into profitable technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet this ecosystem is vulnerable, reliant on a dwindling pot of public money that underwrites most university-based research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The buy-up strategy would be fine if we had confidence that the university system and start-ups were picking up the slack,'' Professor Arora told me. ''But we still don't understand how this division of innovative labor would work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might work. But it looks risky to put all our trust in that approach. It's time for a different paradigm -- more on that in a future column -- to finance the innovation that will power America's future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with the previous flights, the Air Force revealed few details about what the unmanned X-37B spacecraft, which resembles a smaller version of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s retired space shuttles, will be doing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The test mission furthers the development of the concept of operations for reusable space vehicles, and fine-tunes technical parameters for an affordable, reusable space vehicle,'' said Capt. Christopher M. Hoyler, a spokesman for the Air Force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has built two X-37B spacecraft for the Air Force. The first launched in April 2010, setting off speculation over the vessel's purposes. Some suggested that the craft had something to do with space weapons, which the Pentagon denied. It landed in December that year. The second orbiter was sent up from March 2011 to June 2012. The first craft made a second flight, launching in December 2012 and returning 674 days later, in October 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force was not saying which of the two was packed inside an Atlas 5 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are excited about our fourth X-37B mission,'' Randy Walden, the director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, said in a statement released last month. ''With the demonstrated success of the first three missions, we're able to shift our focus from initial checkouts of the vehicle to testing of experimental payloads.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-hour launch window opens at 10:45 a.m. on Wednesday. Forecasts indicated a 60 percent chance of favorable weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the experiments the Air Force has talked about is an improved version of an electric thruster. Unlike conventional thrusters employing chemical reactions, electric thrusters are more efficient, accelerating charged ions through electric fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electric thrusters are common on commercial satellites, but the Air Force needs more powerful propulsion. <span class="companylink">Aerojet Rocketdyne</span> has built thrusters for three military satellites that run at 5 kilowatts, or about four times the power of those on commercial satellites. The thruster on the X-37B is a modified version, intended to improve performance, although it still generates less than a tenth of a pound of thrust. ''But it does it very, very efficiently from a fuel standpoint,'' said Fred C. Wilson, director of business development at <span class="companylink">Aerojet Rocketdyne</span>. ''It's a higher-power, higher-performance device.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>, which collaborated on the development of the thruster, hopes that similar technology can be used to propel cargo ships to Mars, part of an eventual mission to send astronauts there. Last month, the space agency selected <span class="companylink">Aerojet Rocketdyne</span> to develop and test a 100-kilowatt electric thruster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> is also taking advantage of this X-37B flight to test how almost 100 materials react to the harsh conditions of space, like the barrage of radiation and swings of temperature the craft will experience while passing between the day and night sides of the Earth for at least 200 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just sitting there and letting the environment hit it,'' said Miria Finckenor, a materials engineer at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. She is the principal investigator for the experiment, which is housed in the space plane's cargo bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The materials to be tested include thermal coatings to keep spacecraft components within a certain range of temperatures, clear materials under consideration for lighter windows on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Orion crew capsule and ink to make sure that markings on parts do not fade away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> previously tested more than 4,000 samples outside the International Space Station, but it is difficult to carve out time during spacewalks to set up and retrieve the experiments. ''This opportunity presented itself, and we just needed to take advantage of it,'' Ms. Finckenor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information gleaned from such experiments helps engineers choose materials for spacecraft components like antennas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the space plane, the Atlas 5 rocket will give 10 tiny satellites known as CubeSats a ride to space. The CubeSats will be deployed to test technologies like new propulsion and communication systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the CubeSats is LightSail, developed by the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>, a nonprofit that promotes space exploration. On launching, it is about the size of a loaf of bread, but after a month of testing, it is to deploy four 13-foot booms and unfurl four triangular pieces of Mylar to act as a sail, propelled by sunlight. For this test flight, the orbit will be too low for the force of photons to overcome atmospheric drag, and the satellite is expected to fall out of the sky within a few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second LightSail, scheduled to lift off next year on a Falcon Heavy rocket from <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, is to be sent high enough to demonstrate controlled solar sailing in orbit. The second LightSail is already built, but the society is raising additional money through a Kickstarter campaign for education and promotion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Interfax agency quoted an unidentified official at <span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span>, the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span>, as saying there had been an ''emergency engine shutdown of the third stage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proton rocket is the mainstay transporter for International Launch Services, a joint Russian-American satellite carrier business. The satellite, called Centenario, was being sent into orbit on behalf of Mexico's Ministry of Communications and Transportation and had been manufactured by <span class="companylink">Boeing Satellite Systems</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a statement issued by International Launch Services before the launching, it was intended to provide ''mobile satellite services to support national security, civil and humanitarian efforts and will provide disaster relief, emergency services, telemedicine, rural education and government agency operations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proton-M is regarded as a workhorse but has encountered numerous problems in its decades of service. In 2013, a leadership shake-up at <span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span> was prompted in part by the fourth failed launch of a Proton-M rocket within three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said further launchings would be suspended until the cause of Saturday's crash was determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mexican ministry said International Launch Services would create a commission to investigate the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It said the satellite loss was ''100 percent'' covered by insurance, a point that seemed aimed at a domestic population often skeptical of the government's spending on big projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry said it still planned to launch another communications satellite from Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard a <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> rocket in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, the transportation and communications secretary, said that the lost satellite and its launching were valued at $390 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I regret the mission was not a success,'' Mr. Esparza said. ''If Mexico is joining in these high technologies, we are going to have to learn to live with the risks that are not uncommon in this industry. The benefit is not so much being in the space era so much as the service it could provide to Mexicans.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The galaxy, more than a few billion light-years on the other side of the northern constellation Boötes, is one of the most massive and brightest in the early universe and goes by the name of EGS-zs8-1. It flowered into stardom only 670 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The light from that galaxy has taken 13 billion years to reach telescopes on Earth. By now, however, since the universe has continued to expand during that time, the galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away, according to standard cosmological calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new measurements allow astronomers to see the galaxy in its infancy. Despite its relative youth, however, it is already about one-sixth as massive as the Milky Way, which is 10 billion years old. And it is getting bigger, making stars 80 times faster than the Milky Way is making them today. The discovery was reported in The Astrophysical Journal by Pascal Oesch of <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the rules of the expanding universe, the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is retreating from us, measured by the ''redshift'' of its light being broadened to longer wavelengths, the way an ambulance siren seems to lower its pitch as it goes by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, as astronomers have raced one another into the past with instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope, galaxies have been found that appear even more distant. Those measurements, however, were estimates based on the colors of the objects -- so-called photometric redshifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new galaxy stuck out in a survey of distant galaxies by the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes known as Candels, for Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. Its redshift was precisely measured with a powerful spectrograph known as Mosfire -- Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infrared Exploration -- on Keck 1, one of a pair of 10-meter-diameter telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. That makes it the highest redshift confirmed in this way, said Garth Illingworth, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, one of the astronomers in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How galaxies were able to form and grow so rapidly after the lights came on in the universe is a mystery that will be addressed by a coming generation of instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope, a goliath planned for Mauna Kea, already home to a dozen telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however, construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, a $1.4 billion project, has been halted by protests by Hawaii residents who feel their mountain has been abused. An echo of that controversy appears in the new paper, in which Dr. Oesch and his colleagues write: ''The authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Mauna Kea has always had within the indigenous Hawaiian community. We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROME -- Samantha Cristoforetti had an espresso on Sunday that was out of this world, and she did it in the name of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cristoforetti is an astronaut, the seventh Italian and the first Italian woman to venture into orbit. She has been at the International Space Station since November, and over the weekend she got to do something quintessentially Italian: She became the first person to drink an authentic serving of what she called ''the finest organic suspension ever devised'' in space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fresh espresso in the new Zero-G cup! To boldly brew ... '' she posted on social media, where she has been chronicling her stay on the station with photos and explanatory videos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However much she may have enjoyed her first espresso in more than five months, making the drink in orbit was no lark, but ''a very serious study in fluid physics,'' Roberto Battiston, president of ASI, the Italian space agency, wrote in an emailed statement. ''Until Sunday, we didn't know exactly how hot fluids under high pressure reacted'' in the near-weightless environment of the space station, he said. ''Now we do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A special espresso maker, named ISSpresso, was designed for the task by Argotec, an engineering and software firm based in Turin, and the Italian coffee producer Lavazza, with help from the space agency. It was included among the experiments and technical demonstrations that Ms. Cristoforetti, a captain in the Italian Air Force, was scheduled to carry out on her mission to the station, which ends in mid-May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Coffee represents one of the distinctive elements of Italian culture,'' said a spokeswoman for the agency, who requested anonymity under her agency's rules for employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making a proper espresso -- a singular alchemy of high temperature, water pressure and perfectly tamped coffee -- is difficult enough to master on earth. Microgravity conditions made the task still more complicated, and Argotec took two years to work out how to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We developed our hardware on the basis of the parameters for making good coffee, while considering safety requirements,'' said Valerio Di Tana, an engineer at the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squat, 44-pound machine wound up looking something like an old-fashioned laboratory incubator, built from military-standard components. ''You don't see those on terrestrial machines,'' Mr. Di Tana said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dripless system is even designed to emit a small waft of coffee odor when the straw is inserted into the pouch containing the brew. Two small flaps on the side allow an astronaut to hold it without burning a hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important part of the espresso-in-space experience is the newly developed microgravity coffee cup, which allows astronauts to sip liquids more or less the way they would use a cup on earth. It does not have an open top that would allow spills, though; instead, the liquid reaches the astronaut's lips by capillary action -- ''almost like the wicking of water through a paper towel,'' a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> blog post explains. The cup also provides data on the passive movement of complex fluids in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISSpresso machine makes other hot drinks as well, including tea and consommé. ''This is important from the nutritional aspect, but also gives the astronauts a psychological boost,'' David Avino, the managing director of Argotec, said in a telephone interview on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had already begun the project when another Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, remarked in a June 2013 interview from the space station that the one thing he really missed in space ''was a good cup of espresso.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 321 pp. <span class="companylink">W. W. Norton &amp; Company</span>. $27.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Billings is an editor at Scientific American and the author of ''Five Billion Years of Solitude: The Search for Life Among the Stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Worlds may freeze and suns may perish, but there stirs something within us now that can never die again. .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. A day will come, one day in the unending succession of days, when beings, beings who are now latent in our thoughts and hidden in our loins, shall stand upon this earth as one stands upon a footstool, and shall laugh and reach out their hands amid the stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year was 1902, and the speaker was H.â€‰G. Wells, triumphantly concluding a presentation to the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Great Britain</span>. On the heels of his popular work of futurism, ''Anticipations,'' the institution's fellows had invited Wells to talk about what awaited the world in the new century. He chose to look much further, and prophesied that our descendants would someday abandon our planet for the depths of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to see why Wells was so optimistic, and why the fellows were so enthralled. Science and engineering were rapidly transforming the world before their eyes. It was being mechanized, electrified and globalized via automobiles, petroleum, power grids and transoceanic radio. J.â€‰P. Morgan had just created the first billion-dollar corporation, the Wright brothers would soon conduct their first powered flight, and Albert Einstein was on the threshold of unlocking the secrets of the atom. Amid all that progress, anything seemed possible -- even interplanetary and, someday, interstellar travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opening phase of Wells's grand vision came to fruition faster than even he had predicted, propelled by military competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in the aftermath of World War II. A half-century after his speech, the first humans would ride rockets into space, followed less than a decade later by journeys to the moon. As remarkable as this progression was, what's perhaps even more remarkable is how quickly space exploration subsequently lost momentum. We are now approaching a half-century since the last manned lunar voyage, and humans have yet to venture out again from low-Earth orbit. As a result, space travel -- one of the most futuristic things conceivable -- now seems rather retro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''Beyond,'' an expansive and enlightening overview of space travel's past, present and possible future, the distinguished astronomer Chris Impey says that despite the last few lackluster decades, the stars are still humanity's destination. Like Wells's before him, Impey's argument hinges on his encyclopedic scientific knowledge, his immense faith in technological innovation and on a restlessness he believes is fundamental to the human psyche. Any eventual migration off-world will require not only better rockets, robots and regulations, but also some spark from within. He highlights the example of DRD4 7R, a gene variant carried by one in five people that is associated with novelty-seeking, extroversion and hyperactivity. This variant seems to have emerged some 40,000 years ago, Impey notes, shortly after our ancestors' migrations out of sub-Saharan Africa, and is far more prevalent in the farthest-flung descendants of that ancient diaspora. The implication is clear, and resonates throughout the book: The urge to explore new physical frontiers is ''built into our DNA,'' and we can no more abandon it than we can our own humanity. The cosmos beckons, and we cannot resist its call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back down on Earth, however, Impey acknowledges that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is ''in the doldrums,'' burdened with an ever-growing list of responsibilities that persistently outstrip its year-to-year budget. However, that could soon change. As China rapidly builds a capability to send crews to the moon in the 2020s, Impey writes, robust funding for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> may once again become a matter of national security and pride. But even if no new space race emerges, that's O.K., because space travel is no longer the purview of lumbering governments. Impey's greatest optimism is for a new generation of deep-pocketed private-sector entrepreneurs poised to disrupt the business of rocketry, people like Elon Musk of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic, and Peter Diamandis of the <span class="companylink">XPrize Foundation</span>. The specifics are hazy, but Impey is confident some mix of suborbital tourism and innovation-stimulating technology prizes will soon lead to space travel's becoming ''massively commercialized,'' in a process he likens to the growth of the Internet in the 1990s. Once that's accomplished, spacefarers will be free to tackle the tasks of living and working beyond Earth, instead of simply getting there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Impey is not only a skilled scientist who studies active galactic nuclei, he's also an adept and prolific communicator, who packs his prose with wonderful anecdotes and weird factoids. In particular, Impey knows the value of strong characters in storytelling, and weaves much of his narrative around illuminating profiles of space pioneers old and new. He also clearly knows that sunny congeniality is a more appealing rhetorical device than sour skepticism. This leads to a minor trouble: his indulgence of questionable individuals and schemes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Dennis M. Hope, a 60-something ''overlord of the solar system'' who has sold more than a billion acres of interplanetary real estate to more than half a million customers. Impey uses Hope as a cute illustration of the vagaries of the nascent field of space law, but is Hope a charlatan? ''Not exactly,'' Impey writes, though he never really explains why not. More problematic is Impey's treatment of Bas Lansdorp, the Dutch entrepreneur and founder of Mars One, an organization with a less-than-half-baked plan to establish a colony on the Red Planet in the 2020s, in part through funding from a proposed reality television show. To date, much of Mars One's income seems to consist of fees and donations drawn from its starry-eyed applicants seeking a one-way ticket to Mars, something Impey doesn't mention. Impey does drop subtle hints that he knows that some of the people and projects he discusses are ridiculous and abusive of public good will, but readers might miss these delicate and indirect criticisms. One would hope for more forthright honesty from someone who clearly realizes space travel requires more than wishful thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Impey rises above the current woes of space agencies and the sometimes-Â­dubious plans of entrepreneurs, ''Beyond'' truly soars. Its concluding section presents a scattered but sweeping vision for our future in space, and offers more plausible ideas than can be found in whole shelves of futuristic science fiction. Want to construct a lunar base, or mine asteroids for precious resources? Are you looking for alien life in our solar system, or habitable planets around other stars? Impey covers all this and much, much more in a brilliantly brisk series of chapters intended to show how we might someday become not only an interplanetary species but also an interstellar one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a leap would be far more epochal than that of the Apollo moon landings, Impey notes. If Earth were the size of a Ping-Pong ball, the marble-size moon would be only a yard away -- and the nearest neighboring star system would be 30,000 miles distant. Though that distance may now seem insurmountable, Impey implores us to consider the possibility of crossing it, even if only to grasp how far we have come since our ancestors spread out of Africa, and how far we still must go in securing a legacy for our distant descendants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someday, the sun and Earth will perish, but humanity may have the choice to be ''more than a footnote in the history of the Milky Way.'' Contemplating this future ''and the possibility that we might not exist at all, is as haunting as deep space,'' Impey writes. ''Beyond'' is for everyone who longs to see the sun from across an interstellar gulf, ''like a buttercup set on velvet,'' a book for readers who wish to reach out their hands amid the stars.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR stargazers who want to peer deep into the universe, there's good news: Nowadays you don't need a telescope to do some amateur astronomy. With the right apps, your phone can be a powerful educational window into the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SkyView, for one, is a simple yet impressive stargazing app. You hold your phone up to the sky and the app's augmented reality display shows what stars, planets and constellations you're looking at.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SkyView makes use of the phone's camera and sensors and calculates where you are and which way your phone is pointing, then displays detailed maps and information like the names of comets or satellites on the screen, superimposed over the view of the actual sky. When you see something interesting, like a planet or a particular constellation, you tap the display for more information. Instead of cluelessly peering at the stars, you can know that the orangeish dot you see is called Betelgeuse, is part of the constellation of Orion and is the sky's ninth brightest star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app also lets you search for things you want to see. You might be interested to know the location of the International Space Station, for example. SkyView will show an arrow on the screen directing you where to point your phone in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SkyView is intuitive and suited to amateur astronomers and youngsters. It's free on iOS and Android (though on Android, different phones' sensors mean it may not be 100 percent reliable). The free version contains basic star information, but the $2 edition offers a more detailed star and satellite catalog. Most interestingly, the $2 SkyView on iOS now has an Apple Watch app that can alert you to coming events like meteor showers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other apps have similar features to SkyView. My personal favorite is Star Walk. While SkyView emphasizes simplicity of use, Star Walk has a slightly more serious feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Star Walk also works by displaying a dynamic map of the sky when you hold up your phone or tablet. It has an augmented-reality setting, so you can see what stars your phone is looking at through its camera. But by default this mode is switched off, and instead the app shows a detailed map of stars, galaxies and planets on the screen along with information about what you're seeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Star Walk's extras include beautiful animated graphics for the constellations (which you can turn off if they're too fussy) and 3-D animated graphics of objects like planets. You can also quickly dial time around to see what the sky will look like on a particular date, which may help you plan your future stargazing. Like SkyView, Star Walk also has a companion Apple Watch app to keep you alerted to phases of the moon, opportunities to spot the space station and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Star Walk's sophistication does mean it takes a while to learn all its menus and controls. It costs $3 for iOS and Android, and is $2.50 on Windows Phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Night Sky Lite is another similar app, available as a free download on iOS and Android. I like this app's extras, like the ''traveler mode'' that shows what the sky looks like from different cities. But its menus are sometimes tricky to navigate, and the free edition frequently nags users to upgrade to the $1 paid version that has more features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar Walk, meanwhile, acts as a detailed guide to the wonders of our solar system, jam-packed with detailed graphics, interesting text and eye-pleasing animations. If you're new to things astrophysical, this app can teach you all about Saturn's rings and a huge variety of moons, comets like the Hale-Bopp and even some space missions. The app is fabulous for explaining space matters to children. It's a $3 iOS and Android app, and there's a limited-feature free version.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wonders of the Universe, which costs $6, has detailed 2-D and 3-D graphics, animations and movies about subjects as diverse as the workings of a red dwarf star, the history of our moon and black holes. It's designed to be easy to understand, even if you have a limited science background. It's made in collaboration with the BBC, so it has high production values. While I wish this app came installed by default in new phones, it's for iOS devices only.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes our phone screens drag our attention away from the real world too much, so these apps may remind you to look up and be amazed by the night sky's beauty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick Call</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tumblr remains a hugely popular way to publish your own blog on traditional computers. Now the iOS Tumblr app has undergone an upgrade that includes the ability to start new blogs from your phone as well as other improvements. It's free on iOS.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- Russia's top space officials announced Wednesday that they would scuttle an unmanned cargo spacecraft that is orbiting the Earth after it malfunctioned on its way to resupply the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying to continue the mission of the Progress M27-M cargo ship, which malfunctioned Tuesday shortly after takeoff, could endanger those on board the space station, Igor Komarov, the head of the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span><span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span>, said in public remarks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a day of rumors about the scale of the damage to the cargo ship, which is carrying three tons of supplies, including fuel and food, Mr. Komarov said it was not possible for it to continue its flight and dock safely with the space station. ''We have discovered a lack of containment in the main engine block,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Russia's aerospace industry has had some embarrassments in recent years, in particular the failure of the Phobos-Grunt mission to one of Mars's moons in 2012, it has been known for reliable flights between the space station and Earth. The resupply mission was seen as routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Progress M27-M cargo freighter was launched into space on the back of a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The problems began almost immediately after it detached from the rocket. First, the cargo ship stopped sending telemetric data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later Tuesday, it was revealed that the ship was spinning uncontrollably, rotating at 90 degrees a second. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> released video from on board showing the Earth flying by as the ship gyrated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger's path will intersect with the surface of the planet. The impact of the 1,100-pound spacecraft at 8,750 miles per hour is expected to gouge a crater some 50 feet wide.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will bring to a close a mission that has painted an unexpected portrait of Mercury, once thought a boring round rock not much different from Earth's moon. Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, is only slightly larger than the moon, although it has more drastic temperature swings -- 800 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, minus 300 degrees at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really been exciting to see a planet unfold, a planet that is one is our neighbors,'' said Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator for the mission. ''Almost every aspect of Mercury has had its share of surprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger -- a shortening of Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geo-chemistry and Ranging -- discovered that Mercury shrank slightly as it cooled over billions of years; mapped ancient lava flows; found enigmatic shallow depressions that are some of the youngest and brightest features on the surface; and confirmed the presence of ice in perpetually dark craters near the poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water ice, perhaps a billion tons, was not a complete surprise. Radio telescope observations from Earth had hinted at something reflective, and the shadowed craters are extremely cold. Beyond confirming the suspected, Messenger also made a new discovery: The ice was covered by an unexplained dark layer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a reasoned hypothesis,'' Dr. Solomon said. The material could be carbon-rich compounds, similar to substances found in certain meteorites and in comets. ''It's tarlike in its consistency,'' he said. ''It's as dark as tar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest scientific finding of the mission, Dr. Solomon said, was that Mercury was rich in ''volatiles,'' elements like chlorine, sulfur, potassium and sodium that easily evaporate at moderate temperatures. Mercury is small and dense, full of iron, and the thinking about how it formed was that it must have been heated to temperatures that should have boiled off the volatiles. Yet the volatiles are still there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists now have to come up with new ideas to explain how Mercury formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">NASA</span> launched Messenger in 2004, knowledge of Mercury was sparse. The only close-ups had come in three flybys by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mariner 10 in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than six years, Messenger took a circuitous route through the inner solar system, making flybys of Earth, Venus and Mercury, to slow itself down enough to enter orbit around Mercury. On March 18, 2011, it finally arrived. The orbital portion of the mission was originally planned for one year, then was extended twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, the spacecraft has run out of fuel for the thrusters. Engineers came up with a clever trick to use pressurized helium, which pushes fuel to the thrusters, to provide three additional boosts that kept it in orbit a while longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A push on Friday lifted the minimum altitude to 11.3 miles from 5.1 miles, a bit less than engineers had hoped. One more maneuver is planned for Tuesday. But the helium is almost exhausted, and the low point of the orbit will decrease again. Messenger, still gathering data, is expected to hit at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Solomon will be at the missions operations center, at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. ''Unfortunately, it's going to be a little anticlimactic,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it crashes, Messenger will be behind Mercury, out of view from Earth. Dr. Solomon and the rest of the team will not be certain of Messenger's demise until hours later, when the craft does not emerge from behind Mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be a somber moment,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even its destruction could provide insights by digging up what lies beneath the surface -- but it will be some time before anyone will see what that is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> does not have any follow-up Mercury missions set, but an ambitious European and Japanese collaboration called BepiColombo is scheduled to launch in 2017. It is to arrive at Mercury in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mission consists of two orbiters, one focusing on the planet, the other on the surrounding space environment, in greater and finer detail than Messenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johannes Benkhoff, the project scientist for BepiColombo at the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, described Messenger as a ''really a fantastic mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's perfect that we have BepiColombo to follow on'' Messenger's findings, Dr. Benkhoff said. ''They have provided a lot of new results, unexpected results.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BepiColombo is named after Giuseppe Colombo, an Italian scientist nicknamed Bepi who came up with the orbital trajectories that enabled <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mariner 10 flybys.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, a theoretical physicist in Stockholm, made the jarring suggestion that dark matter might cause cancer. She was not talking about the ''dark matter'' of the genome (another term for junk DNA) but about the hypothetical, lightless particles that cosmologists believe pervade the universe and hold the galaxies together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it has yet to be directly detected, dark matter is presumed to exist because we can see the effects of its gravity. As its invisible particles pass through our bodies, they could be mutating DNA, the theory goes, adding at an extremely low level to the overall rate of cancer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unsettling to see two such seemingly different realms, cosmology and oncology, suddenly juxtaposed. But that was just the beginning. Shortly after Dr. Hossenfelder broached her idea in an online essay, Michael Rampino, a professor at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, added geology and paleontology to the picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter, he proposed in an article for the <span class="companylink">Royal Astronomical Society</span>, is responsible for the mass extinctions that have periodically swept Earth, including the one that killed the dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His idea is based on speculations by other scientists that the Milky Way is sliced horizontally through its center by a thin disk of dark matter. As the sun, traveling around the galaxy, bobs up and down through this darkling plane, it generates gravitational ripples strong enough to dislodge distant comets from their orbits, sending them hurtling toward Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier version of this hypothesis was put forth last year by the Harvard physicists Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece. But Dr. Rampino has added another twist: During Earth's galactic voyage, dark matter accumulates in its core. There the particles self-destruct, generating enough heat to cause deadly volcanic eruptions. Struck from above and below, the dinosaurs succumbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Itis surprising to see something as abstract as dark matter take on so much solidity, at least in the human mind. The idea was invented in the early 1930s as a theoretical contrivance -- a means of explaining observations that otherwise didn't make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galaxies appear to be rotating so fast that they should have spun apart long ago, throwing off stars like sparks from a Fourth of July pinwheel. There just isn't enough gravity to hold a galaxy together, unless you assume that it hides a huge amount of unseen matter -- particles that neither emit or absorb light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some mavericks propose alternatives, attempting to tweak the equations of gravity to account for what seems like missing mass. But for most cosmologists, the idea of unseeable matter has become so deeply ingrained that it has become almost impossible to do without it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Said to be five times more abundant than the stuff we can see, dark matter is a crucial component of the theory behind gravitational lensing, in which large masses like galaxies can bend light beams and cause stars to appear in unexpected parts of the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the explanation for the spectacular observation of an ''Einstein Cross'' reported last month. Acting like an enormous lens, a cluster of galaxies deflected the light of a supernova into four images -- a cosmological mirage. The light for each reflection followed a different path, providing glimpses of four different moments of the explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not even a galactic cluster exerts enough gravity to bend light so severely unless you postulate that most of its mass consists of hypothetical dark matter. In fact, astronomers are so sure that dark matter exists that they have embraced gravitational lensing as a tool to map its extent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter, in other words, is used to explain gravitational lensing, and gravitational lensing is taken as more evidence for dark matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some skeptics have wondered if this is a modern-day version of what ancient astronomers called ''saving the phenomena.'' With enough elaborations, a theory can account for what we see without necessarily describing reality. The classic example is the geocentric model of the heavens that Ptolemy laid out in the Almagest, with the planets orbiting Earth along paths of complex curlicues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ptolemy apparently didn't care whether his filigrees were real. What was important to him was that his model worked, predicting planetary movements with great precision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern scientists are not ready to settle for such subterfuge. To show that dark matter resides in the world and not just in their equations, they are trying to detect it directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though its identity remains unknown, most theorists are betting that dark matter consists of WIMPs -- weakly interacting massive particles. If they really exist, it might be possible to glimpse them when they interact with ordinary matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on that hope, scientists have constructed underground detectors attempting to measure the impact of the particles as they fly through Earth and occasionally collide with atoms of xenon, argon or some other substance. But so far, there have been no hits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere from 10 to a few thousand times a year, Dr. Hossenfelder estimated, a WIMP may happen to strike one of our own atoms, including some that make up DNA. The energy would be strong enough to break molecular bonds and cause mutations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to cancer, that is a negligible threat. Two of Dr. Hossenfelder's colleagues, Katherine Freese and Christopher Savage, estimate that cosmic rays zipping through a human body cause more damage in a second than dark matter would in a lifetime. But the effect of dark matter is still strong enough that scientists are considering using DNA or RNA molecules as WIMP detectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If WIMPs turn out to be a fiction, something else will have to be found to explain all of the missing mass. Something is screwy about the universe, and astronomers are determined to find out why.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booster, or first stage, has nine engines and lifted the rocket from the launching pad through the first 2 minutes and 40 seconds of flight. Riding on top of the Falcon 9 was a capsule carrying about two tons of cargo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its fuel mostly expended, the first-stage then detached and fell away. The single engine on the second stage of the Falcon 9 ignited, and the cargo capsule continued its upward arc to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stage then performed a series of acrobatic maneuvers: flipping 180 degrees and reigniting its engines for half a minute as the onboard computer aimed it toward the 300-foot-by-170-foot platform, which <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has playfully named ''Just Read the Instructions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two earlier landing attempts this year were encouraging failures. In January, the stage made it to the platform, but ran out of hydraulic fluid to move the grid fins, and came down at a 45-degree angle and exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next Falcon 9 flight, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> added hydraulic fluid to the rocket, but could not deploy the landing platform known as the ''drone ship'' because of 25-foot-high waves. The rocket stage still went through the motions of landing, but without the platform, it toppled over into the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Mr. Musk did not provide details of why the landing was ''too hard for survival'' as he posted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists think that most of the moons in the solar system were probably formed by the consolidation of disks of dust and gas that circulated around them early in the history of the system.

It's full of filmmakers and TV creators, who have been joking about space travel gone awry at least since ''A Trip to the Moon'' in 1902. So anyone trying to boldly go there these days has to put more effort into the venture than went into ''Other Space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series, whose eight-episode first season becomes available in its entirety Tuesday on <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> Screen, gives us a group of young (too young, really) astronauts who are on a space-mapping mission when they collide with an alternate universe-ish thing and are sucked into it. The crew exhibits the usual mixture of incompetence and tension, and the central dynamic is between the captain, Stewart (Karan Soni), and Karen (Bess Rous), his older sister, who had also aspired to command the ship.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series was created by Paul Feig, whose résumé includes the TV cult hit ''Freaks and Geeks'' and the box-office smash ''Bridesmaids,'' so it seems as if it ought to be sharper. But too many other shows and movies have worked this territory better, most recently the Cracked.com series ''Starship Icarus,'' introduced last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plotlines are moderately intriguing, especially in the second episode, when evidence mounts that an outside entity has taken over the personality of one crew member, leading to a group interrogation that has everyone under suspicion. But the cast, a mixture of actors, comics and writers, isn't really up to the challenge of getting the best out of this material. The whole thing is delivered sketch-comedy style, which is fine at a five-minute length but a bit wearying as a series.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humans have not exactly left Earth. It has been 40 years or so, in fact, since representatives of this erstwhile spacefaring species have been more than a few hundred miles from our planet's surface.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, human spaceflight, such as it is, is centered on the International Space Station. It lumbers around Earth about 250 miles out, going in and out of darkness every 90 minutes on average. It is staffed by six astronauts who spend their time -- when they are not singing David Bowie songs -- doing maintenance and conducting scientific and medical experiments. A new set of investigations will examine the cosmic Kelly twins, Scott and Mark, as a pair of genetically synchronized watches -- one on the station, one on Earth -- for a year to see what happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station has cost roughly $100 billion. Ever since this giant Tinkertoy began to come together, pundits, scientists, politicians and fans of space exploration have argued over what it is for, whether it is worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the little-known benefits of the space station is that it is at just the right altitude to photograph things on Earth. Every week, the astronauts aboard the space station record images of things that would spew headlines if we saw them on any one of the thousands of planets that we now know circle other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth Day is coming up, and so it's worth taking a look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From above, we can see how geology has become destiny. This is the one place we know in the universe where primordial forces -- the ones that gave rise to our wrinkled mountain ranges, gouges of canyons, winding ribbons of water and mud, circus spirals of clouds, volcanos, continents slipping under one another, a crust that splits and belches fire -- have conspired to bring about life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth has been habitable -- that is, temperate enough for liquid water on the surface -- for four billion years, geologists say, regulated by the ebb and flow of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the crust. Washed out of the atmosphere by rain, that greenhouse gas weathers rocks, carrying silica, calcium and carbon compounds into the ocean and eventually under the ocean floor. Millions of years later, carbon dioxide is disgorged in volcanos, replenishing the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thermostat is self-regulating. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more violent the weather, and the faster the gas is rained out. When it cools off, there is less rain and carbon dioxide builds back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given a chance in the form of a stable environment, life thrives in unexpected ways. From above, the entire world seems like one organism, one market exchange for genes -- and, as demonstrated by lights seen from above, an increasingly complicated and gaudy nervous system more and more apparent to the rest of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glory of the Earth is its blue oceans, the cradle of life as we know it. Someday, we might find another one Out There -- Earth 2.0, it is sometimes called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our planet's marine blue is so striking that it showed up in Voyager 1's camera from four billion miles away on Feb. 14, 1990, and again posing in the far distance beyond Saturn's rings for the Cassini spacecraft's camera on July 19, 2013.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JONI MITCHELL beat Carl Sagan to the punch. She sang ''we are stardust, billion-year-old carbon'' in her 1970 song ''Woodstock.'' That was three years before Mr. Sagan wrote about humans' being made of ''star-stuff'' in his book ''The Cosmic Connection'' -- a point he would later convey to a far larger audience in his 1980 television series, ''Cosmos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, ''stardust'' and ''star-stuff'' have nearly turned cliché. But that does not make the reality behind those words any less profound or magical: The iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones and the oxygen we breathe are the physical remains -- ashes, if you will -- of stars that lived and died long ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That discovery is relatively recent. Four astrophysicists developed the idea in a landmark paper published in 1957. They argued that almost all the elements in the periodic table were cooked up over time through nuclear reactions inside stars -- rather than in the first instants of the Big Bang, as previously thought. The stuff of life, in other words, arose in places and times somewhat more accessible to our telescopic investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since most of us spend our lives confined to a narrow strip near Earth's surface, we tend to think of the cosmos as a lofty, empyrean realm far beyond our reach and relevance. We forget that only a thin sliver of atmosphere separates us from the rest of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But science continues to show just how intimately connected life on Earth is to extraterrestrial processes. In particular, several recent findings have further illuminated the cosmic origins of life's key ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the element phosphorus, for example. It is a critical constituent of DNA, as well as of our cells, teeth and bones. Astronomers have long struggled to trace its buildup through cosmic history, because the imprint of phosphorus is difficult to discern in old, cool stars in the outskirts of our galaxy. (Some of these stellar ''time capsules'' contain the ashes of their forebears, the very first generation of stars that formed near the dawn of time.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a paper published in December in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, a research team reported that it had measured the abundance of phosphorus in 13 such stars, using data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. Their findings highlight the dominant role of so-called hypernovae, explosions even more energetic than supernovae that spell the demise of massive stars, in making the elements essential for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than just atoms were produced in the celestial realm. Growing evidence suggests that interstellar space was also where atoms united to make some molecules pertinent for life. A study published last fall in Science, for example, used computer simulations to establish the provenance of Earth's water. Its surprising verdict: Up to half the water on our planet is older than the solar system itself. Ancient water molecules assembled in the chilly confines of a gigantic gas cloud. That cloud spawned our sun and the planets that orbit it -- and somehow those ancient water molecules survived the perils of the planetary birth process to end up in our oceans and, presumably, our bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such interstellar clouds may have been well suited for brewing a multitude of molecules. Last fall, in another study published in Science, a research team reported the first discovery in a stellar nursery of a carbon-bearing molecule with a ''branched'' structure. The detection of this molecule, the researchers wrote, ''bodes well'' for the presence in interstellar space of amino acids, for which a branched structure is a defining feature. (The researchers made use of a vast, partially operational network of radio dishes being erected on a high-altitude plateau in northern Chile, whose location makes it easier for radio emissions to reach us from the coldest bits of the galaxy, where the alchemy of life is presumed to have begun.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astrochemists are excited by this discovery because amino acids, which have been found already in some meteorites, form the basis of proteins. Meanwhile, last month, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists reported the creation of key DNA components in a laboratory experiment that simulated the space environment. Together, these findings raise the odds that life's building blocks were concocted in space and blended into the material that formed Earth and its planetary siblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the material comforts and the relentless distractions of modern life, the universe at large may appear remote, intangible and irrelevant, especially to those of us who are city dwellers. But the next time you catch a glimpse of the Milky Way in its true glory, from a dark outpost far from city lights, think of those countless stars as nuclear factories and the starless hazy patches as molecular breweries. It is not much of a stretch to imagine the inchoate seeds of life emerging in the distance.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being black in America is a science-fiction experience,'' the culture critic and musician Greg Tate once asserted in an interview, articulating the premise for what has come to be called Afrofuturism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An irresistibly catchy label that has been attached to museum shows and parsed in scholarly journals, Afrofuturism now provides the organizing principle for a mosaic of narrative features, documentaries, animations and television shows screening at the <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Academy of Music</span> through April 15 under the rubric ''Space Is the Place.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term doesn't characterize a genre or a movement so much as an aesthetic, said Naima J. Keith, who was a curator for the exhibition ''The Shadows Took Shape'' last year at the Studio Museum in Harlem. A strategy found in literature, music, art and film, Afrofuturism is an imaginative reworking of African-American history, developing allegories of abduction and enslavement, and employing sci-fi concepts such as genetic transformation, alternate realities and, in some cases, repatriation to a home planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New genealogies and origin myths proliferate in the series, programmed by the British film journalist Ashley Clark. Afrofuturist protagonists are typically aliens and sometimes cyborgs, as in Kibwe Tavares's computer-animated ''Robots of Brixton'' (2011). Not just space travel but also time travel is possible, figuring in both Haile Gerima's ''Sankofa'' (1993) and Ngozi Onwurah's ''Welcome II the Terrordome'' (1995), where, as in several films, radio functions as the modern equivalent of a tribal drum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an idiom and an approach, Afrofuturism is restricted neither to Africans, Americans nor African-Americans. Lizzie Borden's ''Born in Flames'' (1983) and John Sayles's ''The Brother From Another Planet'' (1984), two independent movies made a decade before the term was coined, have entered the Afrofuturist canon and are both by white American filmmakers. Other artists represented in the series were born in Britain or are based there. Wanuri Kahiu's ''Pumzi'' (2009) is set in a postapocalyptic Kenya; Frances Bodomo's more optimistic and ironic ''Afronauts'' (2014) posits a space race between the United States and Zambia. An ancient Egyptian past melds with an extraterrestrial future -- or vice versa -- in both John Coney's ''Space Is the Place'' (1974), an underground counter-Blaxploitation fantasy, and ''The Last Angel of History'' (1997), a film essay by John Akomfrah whose interviewees include Mr. Tate; the novelist Ishmael Reed; and the multimedia artist Paul D. Miller, a.k.a. DJ Spooky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afrofuturism existed before it was named. In ''Black to the Future,'' the 1994 interview-essay by Mark Dery that popularized the term, Mr. Tate cited Ralph Ellison's ''The Invisible Man'' as a precursor, along with science-fiction novels by Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler, Jean-Michel Basquiat's artwork and Public Enemy's album ''Fear of a Black Planet,'' remarking, ''I don't know if it gets any more sci-fi than that!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Musicians are key, notably the avant-garde jazz composer and bandleader Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount in Birmingham, Ala.), who recast himself as an extraterrestrial and performed in appropriately fanciful costumes, and the similarly flamboyant self-invented funk maestro George Clinton, the leader of the band Parliament, whose 1975 album, ''Mothership Connection'' (on which he speaks as the Star Child addressing the ''citizens of the universe''), is a crucial text.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Academy</span> series is titled after a Sun Ra production -- in ''Space Is the Place,'' he stars as himself, beamed to Earth from Saturn to wage a war of mind control against the satanic supernatural pimp known as the Overseer. Delivering a message to black America, Sun Ra declares, ''Time has officially ended,'' and later announces, ''Everything you have desired on this planet and never received will be yours in outer space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun Ra is the subject of a more straightforward documentary portrait, Robert Mugge's ''A Joyful Noise'' (1980), while Mr. Clinton is a presence, as host of a three-part TV movie, ''Cosmic Slop'' (1994), a ''Twilight Zone''-inflected anthology directed by Reginald Hudlin; his older brother, Warrington Hudlin; and Kevin Rodney Sullivan. Mr. Clark has further expanded the parameters of Afrofuturism by including Shirley Clarke's portrait of the jazz musician and composer Ornette Coleman, ''Ornette: Made in America'' (1985), an appropriately nonlinear immersion in Mr. Coleman's cosmology and music -- some of which, according to the documentary, was requested by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> for use in its space shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest thing to an Afrofuturist manifesto is ''The Last Angel of History.'' Its director, Mr. Akomfrah, a founder of the Black Audio Film Collective and former governor of the British Film Institute, uses the framing device of a 22nd-century equivalent to the blues singer Robert Johnson to sample and explicate Afrofuturist music. In addition to Sun Ra and Mr. Clinton, the movie advances the Jamaican music producer Lee (Scratch) Perry as one of the mode's forefathers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Gil Scott-Heron's caustic ''Whitey on the Moon,'' a poem that invoked ghetto misery to bring <span class="companylink">NASA</span> triumphalism crashing to earth, might be considered a critique of Afrofuturism, the features included in ''Space Is the Place'' are largely representations of oppression and resistance. ''Born in Flames'' concerns a gender war, refracted through the news media, that involves a largely black and lesbian army. ''Welcome II the Terrordome,'' which acknowledges a Public Enemy opus in its title, is a ferocious rap opera set in a dystopian Bantustan and using a call for revolution delivered by Malcolm X.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clark is particularly pleased to be showing a 35-millimeter print, because ''Terrordome'' has barely surfaced here. ''It will blow people's minds,'' he told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sankofa'' is a graphic account of American slavery, while, more benign but no less angry, ''The Brother From Another Planet'' stars Joe Morton as an expressively mute, enslaved extraterrestrial who is chased by a pair of robotic white slave hunters (David Strathairn and Mr. Sayles) and finds refuge in Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As elastic as it is, the Afrofuturist vision contains multitudes. Terence Nance's playful and obsessively self-reflexive love story ''An Oversimplification of Her Beauty'' (2013) is Afrofuturist largely in its sense of self-invention and intermittently cosmic animation. The series has room for Hollywood as well, in the form of ''Blade,'' the 1998 superhero horror film that casts Wesley Snipes as a half-vampire vampire slayer. No satisfactory print was available for ''The Spook Who Sat by the Door'' -- a 1973 film by Ivan Dixon in which the C.I.A.'s token African-American operative puts his training at the service of a black revolution -- which Mr. Clark sees as a complement to ''Welcome II the Terrordome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an essay for the Sight and Sound website, Mr. Clark argued that Steve McQueen's recent ''12 Years a Slave'' was akin to Afrofuturism. Anticipated in some ways by the more overtly sci-fi ''Sankofa,'' the movie takes its audience ''to another planet: our own, where the truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.'' The Afrofuturist mission is to make that truth evident.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- For more than a half-century, a small group of astronomers has sought intelligent company among the stars. They've done so by turning large radio antennas skyward, hoping to eavesdrop on signals from an advanced society. It's a program known as SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now some researchers propose that we should do more than simply don headphones and await E.T.'s call: We should make serious efforts to encourage a response from putative aliens by deliberately transmitting our own messages. It's a simple idea, akin to tossing a bottle into the cosmic ocean. But recent arguments for what's termed active SETI have loosed a storm of controversy, one that has even washed into the halls of academe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this? Why has the sending of dispatches to worlds many trillions of miles distant suddenly become a hot-button issue? The simple answer is that there's now a perception that advertising our existence could be a mortal threat to the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasoning is this: While no one has yet offered decisive proof for life beyond Earth, in the past two years astronomers have learned that tens of billions of habitable planets suffuse our galaxy. Consequently, to believe that only Earth has spawned intelligence is to insist that our world is the site of a miracle. That point of view rarely appeals to scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aliens could very well be out there. And that realization has spurred a call by some for broadcasts intended to elicit a communication from at least the nearest other star systems. But we know nothing of the aliens' possible motives or behavior. Therefore, it's conceivable that betraying our existence might prompt aggressive action from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadcasting is likened to ''shouting in the jungle'' -- not a good idea when you don't know what's out there. The British physicist Stephen Hawking alluded to this danger by noting that on Earth, when less advanced societies drew the attention of those more advanced, the consequences for the former were seldom agreeable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a worry we never used to have. Victorian-era scientists toyed with plans to use lanterns and burning pools of oil to contact postulated Martians. In the 1970s, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> bolted greeting cards onto spacecraft that will leave our solar system and wander the vast reaches between the stars. The Pioneer and Voyager probes carry plaques and records with information about what humans look like and where Earth is, as well as a small sampling of our culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those messages move at the speed of rockets. But in 1974, a three-minute encoded pictogram was transmitted using the large radio antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. It moves at the speed of light, 20,000 times faster. More recent radio transmissions include a Beatles song beamed by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to the North Star, a Doritos advertisement launched to a planetary system in the Big Dipper, and a series of broadcasts sent to nearby stars using an antenna in Crimea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When most people believed that aliens were no more than easy black hats for Hollywood, the idiosyncratic nature of these messages could be easily dismissed. But if cosmic company is a legitimate possibility, shouldn't we offer up something more edifying than pop music and snack food? A deliberate transmission should represent all of humanity -- not short-circuit the important question of who will speak for Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, recent conferences on the merits of active SETI have sought the advice of social scientists. Among their worries is whether to be up front about humanity's seamy side: Should we tell the extraterrestrials about war and injustice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I think this concern is overwrought. Any society that can pick up our radio messages will be at a level of development at least centuries beyond our own. They would be no more incensed by our bad behavior than historians who learned that Babylonians attacked one another with spears. It seems naïve to imagine that, by shielding aliens from the less flattering aspects of humanity, we would somehow lessen any incentive to do us harm. If there's a danger, mincing words is unlikely to eliminate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better approach is to note that the nearest intelligent extraterrestrials are likely to be at least dozens of light-years away. Even assuming that active SETI provokes a reply, it won't be breezy conversation. Simple back-and-forth exchanges would take decades. This suggests that we should abandon the ''greeting card'' format of previous signaling schemes, and offer the aliens Big Data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, we could transmit the contents of the Internet. Such a large corpus -- with its text, pictures, videos and sounds -- would allow clever extraterrestrials to decipher much about our society, and even formulate questions that could be answered with the material in hand. Sending the web on its way would take months if a radio transmitter were used. A powerful laser, conveying bits much like an optical fiber, could launch these data in a few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sending messages -- even big ones -- is technically feasible. However, there's still the highly controversial matter of whether to broadcast at all. Who decides? One could simply let the public weigh in, but doing so wouldn't address the security issue. Even if a majority is comfortable with a transmission, how does that mitigate the possible danger?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inability to gauge this peril prompts some critics to argue that, given the possibly existential threat posed by active SETI, we should choose the side of caution. We should simply forbid powerful transmissions to the skies. Indeed, a small consortium of academics in California has drafted a petition urging this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a wary approach. It's also poor insurance. Any extraterrestrials with technology advanced enough to threaten us will surely have antennas larger than our own, instruments that can pick up the television and radio signals broadcast willy-nilly since World War II. We are already shouting into the jungle, albeit with less volume than a deliberate signal. But the dangerous creatures may have good hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, if we forbid high-powered transmitters aimed at the sky, we shut out such obvious future technologies as better radars for aviation and tracking dangerous asteroids. Do we really want to hamstring our descendants this way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decision to engage in active SETI has not been made. The benefit -- learning our place in the cosmos -- is only hypothetical, and so is the danger. But I, for one, would hesitate to let a paranoia based on nothing more than conjecture shackle the activities of our children and our children's children. The universe beckons, and we can do better than to declare that future generations should endlessly tremble at the sight of the stars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That year is to be the longest space mission a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronaut has ever undertaken. This trip -- Mr. Kelly's fourth to space -- will also push him to the top in cumulative time in space among <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s astronauts. When he lands in March 2016, he will have spent more than 500 days of his life floating in orbit, including a 159-day trip to the space station that ended in 2011.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his trip this time twice as long, ''my expectation is that it'll be more challenging and, as a result, more rewarding,'' Mr. Kelly, 51, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all travelers to the space station since the retirement of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s space shuttles in 2011, Mr. Kelly and the two Russians, Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, will be launching on a Russian Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Liftoff is scheduled for 3:42 p.m. Friday Eastern time, which is 1:42 a.m. Saturday in Baikonur. The Soyuz capsule will dock at the space station about six hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, stays at the International Space Station have lasted about six months. In the 1980s and 1990s, Russian astronauts made longer trips to the Mir space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists hope to learn more about the physical and psychological toll of long space missions, including the effects of factors like weightlessness and radiation on bones, the circulatory system and muscles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of those things really affect the bodies of astronauts,'' Julie A. Robinson, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s chief scientist for the space station, said during a news conference in January. ''They push them to something not at all unlike aging on Earth, where their balance is disrupted, their hearts are weaker, their immune system isn't functioning as well, their muscles are weaker and their bones are being lost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is part of the groundwork <span class="companylink">NASA</span> wants to complete before it would be ready, in a couple of decades, to send astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're doing this so that we can mitigate those effects, so we can eventually go beyond low-Earth orbit one day and explore further than we've gone before,'' Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists will see whether Mr. Kelly's experience differs from his earlier trip, especially during the second six months. They will also conduct experiments comparing his health to that of his twin brother, Mark Kelly, a retired <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronaut, on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark will participate as a sort of a ground control to really help us understand this nature-versus-nurture question,'' Dr. Robinson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kornienko will also remain in the space station for a year, but he will not set any Russian space records by doing so. In 1995, Valery Polyakov set the world's record for longest single stay in space at nearly 438 days when he returned from Mir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Padalka, who will be spending the typical six months at the space station, will set a record, for the most total time by any astronaut in space, about 878 days. A retired Russian astronaut, Sergei Krikalev, is the current record-holder, with 803 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly said that during his year off the planet he thought he would miss the same things he missed last time. ''The human connection with your friends and family,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Getting away from work. Going outside.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the space station as a ''magical place,'' but added, ''You never get to leave.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in a paper published Thursday in The Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, another team reported signs of another under-ice ocean, on Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter's moons. Scientists are already convinced that there is a large ocean, also covered by ice, on another Jovian moon, Europa. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Galileo spacecraft had also found hints of hidden water on Ganymede and on another of Jupiter's moons, Callisto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new research, using the Hubble Space Telescope, fits with the earlier hints. ''This is now stronger evidence for an ocean,'' said Joachim Saur, a professor of geophysics at the University of Cologne in Germany and the lead author of the Ganymede paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Surprising is the understatement,'' Christopher P. McKay, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., said of the multitude of watery moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After spending so many years going after Mars, which is so dry and so bereft of organics and so just plain dead, it's wonderful to go to the outer solar system and find water, water everywhere,'' said Dr. McKay, who studies the possibility of life on alien worlds. He was not involved in either of the papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Enceladus findings, Dr. Hsu and his colleagues based their conclusions on minuscule dust particles that <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Cassini spacecraft encountered as it approached Saturn and after it entered orbit. Instruments on Cassini determined that the particles, less than a millionth of an inch in diameter, were high in silicon but had little or no metals like sodium or magnesium. Dr. Hsu said the dust was probably silica, a molecule of one silicon and two oxygen atoms, the building block of the mineral quartz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers were also able to trace the dust to Saturn's E Ring, and the material in the E Ring originates from Enceladus, from plumes that emanate near the moon's south pole. ''That's the circumstantial part of the work,'' Dr. Hsu acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They performed laboratory experiments to see which conditions could produce the silica particles. The result was alkaline water, with a pH of 8.5 to 10.5, heated to at least 194 degrees. The results fit in with findings last year by other scientists who suggested that Enceladus concealed not just pockets of water but a sea at least as large as Lake Superior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mystery is how the interior of Enceladus, just 313 miles wide, grows that hot. A moon that small probably does not have enough radioactive elements at its core to provide continued warmth. A chemical reaction between water and rock called serpentinization could also provide some heat, but the primary mechanism is probably the tidal forces that Saturn exerts on Enceladus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The amount of energy being dissipated currently, as well as the location of heating, is not well understood,'' said Terry A. Hurford, a scientist at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. ''So it is possible that heating can bring water to those temperatures locally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earlier evidence for an ocean on Ganymede came from magnetic measurements during flybys by the Galileo probe, which suggested a conductive layer below the surface. Ice is not a good conductor. Saltwater is. But the readings could also be explained by oddities in Ganymede's magnetic field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new research, the Hubble telescope scrutinized Ganymede for seven hours. It could not see below the surface, but it observed the shimmering lights of Ganymede's auroras. As Jupiter rotates, once every 10 hours, its changing magnetic field causes the auroras to sway. If Ganymede were frozen, computer simulations showed, its aurora would sway by 6 degrees. But the salts of an under-ice ocean would generate a counteracting magnetic field, and the auroras would sway by only 2 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auroras swayed 2 degrees. ''It was exactly like all our computer modeling and all our theory predicted,'' Dr. Saur said. ''It was right on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists are now applying the approach to Io, a fiery world that certainly does not have an ocean of water. But it might have an underground ocean of magma that would similarly dampen the swaying of auroras. The technique could one day be used to explore planets around distant stars and see if they, too, might have oceans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a place for life, Ganymede is less promising, because the ocean looks to be sandwiched between layers of ice and not in contact with rock. By contrast, Enceladus appears to possess all of the necessary ingredients -- heat, liquid water and organic molecules -- and a future probe could analyze the water by simply flying through the plumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My mantra now is follow the plume,'' Dr. McKay said.</p>

The magnetic collisions, which can potentially disrupt satellites and power grids, are not well understood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first step is to figure out what the heck is going on,'' John Dorelli, a space scientist at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in an interview.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The protective bubble of the Earth's magnetic field typically deflects high-speed particles from the sun. But an onslaught of particles from a solar explosion can pop the outer layers of the bubble. ''Right where the solar wind meets the magnetosphere, that boundary, you have a weak point in the magnetic field,'' Dr. Dorelli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of the popping, known as magnetic reconnection, remain mysterious. (The same process, on a much larger scale, generates the solar explosions known as coronal mass ejections.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charged particles in the solar wind, mostly electrons and protons traveling at about a million miles per hour, generate a magnetic field as they move. If the direction of the field is opposite to that of Earth's field, the magnetic fields realign and partly merge as they near one another. That is similar to what happens when two bar magnets attract each other -- the north pole of one is pulled toward the south pole of the other. In space, the realignment releases energy that accelerates and heats the cloud of charged particles, which scientists call plasma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's sort of like pounding down on a tube of toothpaste,'' Dr. Dorelli said. ''That thing just collapses very rapidly, and it squeezes the plasma out very rapidly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a giant solar explosion arrives at Earth, the squeezed particles race around the planet to the tail of the magnetic bubble over the night side. That sets off more magnetic reconnections, shooting particles back at Earth that induce electrical currents in the ground. The currents can flow into electrical transmission lines, potentially overloading transformers and causing continentwide blackouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equations describing magnetic reconnection can be written simply but not solved. Even the biggest, fastest computers cannot establish what is going on. Thus, scientists are looking to the $1.1 billion <span class="companylink">NASA</span> mission to provide measurements to guide them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying the find those hot spots out in space,'' Roy B. Torbert, deputy principal investigator for the mission, said at a news conference Wednesday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. ''We do not understand at all what causes the dissipation in plasmas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the two-year mission, four identical octagonal spacecraft, each weighing as much as a compact car, are to fly in a pyramid formation that will let them obtain three-dimensional pictures of the magnetic fields and plasma. The deluge of data could help scientists better predict the timing and effects of solar storms.</p>

The finding may be the latest in a long string of cosmic false alarms, they said, or it might be that the mysterious dark matter that permeates the universe is finally showing its face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed, the results could mean that most of the matter of the universe is in the form of as-yet-unidentified elementary particles, 20 to 100 times as heavy as a proton, that have been drifting and clumping like fog in space ever since the Big Bang.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the gamma-ray signal is ''tantalizing,'' in the words of Alex Geringer-Sameth of <span class="companylink">Carnegie Mellon University</span> and colleagues from Brown and Cambridge Universities, ''it would be premature to conclude it has a dark matter origin.'' Their analysis appears in a paper submitted to the journal Physical Review Letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group used data from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Fermi Large Area Telescope, which orbits the Earth, to search for gamma rays from a loose-looking accumulation of stars known as Reticulum-2, in the southern constellation of the same name. It is one of a rare breed known as dwarf galaxies, which can have fewer than a hundred stars and are only a billionth as luminous and a millionth as massive as the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because dwarf galaxies have so little atomic matter, astronomers see them as happy hunting grounds for dark matter. That mysterious stuff has led scientists on a merry chase ever since Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s and Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the 1970s discerned that galaxies move under the gravitational influence of massive clouds of invisible matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmologists now agree that dark matter is 80 percent of the matter in the universe and that it is not the ordinary atomic matter that planets and people are made of, nor anything else predicted by the Standard Model that rules particle physics today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately physicists have speculated that it consists of exotic particles left over from the Big Bang known colloquially as Wimps -- for weakly interacting massive particles. So far particle accelerators like CERN's Large Hadron Collider have been unable to make them, although looking for them will be a major priority when that machine starts running again this spring. Meanwhile, there is the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the centers of galaxies, where dark matter is densest, the Wimp particles would collide and annihilate one another in a telltale flash of gamma rays, the thinking goes. Some support for this notion has come from the Fermi telescope's observations of excess gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, coming from the center of the Milky Way. But astronomers cannot rule out the possibility that pulsars, black holes and other astrophysical phenomena are creating the gamma rays in our own galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, dwarf galaxies typically appear to have nothing going on in them at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are very quiet systems, just containing some old stars and a lot of dark matter,'' Dr. Geringer-Sameth said in an email. ''If you see any excess gamma rays coming from them, something intriguing is going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neal Weiner, a dark matter theorist at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, agreed, saying, ''If you see gamma rays in a dwarf galaxy, it would be a good way to make a case that you are seeing dark matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately astronomers have been discovering these dwarfs in droves, thanks to new tools like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Reticulum-2 is one of several such clumpings of stars recently discovered in data compiled by another effort, the Dark Energy Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reticulum galaxy is one of the closest dwarfs to our own galaxy, about 100,000 light-years away. So far it is the only one in which gamma rays have been observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that observation is not unanimous. A group from <span class="companylink">Cambridge University</span> found the galaxy in the Dark Energy Survey data and shared the information with Dr. Geringer-Sameth's group, which searched the Fermi Large Area Telescope data and saw evidence for gamma rays from the galaxy. Another team, led by Alex Drlica-Wagner of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and the Dark Energy Survey as well as the Fermi telescope collaboration, independently found the galaxy and looked for gamma rays, but did not see them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So goes life in what they call the dark sector. ''This is the question to get to the bottom of, from our perspective,'' Dr. Geringer-Sameth said. ''What is causing the two analyses to reach different conclusions?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Weiner said it was far too soon to make any assumptions. ''We don't know what dark matter looks like,'' he said. ''We will need patience. But the payoff is going to be huge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: March 12, 2015, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about gamma rays observed in a distant dwarf galaxy that could be evidence of dark matter misidentified one of two groups that found the galaxy, known as Reticulum-2, in data from the Dark Energy Survey. It was a group from <span class="companylink">Cambridge University</span>, not a group led by Alex Geringer-Sameth of <span class="companylink">Carnegie Mellon University</span>. (Dr. Geringer-Sameth's group used the information to scour telescope data and produce the gamma ray observation.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars rover Curiosity appears to be suffering intermittent short circuits in its robotic arm, which could limit its drilling of rocks, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> said on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem cropped up on Feb. 27 when sensors on the rover observed a surge of current. The rover automatically stopped what it was doing and waited for further instructions from Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity had been in the middle of shaking a sample of rock powder, preparing to deliver it to an onboard chemical laboratory. That same process was used without a problem in five drilling efforts in 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a first test after the power surge, the rover retraced its steps up to the shaking. There were no problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of a second test arrived Thursday. The drill repeated the up-and-down motion 180 times and a small surge, lasting a fraction of a second, occurred during the third stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely location of the short circuit is in the coil that generates magnetic fields to move a striker that then hammers the drill, James K. Erickson, the project manager, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem does not imperil the $2.5 billion mission, and the next step is to repeat the tests so that engineers can better determine the extent and severity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the surges of current are small enough, ''we might feel comfortable with just using it until it stops moving,'' Mr. Erickson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the hammering mechanism failed, the drill would still work, though it might not be able to penetrate harder rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, that would have not been a major complication. ''The rocks are pretty soft in the areas we've seen,'' Mr. Erickson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other scientific instruments not on the arm have continued observations, and the rest of the rover is not affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity is at the base of an 18,000-foot-tall mountain. The rocks are made of layers of sediment dating to an era when Mars appears to have been warm and wet, and as the rover climbs the mountain, scientists hope that changes in the rocks will help them understand how the planet's climate changed over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission team plans to resume moving the rover's arm as early as next week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When conventional spacecraft enter orbit, they fire their engines for less than an hour to slow down and be captured by the gravity of their target.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's ''Groundhog Day'' in the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1993 Bill Murray movie, a weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again. Now astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope say they have been watching the same star blow itself to smithereens in a supernova explosion over and over again, thanks to a trick of Einsteinian optics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star exploded more than nine billion years ago on the other side of the universe, too far for even the Hubble to see without special help from the cosmos. In this case, however, light rays from the star have been bent and magnified by the gravity of an intervening cluster of galaxies so that multiple images of it appear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of them are arranged in a tight formation known as an Einstein Cross surrounding one of the galaxies in the cluster. Since each light ray follows a different path from the star to here, each image in the cross represents a slightly different moment in the supernova explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first time astronomers have been able to see the same explosion over and over again, and its unique properties may help them better understand not only the nature of these spectacular phenomena but also cosmological mysteries like dark matter and how fast the universe is expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was sort of astounded,'' said Patrick Kelly of the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, who discovered the supernova images in data recorded by the space telescope in November. ''I was not expecting anything like that at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kelly is lead author of a report describing the supernova published on Thursday in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Kirshner, a supernova expert at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> who was not involved in the work, said: ''We've seen gravitational lenses before, and we've seen supernovae before. We've even seen lensed supernovae before. But this multiple image is what we have all been hoping to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supernovas are among the most violent and rare events in the universe, occurring perhaps once per century in a typical galaxy. They outshine entire galaxies, spewing elemental particles like oxygen and gold out into space to form the foundations of new worlds, and leaving behind crushed remnants called neutron stars or black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the galaxy cluster standing between this star and the Hubble, ''basically, we got to see the supernova four times,'' Dr. Kelly said. And the explosion is expected to appear again in another part of the sky in the next 10 years. Timing the delays between its appearances, he explained, will allow astronomers to refine measurements of how fast the universe is expanding and to map the mysterious dark matter that supplies the bulk of the mass and gravitational oomph of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heavens continue to light candles for Albert Einstein. On March 14 he would have been 136, and this year marks a century since his greatest achievement, the general theory of relativity that transformed our understanding of space, time and gravity. Dr. Kelly's paper appears in a special issue of Science devoted to the anniversary of that theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein proposed that matter and energy warp the geometry of space the way a heavy body sags a mattress, producing the effect we call gravity. One consequence of this was that even light rays would be bent by gravity and follow a curved path around massive objects like the sun, as dramatically confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In effect, space itself could become a telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How this cosmic telescope works depends on how the stars are aligned. If a star and its intervening lens are slightly out of line, the distant light can appear as arcs. If they are exactly lined up, the more distant star can appear as a halo known as an Einstein ring, or as evenly separated images -- the Einstein Cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have learned how to use entire galaxies and galaxy clusters as telescopes to see fainter objects beyond them that would otherwise be lost in the fog of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble scientists have recently been using this trick in a program known as Glass, or Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space, to explore around clusters of galaxies, the most massive and thus most powerful gravitational lenses in the universe. This has enabled them to extend Hubble's already powerful vision deeper into the past, in one case to a galaxy that existed when the universe was only half a billion years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kelly's job was to inspect the images for distant supernovas. He was not expecting to see four versions of the same explosion at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They appeared in images recorded in November of a spiral galaxy roughly nine billion light-years from here. The light from this spiral has been bent and magnified both by the gravity of the intervening cluster, which is five billion light-years distant, and by one very massive galaxy in the cluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, ghost images of the spiral appear throughout the cluster and in particular in an Einstein Cross around that one galaxy. Because the lensing effect gathers light that would not otherwise be sent to our eyes or a telescope, the image of the host galaxy is not split so much as multiplied, explained Adi Zitrin, a team member from the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We simply see more appearances than we would if the lens were not present,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the supernova, named after a Norwegian astrophysicist, Sjur Refsdal, has been detected in only the four images in the Einstein cross. Based on computer modeling of the cluster, Dr. Kelly and his colleagues suspect that Supernova Refsdal has appeared before, around 1964 and 1995, in other lensed images of the spiral galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should appear again elsewhere in the same cluster within the next few years, Dr. Kelly's team predicts. The exact timing of Supernova Refsdal's reappearance depends on how the dark matter in the galaxy cluster is distributed, which will tell astronomers much about a part of the universe they cannot see any other way. The longer the path length or the stronger the gravitational field the light ray goes through, the longer the delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the expansion of the universe, the star and its galaxy are receding from us so fast that, according to relativity, clocks there appear to run markedly more slowly than clocks here. As a result, two months from the point of view of the supernova corresponds to nearly six months on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From our point of view, Dr. Kelly said, ''it's going on in slow motion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A star might die only once, but with Einstein's telescope, if you know where to look, you can watch it scream forever.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six years of planetary observations, scientists at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> say they have found convincing new evidence that ancient Mars had an ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was probably the size of the Arctic Ocean, larger than previously estimated, the researchers reported on Thursday. The body of water spread across the low-lying plain of the planet's northern hemisphere for millions of years, they said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed, the findings would add significantly to scientists' understanding of the planet's history and lend new weight to the view that ancient Mars had everything needed for life to emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The existence of a northern ocean has been debated for decades, but this is the first time we have such a strong collection of data from around the globe,'' said Michael Mumma, principal investigator at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Goddard Center for Astrobiology and an author of the report, published in the journal Science. ''Our results tell us there had to be a northern ocean.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other experts said the question was hardly resolved. The ocean remains ''a hypothesis,'' said Ashwin Vasavada, project scientist of the Curiosity rover mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mumma and Geronimo Villanueva, a planetary scientist at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, measured two slightly different forms of water in Mars' atmosphere. One is the familiar H2O, which consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other is a slightly ''heavier'' version of water, HDO, in which the nucleus of one hydrogen atom contains a neutron. The atom is called deuterium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two forms exist in predictable ratios on Earth, and both have been found in meteorites from Mars. A high level of heavier water today would indicate that there was once a lot more of the ''lighter'' water, somehow lost as the planet changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists found eight times as much deuterium in the Martian atmosphere than is found in water on Earth. Dr. Villanueva said the findings ''provide a solid estimate of how much water Mars once had by determining how much water was lost to space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the measurements pointed to an ancient Mars that had enough water to cover the planet to a depth of at least 137 meters, or about 450 feet. Except for assessments based on the size of the northern basin, this is the highest estimate of the amount of water on early Mars that scientists have ever made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water on Mars mostly would have pooled in the northern hemisphere, which lies one to three kilometers -- 0.6 to 1.8 miles -- below the bedrock surface of the south, the scientists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, the researchers estimated, a northern ocean would have covered about 19 percent of the Martian surface. In comparison, the Atlantic Ocean covers about 17 percent of Earth's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new findings come at a time when the possibility of a northern ocean on Mars has gained renewed attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Curiosity rover measured lighter and heavier water molecules in the Gale Crater, and the data also indicated that Mars once had substantial amounts of water, although not as much as Dr. Mumma and Dr. Villanueva suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more water was present -- and especially if it was a large body of water that lasted for a longer period of time -- the better the chances are for life to emerge and to be sustained,'' said Paul Mahaffy, chief of the atmospheric experiments laboratory at the Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last month, the science team running the Curiosity rover held its first formal discussion about the possibility of such an ocean and what it would have meant for the rest of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists generally agree that lakes must have existed for millions of years in Gale Crater and elsewhere. But it is not clear how they were sustained and replenished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For open lakes to remain relatively stable for millions of years -- it's hard to figure how to do that without an ocean,'' Dr. Vasavada said. ''Unless there was a large body of water supplying humidity to the planet, the water in an open lake would quickly evaporate and be carried to the polar caps or frozen out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet climate modelers have had difficulty understanding how Mars could have been warm enough in its early days to keep water from freezing. Greenhouse gases could have made the planet much warmer at some point, but byproducts of those gases have yet to be found on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Head, a professor of geological sciences at <span class="companylink">Brown University</span>, said in an email that the new paper had ''profound implications for the total volume of water'' on ancient Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, ''climate models have great difficulty in reconstructing an early Mars with temperatures high enough to permit surface melting and liquid water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also missing are clear signs of the topographic and geological features associated with large bodies of water on Earth, such as sea cliffs and shorelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on low-resolution images sent back by the Viking landers, the geologist Timothy Parker and his colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab reported in 1989 the discovery of ancient shorelines. But later high-resolution images undermined their conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Dr. Parker and his colleagues have kept looking for -- and finding, they say -- some visible signs of a northern ocean. The new data ''certainly encourages me to do more,'' he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other researchers have also been looking for signs of an ancient ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, Roman DiBiase, then a postdoctoral student at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span>, and Michael Lamb, an assistant professor of geology there, identified what might have been a system of channels on Mars that originated in the southern hemisphere and emptied steeply into the northern basin -- perhaps, they said, water flowing through a delta to an ocean.</p>

But the treaty is less clear on what a company or an individual can do in space -- possibly because in the 1960s, the drafters of the treaty might have thought it hard to imagine a space race led by entrepreneurs rather than governments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a chicken-egg conundrum to create a lunar legal framework,'' said John Thornton, the chief executive of Astrobotic Technology, a Pittsburgh company that hopes to become the first private company to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon and win the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize. ''How do you get businesses to invest in the moon if there is no legal framework versus how do you get a legal framework if there are no business operations?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, which licenses private space launchings in the United States, has now provided some clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reply to a request by <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> of North Las Vegas, Nev., one of those space entrepreneurs, the F.A.A. said it would make sure that American companies did not interfere with one another on the moon or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We recognize the private sector's need to protect its assets and personnel on the moon or on other celestial bodies,'' wrote George C. Nield, the agency's associate administrator for commercial space transportation, in a letter dated Dec. 22. The Reuters news service reported on the letter last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigelow is developing inflatable habitats for outer space, and this year, a small Bigelow structure is to be added to the International Space Station. In the coming years, it plans to launch larger inflatables as private space stations to be leased by companies or nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2013, Bigelow asked the F.A.A. to review a proposal for landing one of its habitats on the moon for use as a lunar base. Bigelow said it might conduct scientific research or commercial endeavors like mining. Robert Bigelow, the company's founder, has said he is aiming to establish his lunar base around 2025, and the company wanted to start clarifying issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's best to avoid these problems now, before operations begin,'' said Michael Gold, Bigelow's D.C. director of operations and business growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its proposal, Bigelow suggested that the F.A.A. leverage its authority to review payloads and license launchings. In essence, Bigelow requested that the F.A.A. agree not to issue a license to another American company that would land at the same place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The action does not bestow ownership of the moon on Bigelow or anyone else, and the F.A.A. does not have jurisdiction over foreign companies. But with the F.A.A.'s issuing licenses to American companies, Mr. Gold said the State Department could more easily work out agreements with other countries regulating their private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't have that agency and that paper, then it becomes a Wild West scenario,'' Mr. Gold said. ''This decision has real immediate and real impact on investors who require security and predictability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gold said the F.A.A.'s decision did not violate the Outer Space Treaty and actually helped fulfill the United States' obligations under the part of the treaty that states, ''The activities of nongovernmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate state party to the treaty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is less clear is whether private companies can profit from the moon or other places in space. A follow-up international agreement in 1979, the Moon Treaty, emphatically said no, banning ownership of the moon and other celestial bodies, and declaring that the moon's riches were to be shared among nations, especially developing countries. But many nations, including the United States, Russia and China, have not signed the treaty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Congress last year, Representatives Bill Posey, Republican of Florida, and Derek Kilmer, Democrat of Washington, introduced a bill called the Asteroids Act, which would give companies ownership over any material they mined from asteroids. At least two American companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, have announced plans to mine asteroids. After a House subcommittee hearing in September, the bill did not progress, but a spokesman for Mr. Posey said it would be reintroduced this year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDIt is a fact rarely appreciated by the general public that to professional astronomers, the Sun is a pretty boring star. Which in fact is great news for the rest of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't oscillate or explode, periodically scorching us or freezing us out. In all of recorded history, as far as scientists have been able to tell, the sun's output has varied by only a tenth of a percent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is still a star that we live with, and stars can be temperamental -- ask any Hollywood agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our star is an enormous thermonuclear furnace more than a million times as big as Earth. At its center, where the temperature is 15 million degrees, 600 million tons of hydrogen are fused into 596 million tons of helium every second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The missing four million tons are transformed into energy. They become sunshine; they are the mortgage payment for life on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a slight change in this precariously controlled violence can have drastic consequences on Earth. And so astronomers have been keeping careful watch on the sun in recent years as the number of sunspots blotting its surface approached an 11-year peak in 2014, ushering in what is often a season of dangerous storms on the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glimpsed in the light of glowing hydrogen, the solar surface seethes and bubbles like boiling oatmeal. Guided by intense magnetic fields, jets of gas rise and fall like rain along arcs that can reach far into the corona, a thin haze of million-degree electrified gas visible during solar eclipses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called sunspots, which look dark only compared with the brilliance of the disk around them, occur in some regions where intense magnetic fields choke off the rising energy. They wax and wane in concert with the sun's magnetic field, which reverses its direction every 11 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every sunspot cycle is slightly different and unpredictable. For the last half of the 17th century and partway into the next, sunspots nearly disappeared from the sun. That period corresponded to a prolonged era of European winters known as the Little Ice Age, and some astronomers have suggested there is a connection between low magnetic and sunspot activity and cooler temperatures on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with high sunspot numbers comes a greater frequency of storms known as solar flares that can rattle the entire solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent observations with <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Solar Dynamics Observatory have detailed how magnetic lines of force can snap like overstretched rubber bands, releasing as much energy as 160 billion hydrogen bombs on the sun's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These explosions can launch monstrous globs of high-energy particles and radiation into space. Radiation from these storms is one of the major health threats that astronauts could face on the long voyage to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When such a glob of gas hits our planet, Earth's magnetosphere cushions the blow. High-energy particles are funneled to the magnetic poles, where they create the dazzling displays known as the Northern or Southern Lights. But they can also wreak electrical havoc, causing blackouts and blinding satellites crucial to modern life and the national defense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solar flare in 1859 produced auroral lights as far south as Hawaii and set telegraphs sparking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunspots recently peaked again in 2014 and are still dangerously high. So far the planet has escaped any direct hits this time around, but scientists are keeping a weather eye on the good old sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living with a star is exciting, but it requires eternal vigilance for the inevitable outbursts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online Correction: February 4, 2015, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the sun compared with Earth. The sun is more than a million times as big as Earth, not millions of times as big. It also misstated the timeframe on which the sun's magnetic field reverses. It reverses direction every 11 years, not 22.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thick cables snaked across the floor of the Hall of the Universe one recent evening. Not far from a 10-foot-tall pitted tooth of iron known as the Willamette Meteorite, a semicircle of cafe tables was set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the corner, behind tables holding video and computer equipment, was a bar and buffet. Holding court in the center of the crowd, in a blazer and bluejeans and a tie garishly illustrated with astronomical images, was Neil deGrasse Tyson, the ebullient director of the Hayden Planetarium at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span> in New York City -- or, as he likes to describe himself to audiences, ''your personal astrophysicist.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blogosphere was going crazy, he declared, looming over me and grabbing my shoulders. ''They're saying Neil is going to take over late-night TV,'' he laughed. He said he had been approached to go on Conan O'Brien's show, where a year ago he had enthused about dying in a black hole and pointed out that everything about a crescent moon that hangs over the city on the show's set was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The occasion, in the museum's Rose Center for Earth and Space, was the taping of a couple of episodes of Dr. Tyson's new television show, ''StarTalk.'' Based on the long-running radio show and podcast of the same name, now in its seventh season, it is billed as the first science-based TV talk show. Or as Helen Matsos, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astrobiologist and ''StarTalk'' producer, put it, ''The Daily Show'' meets ''Car Talk'' meets ''Cosmos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are lots of channels for people who know they like science,'' Dr. Tyson said. ''This is a show for people who don't know they like science -- or know they don't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time we saw him in prime time, last spring, Dr. Tyson was flying around the universe on a letter-opener-shaped spaceship as the host of the born-again ''Cosmos,'' slipping on sunglasses with a sly smile to experience the Big Bang. For those who have relished Dr. Tyson in a more spontaneous mode, holding forth as a guest of Bill Maher or Jay Leno or needling his fellow physicists during debates at the museum, this is a chance to see him at his unscripted best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the second in a series of tapings for shows that will start on the <span class="companylink">National Geographic</span> Channel in April. About 30 people, mostly museum employees, had been invited to eat, drink and applaud enthusiastically as the live audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At tapings of prime-time shows like ''The Big Bang Theory,'' there is a person in charge of keeping the audience warmed up and excited during breaks in the action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On ''StarTalk,'' the warmer-upper is Dr. Tyson himself, who began by teasing a reporter in the first row for being the only one not wearing black. He ruminated on the movies. Until recently, he said, most sci-fi films were ''people go into space and something goes wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sitcoms like ''The Big Bang Theory'' and movies like ''The Theory of Everything'' and ''The Imitation Game,'' both nominated for multiple Academy Awards, have opened ''a new portal,'' Dr. Tyson said. In ''Interstellar,'' he noted, five major stars play scientists who do not endanger civilization, but save it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon Dr. Tyson and his guests, Janna Levin, a cosmologist, novelist and professor at <span class="companylink">Barnard College</span>, and Eugene Mirman, a comedian in the animated series ''Bob's Burgers'' and a frequent wingman on the ''Star Talk'' podcast, were perched on stools. We applauded wildly as Dr. Tyson wound up his opening pitch. ''StarTalk,'' he intoned in a deep voice, ''where science and popular culture collide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subject was black holes, the Einsteinian monsters from which not even light can escape and which form the centerpiece of ''Interstellar,'' Christopher Nolan's epic movie about astronauts who travel through a wormhole to another galaxy in search of a new home for humanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is the entrance to a black hole called a throat? Dr. Tyson wondered at one point. ''It's creepy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversation was interspersed with clips from an interview with Mr. Nolan, shown on a bank of screens usually used to present images like Hubble Space Telescope pictures to museumgoers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During another break, Dr. Tyson recalled that he had written a rhyme about black holes. He started to recite it: ''In a feet-first dive to this cosmic abyss...''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he scrunched his face in agony. ''I forgot the last stanza.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He tried again, and could not remember it. The show went on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, two wine glasses minding their own business at the feet of those stools were smashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Dr. Tyson had wrapped the first episode, someone had fetched the poem, ''Death by Black Hole,'' from <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Dr. Tyson tried again, then again with rhythm as the audience members snapped their fingers in time:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a feet-first dive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To this cosmic abyss</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will not survive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because you surely will not miss</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tidal forces of gravity will create quite a calamity when you're stretched head to toe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you sure you wanna go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your body's atoms -- you'll see them -- will enter one by one</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singularity will eat 'em, and of course, you won't be having fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then it was time for selfies, and for sweeping up the broken glass.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists will have to wait a while longer to find out what kicked off the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, a team of astronomers who go by the name of Bicep announced that they had detected ripples in space-time, or gravitational waves, reverberating from the first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second of time -- long-sought evidence that the expansion of the universe had started out with a giant whoosh called inflation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was heralded as potentially the greatest of the new century, but after months of spirited debate, the group conceded that the result could have been caused by interstellar dust, a notion buttressed by subsequent measurements by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Planck satellite that the part of the sky Bicep examined was in fact dusty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a new analysis, undertaken jointly by the Bicep group and the Planck group, has confirmed that the Bicep signal was mostly, if not all, stardust, and that there is no convincing evidence of the gravitational waves. No evidence of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This analysis shows that the amount of gravitational waves can probably be no more than about half the observed signal,'' Clem Pryke of the <span class="companylink">University of Minnesota</span> said Friday in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't say with any certainty whether any gravity wave signals remain,'' Dr. Pryke added. ''Obviously, we're not exactly thrilled, but we are scientists and our job is to try and uncover the truth. In the scientific process, the truth will emerge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the galactic dust is correctly subtracted, the scientists said, there was indeed a small excess signal -- a glimmer of hope for inflation fans? -- but it was too small to tell if it was because of gravitational waves or just experimental noise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bicep/Planck analysis was led by Dr. Pryke, one of the four Bicep principal investigators. Brendan Crill, of the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> and a member of Planck, acted as a liaison between the groups. They had planned to post their paper Monday, but the data was posted early, apparently by accident. It was soon taken down, but not before it set off an outburst of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> messages and hasty news releases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A paper is to be posted to the Bicep website and has been submitted to the journal Physical Review Letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will be far from the final word. A flotilla of experiments devoted to the cause are underway, studying a thin haze of microwaves, known as cosmic background radiation, left from the Big Bang, when the cosmos was about 380,000 years old. Among them is a sister experiment to Bicep called Spider, led by Bill Jones of Princeton and involving a balloon-borne telescope that just completed a trip around Antarctica, as well as Bicep's own Keck Array and the recently installed Bicep3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake is an idea that has galvanized cosmologists since Alan Guth of the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> invented it in 1979. Inflation theory holds that the universe had a violent and brief surge of expansion in the earliest moments, driven by a mysterious force field that exerted negative gravity. It would explain such things as why the universe looks so uniform and where galaxies come from -- quantum dents in the inflating cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such an explosion would have left faint corkscrew swirls, known technically as B-modes, in the pattern of polarization of the microwaves. So, however, does interstellar dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bicep group -- its name is an acronym for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization -- is led by John M. Kovac of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>; Jamie Bock of Caltech; Dr. Pryke; and Chao-Lin Kuo of Stanford. They have deployed a series of radio telescopes at the South Pole in search of the swirl pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their second scope, Bicep2, detected a signal whose strength was in the sweet spot for some of the most popular models of inflation, leading to a sensational news conference attended by Dr. Guth and Andrei Linde, two of the founding fathers of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was before critics raised the dust question. Moreover, that result was contrary to a previous limit on the strength of gravitational waves obtained by the Planck satellite, which has scanned the entire microwave sky in search of the Big Bang's secrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planck observed the microwaves in nine frequencies, making it easy to distinguish dust. Bicep2 had only one frequency and lacked access to Planck's data until last fall, when the two groups agreed to work together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bock of Caltech, in an interview at the end of what he called a long, stressful day, characterized the result as ''no detectable signal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not discouraged,'' he went on. ''We're going to have to have better data to get a definitive answer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email, Paul J. Steinhardt, a Princeton cosmologist who was a founder of inflation but turned against it in favor of his own theory of a cyclic bouncing universe, said the new results left cosmologists back where they were before Bicep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Linde noted that there was evidence in the new analysis for a gravitational wave signal, albeit at a level significantly lower than Bicep had reported. ''This is what all of us realized almost a year ago, and it did not change,'' he said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earlier Planck result limiting gravitational waves, he said, had inspired a firestorm of theorizing, in which he and others produced a whole new class of theories relating not just to inflation, but to dark energy as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So yes, we are very excited, and no, the theory did not become more contrived,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Max Tegmark, an M.I.T. expert on the cosmic microwaves, said, ''It's important to remember that inflation is still alive and well, and that many of the simplest models predict signals just below this new limit.'' The next few years will be interesting, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>, said he could appreciate the frustration of his colleagues, who have been wandering in the wilderness for nearly four decades looking for clues to the Beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inflation is the most important idea in cosmology since the hot Big Bang,'' he said. ''It is our Helen of Troy, launching a thousand experiments.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDTo sail on winds of sunlight has long been a dream of rocket scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Planetary Society</span>, a nonprofit that promotes space exploration, announced Monday that it would send the first of two small spacecraft testing the technology of solar sails into orbit this May, tagging along with other small satellites on an Atlas 5 rocket.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We strongly believe this could be a big part of the future of interplanetary missions,'' said William Sanford Nye -- better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy -- the chief executive of the organization. ''It will ultimately eventually take a lot of missions a long, long way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When photons -- particles of light -- bounce off a shiny surface, they impart a tiny bit of momentum, an effect that comes directly from the equations of electromagnetism published by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s. In his 1865 novel, ''From the Earth to the Moon,'' Jules Verne appears to have been the first to realize that this force could be harnessed for travel through the solar system. The bombardment of sunlight over a large area can gradually but continuously accelerate a spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On launching, the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>'s craft, LightSail, is about the size of a loaf of bread -- 4 inches by 4 inches by 1 foot. In orbit, the spacecraft will undergo a month of testing before it extends four 13-foot-long booms and unfurls four triangular pieces of Mylar, less than 1/5,000th of an inch thick, to form a square sail that spans almost 345 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The May flight is to check that the sail deployment and other systems work as designed. But at the altitude that LightSail will be flying -- the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span> cannot say how high, because the Atlas 5's main payload is a military satellite -- the drag of air hitting the sail will be greater than the pressure of light, and the spacecraft will drop out of orbit and burn up in a few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, a second LightSail is to be lofted higher, to an altitude of 450 miles, by a Falcon Heavy rocket from <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corp</span>., or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. That flight is to be the first to demonstrate controlled solar sailing while in orbit around Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea ultimately is to be able to tack like a sailboat on each orbit,'' said Mr. Nye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both LightSails were built for less than $4 million, financed entirely by private citizens, Mr. Nye said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> considered solar sails in the 1970s for a mission to meet up with Halley's comet in 1986. That spacecraft would have been huge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial design called for a square sail roughly half a mile on a side -- an area of almost 7 million square feet -- to be deployed from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s space shuttle. That was swapped for a design the engineers had more confidence in -- a dozen rectangular sails, each 25 feet wide and more than four miles long, arrayed like helicopter blades that spun slowly to generate enough centrifugal force to keep the sails stretched out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the immense sails were regarded as too risky a technological jump. ''It was very audacious for its time,'' said Louis D. Friedman, who was the engineer at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory leading the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of delays and cost overruns with the space shuttle program, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> ended up canceling the Halley's comet mission, and sails fell out of favor at the space agency. ''There was a visceral negative reaction to solar sailing,'' Dr. Friedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span> collaborated with Russian scientists on a solar sail spacecraft called Cosmos 1, raising $4 million from members. ''I said, now we have a chance to realistically do something,'' said Dr. Friedman, who left <span class="companylink">NASA</span> in 1980 and helped found the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>, serving as its executive director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmos 1 launched in June 2005 from a Russian nuclear submarine. But the rocket failed, and Cosmos 1 was lost before the sail could be tested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of attempting to build another Cosmos 1, the society turned to something smaller -- LightSail -- taking advantage of a new generation of cheaper, miniaturized satellites known as CubeSats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a more accessible, easier-to-build gizmo,'' Mr. Nye said. ''You don't need a whole space agency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in solar sails also revived at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, which successfully tested its own CubeSat, NanoSail-D, in 2011, demonstrating how a sail could be used to nudge decommissioned satellites out of orbit back into the atmosphere instead of adding to the accumulation of space junk circling Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other <span class="companylink">NASA</span> CubeSats with solar sails could head into space with the first launching of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s new heavylift rocket, the Space Launch System, expected in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One, Lunar Flashlight, will use a solar sail not only for propulsion but also to reflect sunlight into shadowed craters near the moon's poles. That will allow a look at ice deposits at the bottom of the craters. The other, NEA Scout, is to visit a near-Earth asteroid. The space probes will cost about $15 million each, far less than most <span class="companylink">NASA</span> space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan has already sent a solar sail on an interplanetary voyage. Its Ikaros spacecraft, short for Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation of the Sun, launched in May 2010 and passed by Venus later that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert L. Staehle is among those at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory brainstorming additional concepts like sun-watching CubeSats that could give three days' additional warning of a ferocious solar storm that could knock out power grids on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar sails save the weight and expense of lugging fuel, helping reduce the price tag of the sun-watching mission to less than $100 million, Mr. Staehle said, less than a fifth of the cost of a larger, more conventional approach using thrusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is a small, solar sail-driven spacecraft looping between Earth and Mars, a possible precursor to cargo ships lugging supplies to astronauts living on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, sails could take us to the stars. Sunlight would be too weak for that trip, but a giant laser aimed at a gigantic sail could provide the necessary acceleration. Neither lasers or sails large enough exist today, but in Dr. Friedman's opinion, ''it is the only technology that leads to interstellar,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, the foundation announced a more ambitious prize to spur private endeavors farther out. The <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize would award $20 million to the first team that could land on the moon an unmanned spacecraft that would then move at least 1,640 feet across the lunar surface and send back photographs and videos.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foundation also rejiggered how the money would be paid. Instead of waiting for a successful completion of the feat, it decided to offer partial payments to teams for their efforts.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet giant, along with Fidelity, has invested $1 billion in <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span> (<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>), the private rocketry company founded by Elon Musk. The move could help <span class="companylink">Google</span> achieve its aim of bringing satellite Internet to remote corners of the world while giving <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> more money for its founder to pursue dreams of going to Mars.</p>

Last year, <span class="companylink">Google</span> bought Skybox Imaging, a maker of small, high-resolution imaging satellites, for about $500 million. <span class="companylink">Google</span> already offers satellite imagery in its <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth product, but must purchase these images from multiple sources, often receiving what company executives have said is uneven image quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> may also be interested in developing satellites with other kinds of sensors, like infrared detectors that show the health of crops, or lasers that can pierce forest canopies to show underlying terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>'s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both personally interested in space exploration. Early in the company's history it offered employee lectures on building so-called space elevators that could theoretically launch objects off Earth more cheaply than rockets could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More practically, the company has been trying to transform the Internet connectivity business with high-altitude balloons that people can use to get online from remote locations. That same transmission technology could conceivably be put on satellites as well. <span class="companylink">Google</span> is in competition with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which is also interested in advanced means of connectivity and which last year purchased a drone company whose products are potentially capable of carrying Internet devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> and Fidelity will collectively own 10 percent of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> because of the investment, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said in statement.</p>

Mr. Harrison will join the board of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this investment, <span class="companylink">Google</span> is hopping on a crowded bandwagon. Last week, <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span>, along with <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span>, a maker of communications semiconductors, announced they had invested in a constellation of 648 Internet connectivity satellites. Also on Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Planet Labs</span>, a maker of shoebox-size satellites that offer Earth imagery, announced it had received $95 million in financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> grew out of Mr. Musk's desire to land plants -- the green, photosynthesizing type of plants -- on the surface of Mars. As Mr. Musk tells the story, he started looking for feasible rockets, but found the pickings to be too risky or too expensive, so decided to start his own rocket company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It almost went out of business. The first three launches of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s small Falcon 1 rocket from Kwajalein Atoll, a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, failed. But after a successful launch in September 2008, the company was able to continue development of the larger Falcon 9 rocket, part of a contract from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to develop the capability for taking cargo to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is sort of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Airlines</span> of rocket launchers -- reliable and cheap. So far, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> represents the biggest slice of the company's business. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has a $1.6 billion contract for space station cargo and last year won a $2.6 billion contract to fly astronauts to the station beginning in 2017. It also has contracts to launch commercial satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the company has come close to innovative breakthroughs, almost landing the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean. The company is also planning the inaugural launch of its much bigger Falcon Heavy rocket this year, two years behind the original schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is not clear how <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> could obtain the financial resources to fulfill Mr. Musk's more ambitious pronouncement, which is that the company would take people to Mars in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company could raise a large pot of capital through an I.P.O. -- that is, if shareholders would countenance such an extraordinarily expensive venture with uncertain payoffs far off in the future. Mr. Musk has said <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would remain privately held for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even with its successes, the company has not launched as many rockets as quickly as it promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Google</span> investment appears to be a different approach: to bring in an influx of dollars without Mr. Musk yielding ironclad control.</p>

Gross, the American released last month after five years of captivity in Cuba, and Scott Kelly, an astronaut scheduled to leave soon for a year aboard the International Space Station, will be among President Obama's guests at this week's State of the Union address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other guests will include a wounded Afghanistan war veteran, a doctor fighting Ebola in Africa, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">CVS Health</span>, a young immigrant allowed to stay in the country under an order by Mr. Obama, and several people who overcame difficult upbringings in places like Compton and the South Bronx.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House announced the guest list on Monday, a day before Mr. Obama is scheduled to address a joint session of <span class="companylink">Congress</span> and a national television audience to lay out an agenda for his seventh year in office. Ever since Ronald Reagan, presidents have invited guests to sit in the first lady's box at <span class="companylink">the Capitol</span>, with an eye to making symbolic points during their speeches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross, who will be accompanied by his wife, Judy, was an American government contractor working in Cuba when he was arrested in 2009. He was later sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison for trying to deliver satellite telephone equipment. He was released last month as part of a deal between Mr. Obama and President Raúl Castro of Cuba that will also restore full diplomatic relations between the countries for the first time in more than half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly, an astronaut since 1996 who has spent a total of more than 180 days at the space station, will head back up in March, this time to stay for a year, the first American astronaut to do so. Scientists will compare his medical status over that year with that of his twin brother, Mark Kelly, another astronaut, who will remain on the ground. Mark Kelly has become a prominent gun control advocate since his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in the head in 2011 while a congresswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in the box with Michelle Obama will be Dr. Pranav Shetty, the global emergency health coordinator for the International Medical Corps, who spent months fighting Ebola in Liberia. Nearby will be Larry J. Merlo, the <span class="companylink">CVS Health</span> chief, whose stores eliminated tobacco sales last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president will use his guests to highlight a push for better policing after last year's tumult in Ferguson, Mo., following a white police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man. Sitting with Mrs. Obama will be Capt. Phillip C. Tingirides of the Los Angeles Police Department, who leads a program that has helped Watts fight crime and promote better relations between officers and the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obamas will also highlight those working to overcome backgrounds of poverty and crime. One guest, Prophet Walker, who served a six-year sentence for robbery, helped found a program to help inmates get an education to avoid the revolving door of prison. Another guest, Anthony Mendez, who grew up in the South Bronx in a family that was homeless for a time and whose best friend was murdered, managed to finish high school and attend to college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make a point in a running battle with Republicans over immigration, Mr. Obama invited Ana Zamora, who was allowed to stay in the country under a 2012 program to end the risk of deportation for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally while they were children. The House this month voted to try to reverse that program as part of broader legislation aimed at undercutting an executive action signed by Mr. Obama to allow millions more immigrants to remain in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president also invited Jason Gibson, who lost both legs in Afghanistan and first met Mr. Obama in 2012 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Despite 21 operations and being unable to use prosthetics, Mr. Gibson took up surfing and skiing, completed marathons on a hand cycle and obtained a pilot's license, the White House said.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> spacecraft will arrive there to begin the first close-up examination of a dwarf planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is instead Ceres, 600 miles wide, the largest of the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. ''We're going to reveal the fascinating details of a giant world of rock and ice,'' said Marc Rayman, the chief engineer for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Dawn spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not like we're just going out to visit a chunk of rock the size of one of those mountains,'' he said, pointing to the San Gabriel Mountains outside the windows at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ''Ceres has 38 percent of the area of the continental United States. It's actually the largest body between the sun and Pluto that a spacecraft has not yet visited.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the Herschel Space Observatory discovered water vapor rising off two spots on Ceres, possibly a sign of ice volcanism. ''Ceres may have subsurface ponds or lakes or even oceans of water,'' Dr. Rayman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the year, the bigger and much more famous dwarf planet Pluto will have its close-up when <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft zips past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These missions, years in the works, are expected to let loose a flood of data that will help paint clearer pictures of Ceres and Pluto and uncover clues on the origins of our solar system. They will also rekindle the debate over what constitutes a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The encounter phase of the New Horizons mission officially began Thursday, 180 days before the spacecraft's closest approach July 14. New Horizons, launched in 2006 on a three-billion-mile trip to Pluto, came out of hibernation in December and is still 135 million miles away, closing in at a speed of more than 30,000 miles per hour. It will start photographing Pluto on Sunday, and by May, those photographs will be sharper than the sharpest taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From there on in, it gets dramatically better, week by week,'' said S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons. At closest approach, 7,800 miles above the surface, the images will have a resolution of about 70 meters per pixel. If New Horizons were passing over Manhattan instead of Pluto, ''we could count the ponds in Central Park,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto's demotion from planethood in 2006 left fuzzy notions of what a planet is and is not. The <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>, the organization in charge of astronomy nomenclature and names, invented a new category, dwarf planets, to place Pluto and Eris, an object discovered a decade ago that is a virtual twin of Pluto in size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More controversially and confusingly, the group decreed that dwarf planets -- Ceres was promoted from asteroid at the same time -- were not planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern is not shy about calling the current definition stupid, saying the ''I'' in ''I.A.U.'' actually stands for ''irrelevant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They got it really wrong,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc W. Buie, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., and a member of the New Horizons team, agrees with Dr. Stern but wishes the issue would go away. Years ago, people would be fascinated to hear the scientific puzzles about Pluto. Now, conversations usually start with ''Is Pluto a planet?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very annoying, distracting issue,'' Dr. Buie said. ''You have to get past this wall of this nonscientific issue before you get to the good things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of good things for scientists to figure out. Why did Pluto, which had had a consistent reddish hue since Clyde Tombaugh spotted it in 1930, suddenly turn redder from 2000 to 2002? It has stayed the redder color since then. Why, as Pluto moves away from the sun, has the atmosphere not frozen and fallen to the ground as many scientists thought it might? How many moons circle Pluto? Could it have rings like Saturn? For decades, astronomers knew of only one moon, Charon, but Hubble has spied four more: Hydra, Nix, Styx and Kerberos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists already have ideas about what is going on at Pluto. Dr. Buie said the color change could be the result of the northern pole now being in continual sunlight of summer, burning off the shiny veneer. Computer models have suggested how the surface of Pluto is retaining enough heat to keep its air from freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the simple question of Pluto's size does not have a precise answer yet because the atmosphere bends light. The exact size is crucial to working out the dynamics of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris, farther out and colder, does not have an atmosphere, and its size was measured when a star passed behind it in 2010 -- 1,445 miles wide, give or take four miles. Dr. Buie said that estimates for Pluto's diameter range from 1,429 miles to 1,454 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all going to be fantastic,'' Dr. Buie said. ''I'm interested in seeing every single result, every measurement, every byte of information that's going to come out of that spacecraft.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ceres was discovered, in 1801, it was added to the roster of planets. Within six years, three more objects were spotted in the region -- Pallas, Juno and Vesta -- bringing the number of planets to 11. (In the outer solar system, Neptune and Pluto had not yet been discovered.) But as astronomers found more and more asteroids, they thought it was ridiculous for every little rock between Mars and Jupiter to be called a planet. The rocks became asteroids, not planets. Ceres lingered for decades on some drawings of the solar system, but it was eventually forgotten, even by most astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost no one cared much that Ceres was round and not a planet until round Pluto suddenly became a nonplanet, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The common notion of planet is ''a big thing orbiting the sun.'' When Pluto was discovered, it was thought to be larger than Earth, but turned out to be just 1/450th the mass of Earth -- smaller than our moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> attempted to codify the ''big'' aspect by stating that a full-fledged planet ''has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit,'' while a dwarf planet needs only to be large enough that its gravity has pulled it into a roundish shape, what physicists call hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even many scientists who like the notion underlying the ''cleared the neighborhood'' clause -- essentially that a planet is the gravitationally dominant object in its orbit -- said that the I.A.U. did not explain itself very well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's trying to be right, but it's written terribly,'' said Michael E. Brown, the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> astronomer who found Eris, setting off the events culminating in Pluto's demotion. Dr. Brown is not shy about expressing his opinions, either. His 2010 book is titled ''How I Killed Pluto, and Why It Had It Coming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, Dr. Stern and Christopher T. Russell, a planetary scientist at U.C.L.A. who is the principal investigator for the Dawn mission, focus more on the intrinsic properties rather than gravitational interactions with other bodies. Once a body is large enough to become round, heavier elements like iron sink to the core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vesta, which Dawn studied before heading to Ceres, has some planetlike features, although it is more potato than sphere in shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If all of the scientific community starts referring to Vesta and Ceres and Pluto as planets, then eventually everyone will come along,'' Dr. Russell said. ''We're going to let the bodies speak for themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple change advocated by many Pluto fans would be to eliminate the ''cleared the neighborhood'' requirement. That would add not only Pluto and Ceres, but also two other icy worlds discovered beyond Neptune by Dr. Brown -- Haumea and Makemake -- that are large enough to be roundish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern goes further. If a planet is defined by its physical properties, not its dynamical ones, then anything round but not a star, is a planet regardless of where it is. ''Some of them orbit other planets,'' he said. ''Get over it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a widely mocked video clip that circulated last week, Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer, and Shawn Killinger, a host on the QVC shopping channel, discuss the colorful patterns of a blouse -- ''It almost kind of looks like what the Earth does when you're a bazillion miles from the planet moon,'' Ms. Killinger says, then reverses to say that the moon is not a planet -- and they end up squabbling over the astronomical definitions of moon, planet, sun and star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The moon is such a planet I can't even stand it," Mr. Mizrahi says, exasperated. "Well, what else is it if it's not a planet?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Dr. Stern's definition, Mr. Mizrahi would win the argument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am happy to defend him,'' Dr. Stern said via email Sunday. ''I see no logical reason why large moons that are in hydrostatic equilibrium should not be considered planets too, and I call them that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern's classification system distinguishes moons as ''secondary planets,'' while ''primary planets'' directly orbit around the sun -- pushing the number of planets in the solar system to more than 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even some New Horizons scientists who agree Pluto should be a planet disagree with Dr. Stern. ''No, I don't count the moon as a planet,'' said Catherine Olkin, the deputy project scientist. ''I guess, where do we stop?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no indication that the I.A.U. will revisit the planet question when it meets in Honolulu in August. Astronomers there could propose a new definition, but Thierry Montmerle, the general secretary of the organization, said, ''The vast majority of the international planetary community has clearly accepted this definition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, passions seem to be cooling over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown said he rarely heard Pluto complaints these days, but about a decade ago, he regularly received vulgar phone calls. ''They were generally calling me names that were sufficiently rude that I can't say them,'' Dr. Brown said, ''and some of them were sufficiently rude that I didn't know what it meant, and I had to ask my grad students, and they often wouldn't tell me, because they were too busy rolling on the floor laughing.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUR galaxy, the Milky Way, is home to almost 300 billion stars, and over the last decade, astronomers have made a startling discovery -- almost all those stars have planets. The fact that nearly every pinprick of light you see in the night sky hosts a family of worlds raises a powerful but simple question: ''Where is everybody?'' Hundreds of billions of planets translate into a lot of chances for evolving intelligent, technologically sophisticated species. So why don't we see evidence for E.T.s everywhere?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The physicist Enrico Fermi first formulated this question, now called the Fermi paradox, in 1950. But in the intervening decades, humanity has recognized that our own climb up the ladder of technological sophistication comes with a heavy price. From climate change to resource depletion, our evolution into a globe-spanning industrial culture is forcing us through the narrow bottleneck of a sustainability crisis. In the wake of this realization, new and sobering answers to Fermi's question now seem possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe we're not the only ones to hit a sustainability bottleneck. Maybe not everyone -- maybe no one -- makes it to the other side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Fermi's day, scientists have gained a new perspective on life in its planetary context. From the vantage point of this relatively new field, astrobiology, our current sustainability crisis may be neither politically contingent nor unique, but a natural consequence of laws governing how planets and life of any kind, anywhere, must interact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defining feature of a technological civilization is the capacity to intensively ''harvest'' energy. But the basic physics of energy, heat and work known as thermodynamics tell us that waste, or what we physicists call entropy, must be generated and dumped back into the environment in the process. Human civilization currently harvests around 100 billion megawatt hours of energy each year and dumps 36 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the planetary system, which is why the atmosphere is holding more heat and the oceans are acidifying. As hard as it is for some to believe, we humans are now steering the planet, however poorly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can we generalize this kind of planetary hijacking to other worlds? The long history of Earth provides a clue. The oxygen you are breathing right now was not part of our original atmosphere. It was the so-called Great Oxidation Event, two billion years after the formation of the planet, that drove Earth's atmospheric content of oxygen up by a factor of 10,000. What cosmic force could so drastically change an entire planet's atmosphere? Nothing more than the respiratory excretions of anaerobic bacteria then dominating our world. The one gas we most need to survive originated as deadly pollution to our planet's then-leading species: a simple bacterium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Oxidation Event alone shows that when life (intelligent or otherwise) becomes highly successful, it can dramatically change its host planet. And what is true here is likely to be true on other planets as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But can we predict how an alien industrial civilization might alter its world? From a half-century of exploring our own solar system we've learned a lot about planets and how they work. We know that Mars was once a habitable world with water rushing across its surface. And Venus, a planet that might have been much like Earth, was instead transformed by a runaway greenhouse effect into a hellish world of 800-degree days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By studying these nearby planets, we've discovered general rules for both climate and climate change. These rules, based in physics and chemistry, must apply to any species, anywhere, taking up energy-harvesting and civilization-building in a big way. For example, any species climbing up the technological ladder by harvesting energy through combustion must alter the chemical makeup of its atmosphere to some degree. Combustion always produces chemical byproducts, and those byproducts can't just disappear. As astronomers at Penn State recently discovered, if planetary conditions are right (like the size of a planet's orbit), even relatively small changes in atmospheric chemistry can have significant climate effects. That means that for some civilization-building species, the sustainability crises can hit earlier rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if an intelligent species didn't rely on combustion early in its development, sustainability issues could still arise. All forms of intensive energy-harvesting will have feedbacks, even if some are more powerful than others. A study by scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany, found that extracting energy from wind power on a huge scale can cause its own global climate consequences. When it comes to building world-girdling civilizations, there are no planetary free lunches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This realization motivated me, along with Woodruff Sullivan of the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span>, to look at sustainability in its astrobiological context. As we describe in a recent paper, using what's already known about planets and life, it is now possible to create a broad program for modeling co-evolving ''trajectories'' for technological species and their planets. Depending on initial conditions and choices made by the species (such as the mode of energy harvesting), some trajectories will lead to an unrecoverable sustainability crisis and eventual population collapse. Others, however, may lead to long-lived, sustainable civilizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such research is, however, more than prospecting for scientific curiosities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One answer to the Fermi paradox is that nobody makes it through -- that climate change is fate, that nothing we do today matters because civilization inevitably leads to catastrophic planetary changes. But our models may show that isn't the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By studying sustainability as a generic astrobiological problem, we can understand if the challenge we face will be like threading a needle or crossing a wide valley. Answering this question demands a far deeper understanding of how planets respond to the kind of stresses energy-intensive species (like ours) place on them. It's an approach no different from that of doctors using different kinds of animals, and their molecular biology, to discover cures for human disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this perspective, we also gain an essential truth. We are one form of life, on one planet, in a universe of countless planets. Through hard-won scientific gains, we've begun discovering the patterns and laws governing planets together with the life they host. Ten thousand years from now the Democrats and the Republicans and their squabbles over climate change will be long gone. But the laws of planets and life we're now revealing won't have changed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's fate had been a mystery since Dec. 25, 2003, when it was supposed to land on Mars and start transmitting data back to Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the British-built craft went dark. After several months, it was declared lost -- presumed to have been destroyed during its approach or while trying to land on the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, more than 11 years later, <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> officials reported that the Beagle 2 had been found, thanks to extensive detective work based on new photos taken by the high-resolution camera on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The photos show that Beagle 2 landed safely on Mars and partly deployed -- but was unable to fully deploy and start communicating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it was a vindication of sorts for space scientists who had wondered for more than a decade about the fate of their project, which was designed to search for signs of life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rudolf Schmidt, E.S.A.'s Mars Express project manager at the time, called the finding ''excellent news.'' He said that not knowing what happened to Beagle 2 had ''remained a nagging worry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 2003 disappearance of Beagle 2, American spacecraft have landed on Mars and sent back many pictures and extensive scientific data, providing the sort of information astronomers had been seeking when the first Mars probes began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mars is a notoriously elusive target. The world's overall success rate since the 1960s for Mars missions is less than 50-50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> has attempted the most, 20 launches so far, and has the best success rate: 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia, in second place with 18 Mars launches, has a dismal 14 percent success rate. China collaborated on one of the Russian flops. Europe and Japan have attempted one Martian mission each; the European Mars Express has had mixed results, while the Japanese effort fizzled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said careful analysis of the high-resolution photos showed the Beagle 2 had landed within its expected landing area in a basin close to the Martian equator. Signs of key entry and descent components were also spotted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Identifying the craft was made more difficult by its small size -- it is only about seven feet wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts who helped identify the lander at the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>'s Lunar and Planetary Lab said the photographs are ''consistent'' with only a partial deployment of the Beagle 2 upon landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said a failure to fully deploy would explain why no data or signal from the craft was ever received, since a complete deployment of all of its solar panels would have been needed for successful transmission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfred McEwen, chief investigator of the project, said the special camera had been used to search for all of the landers that have tried to descend to the surface of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This the first time we found one that didn't send a signal after it landed,'' he said. ''If the landing sequence works correctly, the probe sends a radio signal, and you can use that to pinpoint where it is coming from, even if it broadcasts only very briefly. But in the case of Beagle 2, we didn't get anything. All we had to go by was the target landing area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts who worked on the project said the Beagle 2 mission can now be classified a partial success -- even if it never provided information about possible life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United Kingdom Space Agency chief executive, David Parker, said the discovery of the craft showed its complex landing procedures had worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This finding makes the case that Beagle 2 was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in Europe's continuing exploration of Mars,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Beagle 2 was launched on E.S.A.'s Mars Express orbiter. It was released from its mother ship on Dec. 19, 2003, and was supposed to land six days later, but no communications with the lander were ever established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Mark Sims of the <span class="companylink">University of Leicester</span>, who worked on the project, said the new information showed the team came extremely close to its goal of getting data from Mars, with the deployment failing only in its final stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be frank, I had all but given up hope of ever knowing what happened to Beagle 2,'' he said, admitting he was troubled every Christmas Day by the unknown fate of the craft.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- WHEN audiences watch the movie ''Spare Parts'' in theaters this month, they will see the kind of Hollywood ending that has eluded the immigration debate in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film is based on my reporting about four young immigrants who built an underwater robot. In the movie, which closely reflects the true story, the students enter the nation's pre-eminent robotics competition, an event sponsored by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and the Navy. They win widespread recognition for their accomplishments and, when the movie ends in 2004, their future is bright.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, that's not how the story really ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four students were born in Mexico and were brought across the border illegally as children. Though they grew up in Arizona and viewed themselves as Americans, the law did not. They lived with the daily threat of deportation. Oscar Vazquez dreamed of joining the Army -- he was officer of the year in his J.R.O.T.C. program -- but discovered he couldn't enlist because he didn't have legal residency. Cristian Arcega was a geeky brainiac who found few outlets for his smarts in gang-torn West Phoenix. Lorenzo Santillan was a former gang member himself looking to stay clean. And Luis Aranda, the only one who had gotten a work permit, just the year before, was a hulking giant of a kid who rarely spoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ragtag group from Carl Hayden Community High School in West Phoenix constructed the robot out of cheap plastic tubing and garbage. It smelled so bad, they called the machine Stinky. The other entrants -- almost all college students -- had corporate sponsors and serious budgets. This was an underwater robotics contest, but Carl Hayden didn't even have a swimming pool. Nonetheless, Stinky came in first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the event, lower ranked contestants went on to rewarding jobs at tech companies and research institutes. Meanwhile, the Carl Hayden students struggled to afford tuition for college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lorenzo Santillan considered becoming a mechanical engineer, but instead earned a cheaper associate degree in cooking. Today he works as a line cook. Luis Aranda studied cooking as well but did not complete a degree and now works as a janitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cristian Arcega, the most technically skilled member of the team, made it to <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span> on a scholarship. But in 2006, during his freshman year, Arizona voters passed Proposition 300, an anti-immigrant measure that prohibits undocumented students from receiving any state financial aid or qualifying for in-state tuition -- more than tripling his tuition. He dropped out and is now unemployed. He is trying to crowdfund enough money to return to school full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oscar Vazquez's story is the most dramatic. He also had a scholarship to A.S.U., and after working menial jobs for a year, was able to attend. He was a sophomore when Proposition 300 passed, and managed to stay in school only by piecing together more scholarships, all while leading the university's robotics team to regional championships. He graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2009 and applied for legal residency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only was his application denied, but he was also summarily banned from the United States for 10 years for living here without a visa. He ended up working on an assembly line in Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year, his ban was reversed when Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, interceded on his behalf. Mr. Vazquez returned, enlisted in the Army, and served a tour of combat duty in Afghanistan. He is finally a citizen, and repairs trains in Montana for the railroad company BNSF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program created by President Obama's executive order that shields some undocumented students and young adults from deportation, didn't go into effect until 2012. Had it been in place when the Carl Hayden students were in high school, allowing them to legally work, their lives might have turned out very differently. They have surmounted enormous odds, but none were able to professionally pursue their passion for robotics. It is a startling rebuke to the American dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Republicans seem to view this as a fitting outcome. This week, John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, introduced legislation that would roll back the president's order. If he is successful, talented young people like Mr. Santillan and Mr. Arcega could be deported at any moment. ''After a while you get used to disappointment,'' Mr. Arcega said to me this week. ''I try not to have high expectations anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who oppose granting residency to these immigrants argue that it would deny resources to existing residents and citizens. But we've already invested in these students all through elementary and high school. Why not continue and get a return on that investment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is rising demand for the talent these students possess. We grant roughly 85,000 H1B visas, for immigrants with special skills, to engineers to fill jobs here. In doing so, we overlook a generation of students who are deemed foreigners but who grew up here and plan to stay. When their visas expire, a majority of H1B visa holders will leave, and take the skills they developed with them. At a time when science and technology prowess will be critical to this country's growth, we can't afford to squander the homegrown brainpower of students like Oscar, Lorenzo, Luis and Cristian.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wearing protective masks, two astronauts, Terry Virts of <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and Samantha Cristoforetti of the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, opened the hatch that separates the American and Russian segments at 3:05 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Tests of the air showed no signs of ammonia, which is poisonous if inhaled, so the astronauts returned to the American side.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem appeared more likely to have been caused by a faulty computer card than an actual leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alarm had awakened the crew around 4 a.m. Eastern when pressure increased in one of two water loops in the space station's cooling system. The water loops remove heat from the space station. The heat is transferred to loops of ammonia on the outside of the station and radiated into outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A problem with the heat exchanger could cause ammonia to leak into the water loop and then into the American segment of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station consists of two essentially independent segments, one built by Russia, the other by the United States and other nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts put on gas masks, moved into the Russian segment and closed the hatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After sifting through the measurements, the managers at mission control let the astronauts return. But then air pressure in the American segment also started to rise. ''If you're leaking ammonia into the water loop and it eventually finds its way to the cabin, you would expect the cabin pressure to go up,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, the manager of the space station, in an interview on <span class="companylink">NASA</span> Television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew evacuated to the Russian segment a second time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonessential systems were turned off to avoid the possibility of overheating but were later gradually restarted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is looking pretty normal right now,'' James Kelly, an astronaut at mission control, told Barry Wilmore, the station commander, in an update after 8 a.m. Eastern. ''It's a little more positive than we thought before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station crew includes three Russians, Elena Serova, Alexander Samokutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini said none of the science research on the space station had been compromised. Freezers preserving samples and supplies had been briefly turned off, but those are designed to remain cold for more than eight hours even if power is lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were well within that, and all the freezers are back up and running now,'' Mr. Suffredini said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the first stage separated, its engines fired again to turn it around and bring it into a controlled descent. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had tried similar maneuvers on three earlier flights and twice had slowed the 14-story-tall rocket stage to hover over the ocean before it toppled over and broke apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> placed a platform in the ocean. The company also added ''grid fins'' to the side of the rocket to steer it precisely to the 300-foot-by-170-foot platform, about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Fla.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo capsule is scheduled to arrive at the space station on Monday around 6 a.m. The station's robotic arm will then grab onto the capsule and swing it to a docking port.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch had been scheduled for Dec. 19, but was postponed to Jan. 6 after a test firing of the rocket engines was cut short. The Jan. 6 attempt was called off with less than 90 seconds left in the countdown because of a problem with the steering mechanism on the second stage.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a galaxy far, far away, a pair of supermassive black holes appear to be spiraling together toward a cosmic collision of unimaginable scale, astronomers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final act of this mating dance, perhaps a mere million years from now, could release as much energy as 100 million of the violent supernova explosions in which stars end their lives, and wreck the galaxy it is in, said S. George Djorgovski of the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of that energy would go into gravitational waves, the violent ripples of space-time that are predicted but not yet directly detected by Einstein's theory of general relativity, Dr. Djorgovski said. And there could be electromagnetic fireworks as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to theory, he explained in an email, the interactions of the black holes would drive nearby stars away, like shingles in a tornado. ''However,'' he added, ''I think that the nature is never so neat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Djorgovski, one of the authors of a paper published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, will discuss the research at a meeting in Seattle. The lead author is Matthew Graham, a computational scientist at Caltech's Center for Data-Driven Discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The merging black holes manifested as a regular flicker in a quasar -- a mass of light and energy -- in a remote galaxy known as PG 1302-102. The most logical explanation, Dr. Graham and his colleagues wrote, is a pair of black holes circling each other less than a light-year apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the most convincing evidence for a tight pair of black holes with a separation smaller than the solar system,'' said Avi Loeb, a cosmologist at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> who was not involved in the work, noting that other, less convincing systems have been suspected. He cautioned, moreover, that the evidence is not yet airtight; the apparent variation in the quasar light could be a statistical effect from not checking it frequently enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it holds up under scrutiny, the system could be a bonanza for the young field of gravitational wave astronomy. It would also provide a preview of what will happen in our own Milky Way galaxy in a few billion years when it collides with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy, sending the black holes at the hearts of both galaxies into an ''intimate (pre-arranged) companionship,'' as Dr. Loeb put it in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes are the most extreme consequences of Einstein's theory: maws so deep and dense that not even light can escape. There seems to be one weighing as much as millions or even billions of suns squatting like Dante's Lucifer in the center of every galaxy. Normally they are dormant, but when they feed on stars and gas, burping energy into space, they can light up as quasars, beacons that far outshine the galaxies in which they live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mergers of black holes should be common in cosmic history because galaxies are forever merging. Indeed, there are dozens of examples of merging galaxies in which the black holes are separated by tens to thousands of light-years, Dr. Loeb noted, some of them with beautiful jets coming from one or both of the black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers can rarely see the consummation of these relationships, however, because after billions of years circling each other, the last spasm happens, it is believed, in a million years or so -- an unimaginably long time to a human, but unimaginably short to a star or the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flanked by a pair of smaller galaxies, PG 1302-102 lies about 3.5 billion light-years from here in the constellation Virgo, and has a quasar at its center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was spotted in the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, which for nine years has been monitoring the brightness of 247,000 known quasars with telescopes in Arizona and Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Graham found the signal from PG 1302-102 wavered by about 14 percent every 1,884 days, or roughly five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only thing that could so significantly affect a giant black hole, Dr. Djorgovski said, would be another giant black hole. He estimated their combined mass is that of roughly 100 million suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black holes are circling each other at a range of about 180 billion miles, he said. That is far too small to be resolved by any telescopes on Earth, but spectrographic observations suggest there are two things there, the researchers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The light variations could be caused by the jets of energy precessing like tops as the black holes sweep around each other, or perhaps warps in the disks of material swirling around them, Dr. Djorgovski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closeness of the black holes would mean that the system has evolved well past the point where supercomputer simulations of the merger would work. To find out what happens, astronomers will have to build gravitational wave detectors and wait and watch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers announced on Tuesday that they had found eight new planets orbiting their stars at distances compatible with liquid water, bringing the total number of potentially habitable planets in the just-right ''Goldilocks'' zone to a dozen or two, depending on how the habitable zone of a star is defined.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Kepler spacecraft, now in its fifth year of seeking out the shadows of planets circling other stars, has spotted hundreds, and more and more of these other worlds look a lot like Earth -- rocky balls only slightly larger than our own home, that with the right doses of starlight and water could turn out to be veritable gardens of microbial Eden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the ranks of these planets grow, astronomers are planning the next step in the quest to end cosmic loneliness: gauging which hold the greatest promise for life and what tools will be needed to learn about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planets unveiled on Tuesday were detected by a group led by Guillermo Torres of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, another group of astronomers said they had managed to weigh precisely a set of small planets and found that their densities and compositions almost exactly matched those of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courtney Dressing, also of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, said at a news conference, ''I'm going to give you the recipe for a rocky planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She began, ''Take one cup of magnesium ...''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both groups announced their findings at a meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span> in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reviewing the history of exoplanets, Debra Fischer, a Yale astronomer, recalled that the first discovery of a planet orbiting another normal star, a Jupiter-like giant, was 20 years ago. Before that, she said, astronomers worried that ''maybe the 'Star Trek' picture of the universe was not right, and there is no life anywhere else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fischer called the progress in the last two decades ''incredibly moving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet we still do not have a clue that we are not alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Kepler has discovered 4,175 potential planets, and 1,004 of them have been confirmed as real, according to Michele Johnson, a spokeswoman for NASA's Ames Research Center, which operates Kepler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of them, however, including those announced Tuesday, are hundreds of light-years away, too far for detailed study. We will probably never know any more about these particular planets than we do now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can count as many as we like,'' said Sara Seager, a planet theorist at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not involved in the new work, ''but until we can observe the atmospheres and assess their greenhouse gas power, we don't really know what the surface temperatures are like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she added, ''it's heartening to have such a growing list.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding Goldilocks planets closer to home will be the job of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, to be launched in 2017. But if we want to know what the weather is like on these worlds, whether there is water or even life, more powerful instruments will be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Seager is heading a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> study investigating the concept of a starshade, which would float in front of a space telescope and block light from a star so that its much fainter planets would be visible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another group, led by Karl Stapelfeldt of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Goddard Space Flight Center, is studying a method known as a coronagraph, in which the occulting disk is inside the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both studies are expected to be completed in the next few months, and could affect plans for a former spy telescope bequeathed to <span class="companylink">NASA</span> three years ago. Astronomers hope to launch it in the early 2020s to study dark energy, and they plan to include a coronagraph to search for exoplanets, according to Paul Schechter of M.I.T., chairman of a design team. Depending on the probe's orbit, Dr. Seager said, it could also be made ''starshade ready.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s James Webb Space Telescope, due for a 2018 launch, will have a coronagraph capable of seeing Jupiter-size planets, but it is too late to adapt it to a starshade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Dr. Seager and Julianne Dalcanton of the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span> are writing a separate report for a consortium of universities that runs observatories. The goal is to have a pool of dozens of ''exo-Earths'' to study in order to have any chance of seeing signs of life or understanding terrestrial planets, Dr. Seager said. Amassing them will require a space telescope 10 or 12 meters in diameter (the Webb will be 6.5 meters, and the largest currently on Earth is 10).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this will be grist for the mill at the end of the decade when a panel of the National Academy of Sciences produces its wish list for astronomy in the 2020s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of Kepler's bounty, a planet like Earth, of the same size orbiting the same type of star, has not yet been confirmed. The most terrestrial of the new worlds announced Tuesday are a pair known as Kepler 438b and Kepler 442b, both orbiting stars slightly smaller, cooler and redder than our sun. Kepler 438b is only 12 percent larger than Earth in diameter and has a 35-day year; Kepler 442 is a third larger than Earth and has a 112-day year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All these are small, all are potentially habitable,'' said Doug Caldwell of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> Ames at a news conference in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news release, Dr. Torres said, ''Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth.'' That thought was reinforced by his colleagues, led by Ms. Dressing, a doctoral candidate at <span class="companylink">Harvard</span>. Her group combined data from Kepler, which measures the sizes of planets, with spectrographic observations from an Italian telescope in the Canary Islands. That instrument measures planets' masses to determine their densities, and by combining the information Ms. Dressing's group was able to infer the densities and compositions of a set of small planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All five of the planets smaller than 1.6 times the size of Earth fell on a line consistent with Earth and Venus. Planets larger than that, Ms. Dressing and her colleagues found, were fluffier, perhaps because as planets get bigger their mass and gravity increase, and they are better able to hang on to gas and lighter components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work complements and tightens studies done last year by Geoffrey Marcy and his colleagues at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>; that group looks into the nature of so-called super Earths, planets bigger than ours and smaller than Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no planets in this range in our solar system, but according to Kepler they are common in the galaxy. Are they rocks like Earth or blobs like Neptune? The break point now seems to be 1.6 times the size of Earth, according to Ms. Dressing, and it is on those planets, perhaps, that we should concentrate our search for cosmic company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she said in her presentation, ''Doubling the recipe doesn't work.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or as Geoffrey Marcy, an exoplanet explorer and holder of the Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, said not long ago in an email, ''But do they know it's Christmas?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, earthlings were not the only beings in the Milky Way blessed in God's eyes, he elaborated, saying that he liked to tease public audiences with the question. ''Conversations about religion with intelligent beings from an exoplanet might jolt humanity into realizing how parochial our beliefs are,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pope Francis suggested in a homily in May that he would baptize Martians if they landed in St. Peter's Square and asked for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How, you may ask, might E.T. have sinned? On Earth, violence and suffering are embedded in the Darwinian struggle for survival that produced us, says Ted Peters, a professor who runs a group on ''astrotheology'' at the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley. If aliens are made of the same stuff we are, Dr. Peters wrote in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 2011, ''might they also share the ambiguity between good and evil that we are familiar with?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if they are computers or other forms of artificial intelligence that futurists say might ultimately supplant us as masters of the universe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian scholars like Dr. Peters and indeed the pope agree that the possibility of redemption probably extends to all of creation, even perhaps the inanimate world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How could he be God and leave extraterrestrials in sin?'' asks the Rev. George V. Coyne, the former director of the Vatican Observatory and now a Jesuit priest who holds the McDevitt Chair of Religious Philosophy at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, in the 2000 book ''Many Worlds: The New Universe, Extraterrestrial Life and the Theological Implications,'' edited by the astronomer Steven J. Dick, a former chief historian for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>. ''After all, he was good to us. Why should he not be good to them?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has engendered a sort of how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin argument about whether Christ died for the entire cosmos, or whether the son of God or the metaphysical equivalent has to be born and die on every populated planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each alternative sounds ridiculous on the face of it. The first alternative would make Earth the center of the universe again, not just in space but in time, carrying the hopes for the salvation of beings that lived and died millions or billions of years ago and far, far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second alternative would be multiple incarnations, requiring every civilization to have its own redeemer -- ''its own adventure with God,'' in the words of Professor Peters. That is hardly better. As the old troublemaker Thomas Paine wrote in ''The Age of Reason,'' ''In this case, the person who is irreverently called the son of God, and sometimes God himself, would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of deaths, with scarcely a momentary interval of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distinguished theologians have come down on different sides of this issue; after all, it's not up to us to say what God could or could not do. ''God doesn't seem to be limited by history and communication,'' Dr. Peters said in an interview, playing the devil's advocate, so to speak, for the notion of a single incarnation for the entire cosmos. In that case, the consequences would not be limited to ''people who get emails about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every sentient being is blessed by God's grace whether they know about it or not,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking scientific as well as spiritual guidance, I dialed up Guy Consolmagno at the Vatican Observatory. He is a Jesuit brother and a co-author, with his fellow Jesuit Paul Mueller, of ''Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial? ... And Other Questions from the Astronomer's In-box at the Vatican Observatory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brother Consolmagno spent 10 years working and teaching as a planetary scientist, specializing in meteorites, before joining the Jesuits. Last year, he was awarded the Carl Sagan Medal by the Division for Planetary Sciences of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>, for communication in planetary science. He said that Christmas for aliens could be a wonderful story, but that he didn't have any answers and that that was part of the fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One incarnation seems absurd but not inconsistent with the data,'' he said by phone from Florida, where he was watching manatees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no data, I pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Exactly!'' he responded, laughing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to popular perception, he said, religion, like science, is not a closed book. ''Science,'' he said, ''is stuff we understand about truths we only partially grasp. Religion is trying to get closer to truths we don't understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more you know, the more you know you don't understand, he said. ''That's called progress.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge in any person's or species' life, he added, is how to learn others' truths without giving up your own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy, with tongue fairly firmly in cheek, evoked what he called ''the multigod model of the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There might be room in the universe for more than one truth, he said, if every inhabited planet had its own gods. The inhabitants might be as certain of their beliefs as we humans are of ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The deities have carved out their operating galactic territories, like so many cosmic Corleone families,'' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only with SETI research,'' he went on, referring to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, ''will we learn whether our particular God is alone in the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His point was echoed, if less ironically, by Nancy Ellen Abrams, a lawyer, philosopher and author of a forthcoming book, ''A God That Could Be Real: Spirituality, Science and the Future of Our Planet,'' which argues that God is an emergent phenomenon, a result of the complexity of the universe and human aspirations rather than the cause of them -- although no less real for that. ''Our god is the god of humanity; it has nothing to do with aliens,'' she said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the best of all possible universes, all these truths and gods would mysteriously and perhaps revelatorily overlap. But maybe that is wishful thinking and there is another, more chilling answer to Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take that star in the East; it was the subject of a classic story by Arthur C. Clarke, a science fiction author and space visionary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''The Star,'' published in 1955, an expedition to the site of an old supernova explosion discovers the remains of an ancient civilization, carefully preserved because its members knew they were about to be obliterated. The story is told through the eyes of the astrophysicist onboard, a Jesuit. He is able to figure out exactly when the explosion that doomed this race took place, and exactly what it would have looked like 2,000 years ago from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There can be no reasonable doubt,'' he concludes, ''the ancient mystery is solved at last. Yet, oh God, there were so many stars you could have used. What was the need to give these people to the fire, that the symbol of their passing might shine above Bethlehem?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brother Consolmagno, who was a science fiction aficionado as an undergraduate at M.I.T., knows the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's not the kind of god I'm happy with,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 29, 2014, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Out There column on Tuesday, about whether earthly notions of spirituality might extend to life beyond our planet, misstated the religious vocation of Guy Consolmagno, a planetary scientist with the Vatican Observatory. He is a Jesuit brother, not a Jesuit priest.</p>
