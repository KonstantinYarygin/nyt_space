<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 30 -- The space shuttle Discovery and its seven astronauts are to roar into orbit on Saturday afternoon on what NASA managers called ''a rather pedestrian mission'' that nevertheless has a great deal riding on it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liftoff is scheduled for 3:49, when Earth's rotation will put the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center here in the orbital plane of the International Space Station, the shuttle's destination.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's biggest concern is the weather, with a 60 percent probability of thunderstorms that would force a postponement of at least a day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day mission is mainly dedicated mainly to carrying food, water, spare parts, oxygen and other supplies to the International Space Station, along with a new crew member, Thomas Reiter of Germany, who will be the first astronaut from the European Space Agency to serve on the orbiting laboratory for a long term.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But far more important to the future of the space program is the issue of flaws that doomed two previous missions, those of the Challenger in 1986 and the Columbia in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is only the second flight since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven, caused by a 1.67-pound piece of foam that fell from the shuttle's giant external fuel tank during ascent and punched a lethal hole in its left wing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA spent two years redesigning the tank and developed potential repair methods. But shortly after the Discovery's liftoff in its return-to-flight mission a year ago, several smaller but still hazardous pieces of foam fell from the tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew S. W. Thomas, an astronaut aboard that flight, recalled in an interview on Friday that as it circled the Earth, ''there were people saying, 'We're the last shuttle flight.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, Saturday's launching will be closely monitored by batteries of cameras both at the space center and at other locations along the flight path.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also an escape plan if damage is detected during the flight. The shuttle would dock at the orbiting space station and the astronauts would move into it for weeks or months until a rescue mission by a second shuttle could be launched.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combined crew of nine would have to live under relatively cramped conditions in 1,800 square feet of habitable space. (The average new American home is more than 2,400 square feet.) Michael T. Suffredini, the manager for the International Space Station, said that under this ''safe haven'' plan, the space station was well stocked with the food, water and oxygen that the combined crew would need, with ''quite a bit of margin.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA would then be faced with the unhappy prospect of flying another shuttle with the same design flaws that caused the damage on the Discovery flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of the concerns about falling foam, however, many officials and astronauts say the biggest worries are the oldest ones, most prominently the shuttle's main engines and solid rocket boosters during the crucial, bone-rattling eight and a half minutes of flight before the main engines cut off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flying the shuttle is not without risk for many reasons way beyond foam,'' NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said Friday at a preflight news conference, ''and in fact, I worry that we spend so much time worrying about foam that we won't worry about other things that could get us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three main engines burn more than 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen that is pumped in from the external tank. And while they can at least be turned off if something goes wrong, the two solid rocket boosters flanking the huge fuel tank burn until their propellant is used up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial ascent is ''a controlled explosion,'' said Mike Mullane, a former astronaut, and ''the most terrifying part of the flight.'' By comparison, foam damage is a problem that affects re-entry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I was aboard that rocket,'' he added, ''I wouldn't be thinking at all about re-entry.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A storm on Saturday afternoon, in the 10-minute time window when the launching pad is in alignment with the space station, would force a postponement because of the potential for other kinds of damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the enormous speeds of launching, raindrops become bullets that can damage the shuttle's skin. NASA will not launch if there is rain on the launching pad or in the flight path, if lightning has been detected within 11.5 miles of the pad, or if winds are more than about 34 miles per hour. High anvil-shaped thunderclouds that are likely to produce lightning must be at least 20 miles away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If weather or a last-minute technical problem causes the space agency to put off the flight on Saturday, a second attempt will take place on Sunday. If the weather proves uncooperative on Sunday -- and right now the weather for Sunday looks much like the weather for Saturday, with the same 60 percent chance of a scrub -- then NASA will probably stand down until Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If problems persist, or if a new issue emerges that requires more study and repair, the current launching window will last until July 19, with the next opportunities coming between Aug. 28 and Sept. 14.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In NASA's preflight review this month, some leading engineers argued against launching the current mission until areas of the fuel tank that still shed small amounts of foam could be redesigned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Griffin, the head of the space agency, overruled the engineers, saying he did not agree with their assertion that a foam incident was ''probable'' over the life of the program and that the result would be ''catastrophic.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that the risk was to the vehicle and not the crew, who could wait aboard the space station for rescue if the shuttle was damaged during ascent, and that he wanted to leave time to complete the 17 missions planned before President Bush's deadline for ending the shuttle program in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Mr. Griffin defended that decision, contrasting the open discussion with the process that led up to the Columbia disaster, in which managers were found to have squelched dissent. This month's preflight review was a healthy exchange of ideas and decision-making about difficult issues, he said, adding, ''What you're seeing is a good process.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think sometimes people mistake the desire to hear all of the opinions with the ability to agree with all of the opinions,'' he said. ''Agreement is not offered. What is offered is a willingness and a desire to hear, and an obligation to speak.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Columbia disaster, NASA was widely accused of letting scheduling pressures override safety concerns. But Mr. Griffin said schedules could not be ignored.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This may be politically incorrect,'' he said, ''but there are no activities that humans undertake that don't have a schedule associated with them. It matters if you finish a job this year or in the next decade.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying to work in 17 flights before 2010, he said, was ''a schedule we can meet, but we need to get on with things.'' And he added:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do not think -- I absolutely do not think and do not accept -- that we are being unduly influenced by schedule pressure. But we pay attention to schedule because time is money, and that matters.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery is to be launched this afternoon on the first mission since last July, when pieces of foam fell from the external fuel tank during ascent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2005 mission, the PAL ramps -- intended to protect cables and lines near the solid rocket boosters -- were removed. That made it necessary to add extensions to ice/frost ramps, which protect the brackets holding the cables and lines to the tank.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system, which could be used if astronauts were forced to abandon the shuttle and take refuge in the International Space Station, makes use of a 28-foot-long braided cable, weighing about five pounds, that can be attached to various control boxes on the shuttle. It would allow flight controllers on the ground to activate systems that previously had to be switched on by members of the shuttle crew, including power units, landing gear and drag chutes.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, the deputy manager of the space shuttle program, described the automatic landing system at a news briefing in preparation for the launching of the shuttle Discovery as early as Saturday. The flight will be only the second since the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven astronauts in 2003, because a piece of falling foam put a hole in the left wing during ascent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA spent two years redesigning the external fuel tank and developed potential repair methods. But in the flight of the shuttle Discovery last year, several pieces of foam fell from the tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly announced cable system could offer an alternative to ditching a craft worth at least $2 billion. If the craft had a chance of successful re-entry but officials felt that the risk to crew might be unacceptably high, the cable could be tried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing might be tried at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California so the approach to Earth would occur over water.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan was developed over the past year, said Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman. In the past NASA officials have argued that it would be impossible to land the shuttle without astronauts. Before the cable was developed, Mr. Herring said, the ability to feed landing instructions to the computers was there, but ''the ability to land safely was not.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With dogged determination, NASA will try resuming regular space shuttle missions this week, hoping that the venerable spacecraft will weather aging components and falling debris long enough to finish construction of the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched as early as Saturday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on just the second flight since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven. Officials hope to test the modifications and new procedures instituted after the disaster.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration flew its first test flight after the disaster almost a year ago, and the second was to follow just weeks later. But a problem with shedding foam persisted, even after the space agency spent more than a year and hundreds of millions of dollars to correct it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia disintegrated while returning from a research mission on Feb. 1, 2003, after being critically damaged at liftoff when a piece of foam weighing 1.67 pounds broke from its external fuel tank and struck its left wing. That opened a crack that admitted superheated gases when the craft re-entered earth's atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the highly modified Discovery flew last year, much less foam debris fell. But the tank still shed several unacceptably large pieces, weighing up to a pound, that could have done severe damage. NASA grounded the fleet and removed 35 more pounds of foam from critical areas. This month, mission managers pronounced the Discovery ready to fly again, even though some engineers argued that more needed to be done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defending the decision, NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said that falling foam might pose a danger to the shuttle but not to the crew, because the astronauts could find a haven, if necessary, on the orbiting space station; another shuttle could then be sent to retrieve them. (Mr. Griffin did add, however, that another serious accident could end the shuttle program.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle fleet is scheduled to fly 16 more missions to complete work on the half-finished space station and possibly to service the Hubble Space Telescope. The three remaining shuttles -- Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour -- are scheduled to be retired in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're going to fly, we need to accept some programmatic risks -- not crew risks -- and get on with it,'' Dr. Griffin said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's crew members, experienced astronauts and rookies alike, say they are eager to get under way. ''The crew is ready, we're ready,'' said the mission commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, who has flown three previous missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goals of the 12-day flight are to test the post-Columbia modifications and procedures, perform maintenance on the space station and deliver critical supplies, and deliver a new crew member to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the Columbia disaster, the space station had three astronauts. Without regular shuttle visits, the station had provisions for only two. But now Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut with the European Space Agency, will join Pavel Vinogradov of Russia and Jeffrey Williams of the United States, who are about halfway through their 180-day stay. Station managers said the additional crewman would allow the astronauts to move beyond maintaining the research outpost to performing more science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To inspect for possible in-flight damage to the Discovery, NASA has mounted additional cameras on the shuttle since the last mission; every aspect of liftoff will be examined for possible problems. Video cameras at the top of each rocket booster look down on the fuel tank, and new ones on the bottom look up. One on the tank looks at the shuttle's belly, and a digital camera will take photographs of the fuel tank after it drops away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expanded observations of the flight will also take place on the ground. More than 100 cameras and radar devices at 25 widely scattered sites will make high-definition images of the shuttle from numerous angles. As with the previous launching, this one will be done in daylight so the fuel tank can be easily photographed as it drops into the ocean thousands of miles from Cape Canaveral.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspection will continue as the shuttle heads to the space station. Astronauts will extend a 50-foot, Canadian-built robot arm that has a 50-foot boom with a camera and a laser imager. The crew will spend seven hours moving the boom along critical parts of the shuttle's heat-protection system looking for potential problems areas, and will relay the data to the ground for closer examination.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon approaching the space station, Colonel Lindsey will stop the Discovery about 600 feet away and execute a tricky maneuver that should take about eight minutes. He will rotate the 100-ton orbiter nose-up in a full circle, allowing the station crew to take detailed photographs of the shuttle. Once done, Colonel Lindsey and the Discovery's pilot, Mark E. Kelly, a Navy commander who flew on one earlier mission, will dock the shuttle to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two spacecraft will be attached for about a week, during which time the Discovery will unload tons of supplies and new equipment carried in an Italian-made module called Leonardo. The cargo transfer will be supervised by Stephanie D. Wilson, a first-time astronaut, who will also use the station's robot arm to move Leonardo from the shuttle's cargo bay to the station and back again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two spacewalks are planned during the mission, with a third possible if controllers determine that the Discovery has enough power and oxygen for an extra day at the station. Piers J. Sellers, a veteran of a previous flight and three spacewalks, and Michael E. Fossum, on his first mission, will venture outside to repair a mini-railcar system that transports equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair will also attach a work platform to the end of the shuttle's robot arm and extension boom to see if it can serve as a stable platform that would allow astronauts to reach previously inaccessible parts of the shuttle to repair damage. The Discovery's flight engineer, Cmdr. Lisa M. Nowak of the Navy, who is on her first mission, will operate the robot arm during the spacewalks. If a third walk is possible, the astronauts will tests methods that could be used to repair damage to the heat shields on the shuttle's wing and nose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mission is successful, N. Wayne Hale Jr., the chief of the shuttle program, said NASA could launch the Atlantis as early as Aug. 28 to resume construction of the space station.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is NASA slipping back into the same old bad habits that yielded two disastrous space shuttle accidents in the past? That question is inevitably raised by the agency's troubling rationale for launching the shuttle Discovery in early July despite objections from the agency's top safety officer and chief engineer, both of whom urged a delay to make further design changes lest the vehicle be lost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to proceed with the launch anyway -- made by Michael Griffin, the administrator of NASA -- was a gutsy call. It even seems reasonable, if you accept the constraints he was operating under. But if you believe, as we do, that the benefits to be gained from further shuttle flights are minimal, this looks like an unnecessary risk to the spacecraft and to the astronauts who will be riding in it.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no one is saying so publicly, this decision was primarily driven by diplomatic and budgetary considerations. The Bush administration, which has no qualms about flouting allies in other areas, has decided that it must honor commitments to our 15 international partners to complete the space station that is now circling half-finished overhead. Some 16 more shuttle flights will be needed to carry large components that cannot be lifted any other way. The administration has also decided to retire the aging shuttles for good in 2010, primarily to free up substantial sums to pursue the president's grandiose but underfinanced plan to explore the Moon and Mars in coming decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given those two imperatives, Mr. Griffin concluded that it would be better to take a little risk now and send the long-grounded shuttles back into space than to delay even longer and then try to cram all 16 flights into future years. This sounds suspiciously as though Mr. Griffin has fallen into the old trap of sacrificing safety to meet his launching schedule -- precisely the kind of trade-off that has been blamed for the loss of two shuttles in the past. Mr. Griffin contends that launching now will reduce future schedule pressures, but that seems a lame rationale for a mission that will be the first ever classified as an ''unacceptable risk'' by the agency's engineering analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The red flag involves insulating foam. When 25 top managers were polled at a recent flight readiness review, NASA's lead safety officer and its chief engineer both recommended against flying until design changes were made to reduce the risk that foam would break off from the external fuel tank and hit the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, the shuttle Columbia was destroyed by just such an event. Ever since, NASA has been struggling, with only limited success, to eliminate the foam-shedding problem. It removed the area of foam on the fuel tank that had felled the Columbia, but on a gingerly flight by Discovery last summer a dangerous chunk broke loose from another area. Much additional foam was removed, but engineers remain concerned about foam that covers the so-called ice-frost ramps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's crew members -- some of whom have been waiting a decade for their chance to fly -- voiced unanimous support for launching now. And in the end the two dissenting NASA experts acquiesced in the decision to launch because there are ways to rescue the astronauts from danger. Even if debris punches a hole in the shuttle's skin, it should be possible to detect any damage to the heat shield before the astronauts try to return to earth. That would allow time to try a rudimentary repair in orbit or to transfer the astronauts to the space station to await rescue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials gloss over how risky a rescue attempt would be. Although another shuttle will be ready to retrieve the astronauts, it would be vulnerable to the same foam shedding as the Discovery. Russian spacecraft, though sturdy, can accommodate fewer passengers, stretching out any rescue attempt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin and his top managers dispute the idea that an accident is ''probable'' -- one called the likelihood ''extremely remote'' -- mostly because of the shuttle's past history. Although lots of small pieces of foam have fallen off the ice-frost ramps in previous flights, they say, none have caused significant damage. That sounds eerily like NASA's attitude back in the 1980's when it reasoned that leaks in the O-ring seals of the shuttle's booster rockets were tolerable because they had never damaged a shuttle -- until, of course, they destroyed the Challenger during ascent in 1986.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are safer options that could be pursued if higher officials in the administration were willing. The 2010 date for retiring the shuttles could be extended slightly, allowing time to resolve the foam problem and then get in all 16 flights. Or 2010 could be held firm and the number of shuttle flights reduced, yielding a smaller space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any delays inevitably increase the chances that the shuttle program will be terminated before the space station is completed. That would not be a national disaster, in our judgment. The aging shuttles are a diminishing asset, required primarily to finish the space station, which is itself of only marginal scientific value. That makes it doubly sad that Mr. Griffin feels constrained to launch a flawed vehicle to complete a job that is barely worth doing.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan O'Connor, NASA's lead safety official, and Christopher Scolese, its chief engineer, voted ''no go'' on Saturday when agency officials meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida cleared Discovery for a planned July 1 liftoff.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other officials acknowledged that it was somewhat unusual to certify a shuttle to fly without complete concurrence by the top managers. But they said that everyone's concerns had been vetted in an intensive, nonconfrontational exchange during two days of meetings and that a decision was made to go ahead with the flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to inquiries from reporters, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Scolese on Wednesday answered questions about their dissenting opinions in a telephone news conference and both said their concerns were not about the safety of Discovery's seven-member crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two officials said they were concerned that the insulating foam that covers 34 metal brackets on the shuttle's external fuel tank might dislodge during the launching and damage the spacecraft's protective heat shield beyond repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though such damage would not endanger the crew, which could stay in a ''safe haven'' aboard the International Space Station until rescued by another shuttle, the officials said they were concerned about losing an irreplaceable shuttle like Discovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My no-go was based on loss of vehicle risk,'' Mr. O'Connor said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials said they signed off on proceeding with the flight, only the second since the loss of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003, but wanted to note their objections about proceeding without fully resolving the foam debris issue. Engineers have redesigned the fuel tank and removed most sources of large pieces of potentially damaging debris, leaving remaining foam over the brackets as a leading source of damage, shuttle officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the Columbia accident. Foam insulation falling from the tank during the launching damaged the shuttle's heat shield, causing the destruction of the craft and the death of the crew when the shuttle tried to return through the atmosphere from a mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Discovery flew last July on the first mission since Columbia, a greatly reduced but still hazardous amount of foam fell from its tank, resulting in further foam reduction since then.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 17 -- After what they called a ''spirited discussion,'' NASA officials decided Saturday to launch the space shuttle Discovery as planned on July 1. It will be only the second flight since the Columbia tragedy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concluding a two-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida that Michael D. Griffin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said involved ''intensive and spirited exchange'' over safety issues, shuttle authorities gave a go-ahead to the flight despite the reservations of two senior officials.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin told a televised news conference from Kennedy that he approved the 13-day flight because he did not feel it presented an undue risk to the seven-member crew, even though issues remained about debris from the shuttle's external fuel tank that could damage the vehicle during launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said Bryan O'Conner, the agency's lead safety official, and Christopher Scolese, its chief engineer, eventually signed off on the flight plans, but noted their objections about proceeding without fully resolving the debris issue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said NASA gets lots of advice and seriously considers it all. However, he said, when there is not unanimous agreement, he has to make a decision, state his rationale for it, and proceed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were very different viewpoints on the issue of whether we were ready to fly or not,'' he said. ''I can't possibly accept every recommendation given to me by every member of my staff, especially when they all don't agree.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern centers on pieces of insulating foam that cover 34 brackets on the tank that secure pipes and wiring. These so-called ice-frost ramps prevent the buildup of ice, another form of hazardous debris that could fall off during launching and damage the shuttle's heat shield. The ramps are being redesigned to reduce their size and hazard potential, but any changes cannot be adapted until at least next spring, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said the largest falling foam hazards had been eliminated from the fuel tank, and although the ice-frost ramps remained a high-risk problem, flight experience suggested they could remain unchanged for a few flights without significantly increasing their chances of causing crucial damage to a shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the loss of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003. Foam insulation falling from the tank during launching damaged Columbia's heat shield, causing the destruction of the craft and the deaths of seven astronauts as the ship tried to return through the atmosphere from a mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars redesigning the tank to reduce foam shedding. However, when Discovery flew last July on the first mission since Columbia, a greatly reduced but hazardous amount of foam still fell from its redesigned tank, including a large, potentially damaging piece.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA grounded the fleet, and tank engineers removed more than 37 pounds of foam that formed two air deflectors that protected pressurized fuel lines and cables down the side of the tank, places from which the biggest pieces of foam fell during the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said he wanted shuttles flying soon to get in 16 or 17 missions to finish construction of the International Space Station and service the Hubble Space Telescope before the orbiters are retired in 2010. Delays, he said, will add pressure to rush flights to stay on schedule, which increases safety risks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a shuttle is critically damaged during launching, Mr. Griffin said, the crew could make it to the space station to await rescue by another shuttle or a Russian spacecraft. Such an accident would not unduly threaten crew safety, he said, but it probably would end the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would be moving to shut the program down,'' Mr. Griffin said of the loss of another shuttle. ''I think, at that point, we're done.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have accomplished more than their creators thought possible. Stoic, plodding and reliable, they have muscled across the planet's rugged terrain for more than two years, collecting data about the composition of its rocks and soils in the process.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most dogged workhorses, however, have limitations. In their entire time on the planet, the slow-moving rovers have traversed less than 10 square miles, and their sensors cannot collect data more than a few feet above the ground.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To survey areas of the planet that remain unknown, researchers affiliated with the privately financed German Mars Society in Munich are proposing a different kind of explorer: a vehicle inspired more by dirigibles like the Hindenburg than by land-rover predecessors. Projected to reach Mars in 2009, the balloon craft, named Archimedes, would hover much closer to the planet's surface than a satellite, snapping crisp, full-color images similar to those that an Earth photographer might take from a helicopter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an hourlong descent to the ground, the balloon craft would use an array of sensors to take temperature, wind and humidity readings. These data, collected at a variety of altitudes, would provide the raw material scientists need to understand Martian weather patterns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A rover can't tell you the atmospheric density several miles above Mars's surface, and it can't give you an image of the planet's surface taken from a mile up,'' said Bernd Hausler, a project scientist. ''A balloon craft can do both of those things.'' A suite of magnetic sensors could also record gravity fluctuations that provide clues about weight distribution inside the planet, lending insight into its geological makeup.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balloon craft was the brainchild of Hannes Griebel. In 2002, as an advanced engineering student at the Technical University of Munich, Mr. Griebel was looking for a Mars project that would not retread ground that rover missions planned to cover. ''There's so much about Mars we don't know,'' he said. ''I started to think, 'What are the data we haven't been able to get?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A helium-filled balloon craft, he reasoned, could obtain a more comprehensive profile of the planet's surface and atmosphere than any other vehicle. Best of all, the project would be cheap enough -- under $2 million -- that he could pursue it with money from private donors instead of depending on government financing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hausler, head of the Institute for Spaceflight Technology at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Munich, was initially skeptical when Mr. Griebel approached him with the plan. ''Hannes was proposing this crazy idea that we try to put a balloon into Mars's atmosphere,'' he said. Still, seeing the project's potential, he decided to offer Dr. Griebel a faculty position instead of turning him away. ''I told him, 'Let's attack this.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With money from the German Mars Society, whose members -- mostly scientists -- had expressed interest in a balloon project for years, the two were off and running. However, they quickly found themselves up against a host of technical challenges. ''The balloon itself is no problem; we already have weather balloons that ferry you through the stratosphere, which has conditions very similar to Mars's atmosphere,'' Dr. Griebel said. ''Getting it into the atmosphere is the difficult part.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Mr. Griebel envisioned a balloon that would inflate once its launch vehicle had entered the atmosphere. But in Mars's thin carbon dioxide surroundings, ''there isn't much to slow the craft down as it falls, so you need to inflate something big in a very short time,'' he said. Achieving this feat would require a complicated and expensive ground-based control system, so he scrapped the idea in favor of inflating the balloon in deep space and then propelling the buoyant orb into the Martian atmosphere. That option presented its own problems. As a spacecraft reaches the threshold between the vacuum of space and a planet's outer atmosphere, large amounts of friction turn the energy its orbital motion has generated into heat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a little over 170 pounds, the craft would generate less than a quarter of the friction that a space shuttle might, but its filmy surface would still heat up to about 620 degrees Fahrenheit during atmospheric entry. The project team plans to coat the 33-foot-wide balloon with a heat-tolerant polymer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making sure the inflation mechanism would work in a zero-gravity environment also proved daunting. If pockets of gas became trapped in the folded balloon's plastic crevices, they would expand rapidly in the vacuum of space, possibly jamming the delicate mechanical components that position the balloon for inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team scheduled a test flight last spring on the Zero-G Airbus A300 of the French company Novespace. The plane flies in an up-and-down pattern that makes objects in the cabin weightless for seconds at a time. Project scientists deployed the balloon more than 80 times during these weightless moments, and it inflated as expected about 90 percent of the time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the researchers sent the craft into true zero gravity, strapping the balloon and a camera-containing module to a sounding rocket that went more than 60 miles above Earth's surface. Although a few grainy images that cameras transmitted to Earth showed that the balloon inflated properly upon reaching deep space, the remainder of the test was a comedy of errors. The rocket collided with the recently detached camera module, preventing it from acquiring planned high-resolution footage of the craft. Another trial is planned for October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What chance of success does the craft have, given the difficulties of deploying a balloon in space and the lack of financing from conventional space programs? The mission participants have no illusions, describing the project as a high-stakes gamble. ''The deployment system could fail, or the balloon could burst once it's inflated,'' Dr. Griebel said. ''There are all kinds of things that could go wrong.'' In addition, to cut costs the craft will travel to Mars on a satellite owned by the private Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (Amsat), which will be launched from Germany in 2009 aboard an Ariane-5 rocket. If the rocket experiences technical problems, they will be beyond the control of the project team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft also faces competition from better-bankrolled Mars balloon projects, though these programs' projected launch dates are much further in the future. With financing from the Institute for Advanced Concepts at NASA, the Global Aerospace Corporation in Altadena, Calif., is developing a balloon craft for an image-gathering mission that would last up to a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the German craft, which has no steering mechanism -- prevailing winds and its own orbital velocity will speed it along -- Global Aerospace's craft will feature a rudderlike sail to allow for limited maneuverability, said Alexey Pankine, a project scientist at Global Aerospace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pioneer Astronautics in Lakewood, Colo., is working on a balloon-based Mars craft, though no new tests have been reported since a prototype was launched into the stratosphere six years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Zubrin, an aerospace engineer and the author of ''The Case for Mars,'' thinks the German craft has the best immediate promise of the Mars balloon projects in the works. Dr. Zubrin sees the craft as a trailblazer for more elaborate, longer-lived future balloons, much as NASA's 1997 Sojourner rover paved the way for Spirit and Opportunity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scientists involved are taking this extremely seriously; they're putting the craft through the kind of rigorous testing that's needed,'' he said. If the German team succeeds, he added, it will mark a cultural as well as a scientific milestone, illustrating the extent to which private citizens can chart the course of space exploration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to providing unique image and climate data, Dr. Pankine thinks the German craft could aid the cause of astrobiology. ''The magnetic field readings they're taking will tell us more about Mars's geological history, and the more we know about what originally shaped the surface, the more we can figure out whether conditions existed to create life,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zubrin said the greatest potential of the German craft lay not in turning up unexpected findings, but in adding detail and breadth to public conceptions of Mars. ''Right now, the image of Mars most people have is either a small dot in the sky or an expanse of terrain a few miles wide,'' he said. ''With this mission, we'll get the big picture. We'll finally start to see Mars as an entire world in itself.''   </p>

''If people visualize data, they tend to understand it, whether you are talking about 600 million years of continental drift or seeing an entire hurricane season projected in three minutes. This is a lot of information, but people get it if they can see it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science on a Sphere takes flat, two-dimensional images and data taken from spherical objects like planets and moons, and synchronizes and blends them into animated presentations. Most of the almost 100 presentations created so far are silent displays meant to illustrate lectures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Starobin and his group at Goddard are trying to change this approach by producing the first true movie for the system, a 16-minute presentation called ''Footprints.'' (Data scanned by a passing satellite is sometimes called a footprint.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than four months, the group combined remote sensing data and other visuals with graphics, text, computer-generated images, music and narration to depict the dynamic Earth, with guest appearances by the Moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a way to depict the natural world in a new way,'' Mr. Starobin said. ''Using the sphere gives us another way of seeing things.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producing this type of program is not easy, he said, because the sphere distorts things like text and the images of people and common objects. ''We had to be creative, but we developed a set of tools that should make it easier the next time,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presentation is being distributed free to places operating sphere systems, among them science museums and centers in Seattle, Baltimore, St. Paul, Honolulu and San Jose, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. MacDonald said the installation cost about $180,000, which he called a reasonable investment for a major exhibit at a science center. He said his group was working on a next-generation system that would display images in higher resolution. It will also add a fifth projector for the bottom of the globe, which hovers about three feet above the floor and is now largely unseen and unused.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea has come a long way since it came to Dr. MacDonald in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was driving down a road and the thought came to me: Why don't people display things on spheres?'' he said. ''When I got home, I painted a beach ball white and projected pictures on the ball.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked pretty good, and I thought this would be a great way to explain science to people.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Science Times on Tuesday about an explanation by astronomers of a spectacular eruption in the Milky Way in 2002 misstated the name of the constellation where it took place. It is Monoceros. (V838 Monocerotis is the star that exploded.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Jun 09 2006   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this a picture of a star that just swallowed its own planets? Talk about bad mothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what astronomers have been arguing about for the last three years, ever since Alon Retter and Ariel Marom, then of the University of Sydney in Australia, proposed infanticide as the explanation for a spectacular and unusual outburst in the constellation Monocerotis, just east of Orion in the sky. In January 2002, a star there by the typically ungainly name of V838 Monocerotis erupted, brightening to become 600,000 times as luminous as the Sun and swelling to a billion miles across, about the orbit of Jupiter, to become one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy, as well as one of the coolest.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pulse of light traveling outward from the explosion has illuminated shells of dust previously kicked off the star, visible as a movie at nytimes.com/space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Retter's and Dr. Marom's measurements of the star's light output showed that the explosion happened in three stages, reaching a peak in brightness and then declining three times from January to March 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, they said, could be the signature of three Jupiter-size planets going to their doom. As the star began to puff up at the end of its life into a so-called red giant, the story goes, it enveloped its progeny, each of which then dropped deep into the star with a boom, increasing the expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other astronomers have questioned whether the planets would fall far or fast enough to produce the required energy. Noam Soker of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Romuald Tylenda of the Copernicus Astronomical Center in Torun, Poland, argued that a small star falling in would be required to produce the observed energy. Other theories include the merger of two stars, a thermonuclear convulsion on the dense core of a red giant, and the most popular -- none of the above.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Dr. Retter, of Pennsylvania State University, reported new calculations by himself and three colleagues, in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that he said bolstered their controversial notion and a new variant, in which the outburst could have been fueled by one giant planet falling in three stages, like a basketball bouncing down the stairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Personally, I like the three-planets scenario,'' Dr. Retter wrote in an e-mail message, ''but there a few advantages for the single planet model.'' Howard E. Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute, who has taken movies of the Monocerotis eruption with the Hubble Space Telescope, said no theory of the explosion was convincing yet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe it to be one of the major unsolved problems in stellar astrophysics,'' Dr. Bond said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer could be relevant to our own plight. Someday a few billion years from now, the Sun will run out of fuel and also become a red giant, swallowing Mercury and frying the Earth and Venus. DENNIS OVERBYE  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 31 -- Although there is still a risk of dangerous foam debris, NASA officials cleared the space shuttle's external fuel tank on Wednesday for launching of the Discovery in July, after a year on the ground.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle program officials, meeting at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, said enough modifications had been made on the tank since the last shuttle flight to give them confidence that the foam risk was minor.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., manager of the shuttle program, said at a news conference that foam debris from different areas on the fuel tank would continue to come off and pose some risk of damaging a shuttle. But he called the risk ''acceptable'' and said, ''We have eliminated the largest hazards.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeating a note often sounded by NASA officials and astronauts, Mr. Hale said the shuttle would always be risky to fly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director at Kennedy, said the Discovery should be ready to launch within a window lasting from July 1 through July 19. In the approach to that window, managers will have unusually long contingency time, almost two weeks, to deal with problems that might arise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach also said the shuttle Atlantis was on schedule to roll out to its launching pad on July 25 in anticipation of a mission beginning Aug. 28 or shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA wants to fly the shuttle three times before the end of the year to get back on schedule building the International Space Station before the shuttle fleet's retirement in 2010. After 2006, officials hope to fly four missions a year before the deadline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reduction in falling fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the loss of the shuttle Columbia, a disaster that was caused by foam insulation that tore from the tank at launching and punched a hole in a heat shield. Superheated gases entered the hole as the ship re-entered the atmosphere from a science mission on Feb. 1, 2003, destroying the Columbia and killing its crew of seven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the accident, NASA spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars redesigning the tank and modifying methods of applying foam insulation to stop shedding. But when the Discovery flew last July, on the first mission since the Columbia, a greatly reduced but hazardous amount of foam fell from its redesigned tank after launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA then grounded the fleet, and tank engineers removed more than 37 pounds of foam that had formed two air ramps, or deflectors, that protected pressurized fuel lines and a tray guiding cables down the side of the tank. Those were the areas from which the biggest pieces of foam fell during the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said Wednesday that there were other tank parts from which engineers would like to remove foam but that officials had decided it was best to fly with only one major modification at a time, to see if the changes worked as expected.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy manager for the station program, said the venture outside the station was unusual in that part of it would be managed from mission control in Houston while most of it would be orchestrated by the Russian control center near Moscow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the spacewalk, Pavel V. Vinogradov, the Russian station commander, and Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army, the mission flight engineer and NASA science officer, will install a new hydrogen vent valve on the hull of the Zvezda Service Module that is part of the Russian Elektron oxygen-generation system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers will also recover a thruster rocket residue collector and retrieve a contamination-monitoring device and a package of biology experiments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, American controllers are to take control of the excursion as Mr. Vinogradov and Colonel Williams head for the American side of the station, where they are to replace a malfunctioning camera on the Mobile Base System rail car that moves up and down the truss that supports the complex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holly Ridings, spacewalk director for the mission, said Russian and American officials added the camera replacement task to the schedule several weeks ago after the Russians had decided to delay a commercial golf stunt planned by a Canadian company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian officials had cleared Mr. Vinogradov to use golf equipment carried to the station on earlier cargo flights to drive a special ball into orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Element 21 Golf Company in Toronto had paid Russia an unspecified amount for its Golf Shot in Space project, in which a special radio-transmitting ball would be smacked into a three-year orbit of Earth. The company said the promotion was to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Alan B. Shepard Jr.'s famous golf shot on the Moon on the Apollo 14 mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ridings said the Russians did not specify why they delayed the golf stunt, which had raised some early concerns about the swinging club or the ball possibly endangering the station. An American safety review of the proposal is about done, she said, and the venture will probably go ahead, perhaps on a Russian-controlled spacewalk scheduled this fall.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the blimp's ability to communicate would be limited. A message would take about an hour and a half to travel more than 800 million miles to Earth, and any response would take another hour and a half to get to Titan.  </p>

I'm caught in a downdraft. What do I do?'' Or if the blimp were to spot something unusual -- an eruption of an ice volcano -- it might have drifted away before it received the command to take a closer look. The eruption may also have ended by then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, interplanetary robotic explorers have largely been marionettes of mission controllers back on Earth. The controllers sent instructions, and the spacecraft diligently executed them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as missions go farther and become more ambitious, long-distance puppetry becomes less and less practical. If dumb spacecraft will not work, the answer is to make them smarter. Artificial intelligence will increasingly give spacecraft the ability to think for themselves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These technologies are already in operation on specific missions,'' said Steve Chien, a computer scientist who heads the artificial intelligence group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Scientists discussed some of the recent progress last week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAL, the soulful conversationalist at the helm of the spaceship in ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' is not on the drawing board. The work so far has been more along the lines of Roomba, the robotic vacuum cleaner, with autonomy to perform certain specific tasks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chien's group wrote the software that manages the schedule of Earth Observing-1, a satellite that looks for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, wildfires and floods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, known as E.O.-1 for short, takes repeated pictures of the areas it watches, looking for changes that would indicate an eruption or other event. Other satellites or sensors on the ground can also dispatch an alert to E.O.-1, telling it of something it should look at.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Almost immediately, within a matter of hours, the spacecraft is reprogramming itself to image these targets,'' Dr. Chien said, ''and we can get rapid response imagery of breaking science events.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft adds the new observation to its schedule and starts rearranging its other tasks. An observation that had been planned may be canceled or moved. All this occurs without a human in the loop. E.O.-1 just drops a note to the operators about what it has done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When E.O.-1 was launched in 2000, people on the ground did the satellite's planning. The planning software was first tried in 2003, and the satellite now uses it full time. That not only sped up its reaction time, but it also cut its operating cost of $3.6 million a year by more than one-quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar programming can be used for future planetary missions, perhaps for the next visit to Jupiter and its moons, to detect volcanic eruptions on Io or a shift in the fractures on the frozen surface of Europa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's two rovers now on Mars -- the Spirit and the Opportunity -- also possess a measure of thinking ability. As they drive, the rovers use stereo cameras to judge the distance and size of rocks in their paths in order to figure out how to maneuver around obstacles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At every step, it looks at dozens of potential choices,'' said Mark W. Maimone, a member of the team working on the rovers' software. ''It picks the safest path that gets it closer to its goal.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A software upgrade to be sent up to the rovers in a month or so will provide even greater autonomy. Mission controllers will then be able to tell the rovers simply, ''Go to that rock and put your instrument arm down on it.'' Currently, arm deployment takes an extra day, because controllers must first see the rover's final position before issuing the command to lower the arm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another part of the upgrade, adapted from the E.O.-1 software, will enable the rovers to perform a first cut of data, determining what is useful. The rovers have been taking photographs to search for clouds and mini-tornadoes known as dust devils. But through much of the Martian year, clouds and dust devils are rare, so most of the photos show nothing, and beaming them all to Earth is a waste of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're restricted in the number of images you can return,'' said Rebecca Castano of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the new software, the rovers will analyze the photos and send back only those that appear to contain what the scientists are looking for. That will allow wider and more frequent searches. Dr. Castano said tests showed that the software was correct in identifying clouds 93 percent of the time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important, the software rarely failed at finding a cloud when one was there. Rather, the software sometimes saw a cloud when there was none -- a mistake that a scientist on the ground can easily correct.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, these spacecraft seem far from intelligent. E.O.-1's scheduling programs are not that different from the software that Wal-Mart uses to manage inventory, and the rovers' driving autonomy does not give them the ability to recognize unanticipated traps. In April last year, the Opportunity blithely drove into a sand dune, and took five weeks to back out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of the A.I. systems are as smart as a 2-year-old,'' said Cynthia Y. Cheung, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ''We want this system to be able to learn and react to the environment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Cheung is a member of a team led by Steven Curtis designing a more ambitious rover. It does not have wheels. Instead, it looks like a shape-changing jungle gym, with trusses that lengthen and shorten. A simple prototype has been built.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer animations illustrate its possibilities. Across flat terrain, it would roll like tumbleweed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could pull itself, almost catlike, onto rocks or flatten itself and slither through holes. (The animation can be viewed at nytimes.com/science.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To achieve those abilities, the machine would need sensors to observe its surroundings and then use the best mode of locomotion. While some safety rules might be explicitly programmed -- the equivalent of telling a child, ''Do not cross a busy road'' -- the scientists also will put in programming that allows the robot to learn its behavior through trial and error.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'd essentially set up a playground where the robot can perform these simple behaviors,'' said Michael Rilee, another member of the Goddard team. ''It's a lot like what children do when they're very small, and they're just learning to move around.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Curtis said he thought the technology could be ready for a rover to explore the rockier regions of the Moon in a few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much new technology will be built and used is an unanswered question. ''This is a completely different way of doing business,'' Dr. Chien said. ''People are risk averse, for good reasons.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interplanetary space probes cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and a mistake in the programming can lose the craft. An attempt last year to get a small craft named DART, Demonstration of Autonomous Rendezvous Technology, to dock autonomously with another satellite resulted instead in DART's collision with the target.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are also wary about letting a spacecraft throw away information before humans get to sift through it. They often joke about a rover obliviously driving past a dinosaur bone lying on the Martian surface because it had been programmed to recognize only rocks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But autonomy will also allow them to do more at lower cost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some possible missions, like the Titan blimp, ''This sort of thing is going to be key for making the most of the mission,'' said Ralph D. Lorenz, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In an ideal world,'' he added, ''you'd downlink every picture, and scientists would have all of the time in the world to look over them, but you don't have that luxury.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the limited communications with Earth, Dr. Lorenz said the craft might summarize its findings -- that it has been flying over sand dunes, for example -- and send back only a few representative photos instead of images of the entire landscape.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To get the best science, you want to send down only the data with the richest science concentration,'' Dr. Lorenz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for that, Dr. Lorenz is willing to let the spacecraft do the choosing.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of European astronomers said yesterday that they had found one of the closest analogues yet to our solar system: three planets and an asteroid belt circling a pale Sun-like star about 42 light-years away in the constellation Puppis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two innermost of the new Puppis planets, each about 10 times the mass of Earth, are probably rocky like our own home, but they circle too tightly about their star to be habitable.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third planet, about 18 times the mass of Earth, circles at a distance of about 60 million miles, within the star's so-called habitable zone, where the temperatures would allow the existence of liquid water, the authors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is still too big to be considered Earth-like, and is probably shrouded in hydrogen like Neptune or Uranus, and so is an unlikely environment for life. ''Nevertheless,'' Christophe Lovis, of the University of Geneva and lead author of the group, wrote in an e-mail message, ''this discovery opens the way to the detection of even smaller planets in the near future.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery, to be published today in the journal Nature, continues a pattern of planet hunters leapfrogging one another to make discoveries that are increasingly alluring and suggestive of a life-friendly cosmos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Beichman, a planetary astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., called the Puppis system ''a wonderful planetary system,'' that people will be studying a lot over the next few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most of the 190 or so planets that have been discovered orbiting other stars, the Puppis planets were detected indirectly by the slight to-and-fro motion, or wobble, they induce in their home star, called HD 69830.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first planets discovered in that way were giants, so-called hot Jupiters, hundreds of times the mass of Earth, circling very close to their stars, because proximity and large mass make for lots of wobble. As the measuring techniques have improved, the amount of wobble that can be discerned has shrunk, leading to the discovery of smaller Neptune-class planets, including one last year that was only seven times the mass of Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lovis and his colleagues at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla in Chile, used a 12-foot-diameter telescope equipped with a precise spectrograph to detect small wobbles in the Puppis star. It is the first system to be found in which all the planets are in the Neptune class.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists knew there was something extraordinary about HD 69830, which is about 60 percent as luminous and 90 percent as massive as the Sun. Last year astronomers using the Spitzer Space Telescope reported that the star was surrounded by hot dust, probably the result of bumping and grinding in an asteroid belt 30 times more massive that the one in our solar system and the first one discovered around another Sun-like star.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer simulations by the European group suggest that the outermost planet orbits just outside the asteroid belt, where it would act as a gravitational shepherd to keep the belt in order.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for any prospective inhabitants of the Puppis system, however, the greater mass of the asteroid belt means planets there would be under constant bombardment, said Dr. Beichman, who was part of the Spitzer team. The Puppis system, he said, ''would be a tough place to set up camp.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a commentary accompanying the Nature paper, Prof. David Charbonneau of Harvard said it was a mystery how HD 69830 could have such a massive disk of debris around it while the star itself, according to the observations, has a lower abundance of heavy elements, the stuff of planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charbonneau said the results were encouraging to those who hope to someday find Earth-like planets in habitable zones around other stars. In our solar system, that zone extends roughly from Venus to Mars and our planet induces too little wobble to be seen with present instruments. A smaller star would have a smaller habitable zone, and an Earth-like object there would have a bigger, more visible wobble effect.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the European team's precision could be extended to such low-mass stars, Dr. Charbonneau wrote, ''they might just turn up planets akin to our own.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 4 -- NASA has too many tasks and too little money to maintain a vigorous science program, a situation that threatens to erode the nation's leadership in space research and the goal of sending humans to Mars, the National Research Council reported on Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a mismatch between what NASA has been assigned to do and the resources with which it has been provided,'' said Lennard A. Fisk, chairman of the council's Space Studies Board, which wrote the report at the request of Congress.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are particularly concerned that the shortfall in funding for science has fallen disproportionately on small missions and on funding for basic research and technology,'' said Mr. Fisk, a space science professor at the University of Michigan and a former NASA associate administrator for science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has come under heavy criticism from scientists since the Bush administration proposed the agency's 2007 budget, which requested $16.8 billion, including $5.3 billion for space science. But while money would be added to continue flying the space shuttle and completing the International Space Station, the science budget would be held about even for the next four years, $3.1 billion less than officials had expected from earlier estimates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said he had no choice but to take money from science and from the new human exploration program to pay to keep the shuttles flying until they were retired in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budgeting jeopardizes the administration's plan for human exploration of the Moon and Mars, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists were upset not only by the loss of long-term financing but also by decisions on what to cut from the science program. NASA decided to delay or cut some missions and to reduce support for certain areas of research, like astrobiology and space station studies on the effects of microgravity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists representing different disciplines complained that they had not been consulted on what programs might be cut or reduced. Responding to this criticism, the agency asked the NASA Advisory Committee, its main outside consulting group, to convene experts from varied fields to recommend priorities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin cautioned, however, that scientists should make suggestions that stay within current budget limitations and should not ask for more money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fisk presented the new report at a meeting of these experts held at the University of Maryland and told them that his committee was particularly concerned that small, lower-cost space missions would be hit particularly hard and that programs to analyze and study data the agency got back from its space missions would be reduced by 15 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller missions and the data analysis that results in scientific papers are crucial to developing technology for larger missions and training graduate students and young scientists to guide future programs, Mr. Fisk said. These are the foundation programs of NASA, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you disproportionately cut there, you disproportionately cut the pipeline,'' it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fisk said that because Congress had requested his group's report, the committee felt free to recommend that lawmakers allocate more money for NASA to correct expected deficiencies in science. It would take only a relatively small amount directed at the most critical areas to carry NASA science through the five years, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would take about 1 percent of NASA's total budget per year, about $160 million, to ameliorate the damage to research and analysis, and the small missions,'' Mr. Fisk said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar amount, he said, could also sustain microgravity research exploring weightlessness and its effects on a ''life support level'' until more money became available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We not just asking Congress for more money,'' he said. ''We're saying, You, Congress, have an agency you have asked to do a lot of things and then you turn around and say it can't have the resources it needs. It's not just NASA's problem.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a public comment period at the NASA meeting, several scientists and engineers asked the agency to reconsider its priorities.  </p>

So what has Congress been doing to help it along? Not much, judging from revelations that hordes of greedy senators and representatives have siphoned more than half a billion dollars from NASA's budget for the 2006 fiscal year to finance pet projects. It is a terrible diversion of money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is hardly broke. Its appropriation for the 2006 fiscal year was $16.6 billion, an increase from previous years, and Congress seems strongly supportive of an ambitious space program. But that is not enough to pay for returning the shuttle fleet to service, completing the International Space Station and developing a new space vehicle to replace the shuttles.  </p>

That was a record for political pork and another sign of how out of control this kind of spending has become since the Republicans took over Congress, waving a flag of fiscal conservatism. A decade ago only six special items costing $74 million were forced into the NASA budget by earmarking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such diversions cause real harm to important NASA programs.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 28 -- Despite concerns from some of its engineers, NASA has decided to fly the space shuttle Discovery in July without making all potential modifications to its external fuel tank that might reduce damaging foam debris, officials said Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers have removed two large sections of insulating foam from the tank and are still evaluating the effects of that action, the officials said. Work will continue on redesigning or removing all or some of 34 smaller, potentially hazardous foam wedges in the future, but they will fly ''as is'' on the July flight, they said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program, told a televised news conference that the decision to curtail further foam modifications before flying again followed a lively discussion among managers at a program meeting at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. Some engineers argued that the Discovery should not fly until the small foam wedges were modified to reduce their potential for shedding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a strong, concerted opinion from several folks that we should wait until we have a good design on these pieces of foam and then change them before we go flying,'' Mr. Hale said, ''That's not without merit, and we considered it very strongly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But at the end of the day, it is appropriate to make one change at a time with the biggest problem we have, and then work our way to the next situation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing falling fuel tank debris has been a priority for NASA since the loss of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003. Foam insulation falling from the tank during the launching damaged the shuttle's heat shield, causing the craft's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts as the ship returned from a mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Discovery flew last July on the first mission since the Columbia accident, a greatly reduced but still hazardous amount of foam fell from its redesigned tank during launching. Afterward, engineers removed 37 pounds of foam that formed two air ramps, or deflectors, that protected pressurized fuel lines and a tray guiding cables down the tank's side, places from which the biggest pieces of foam fell during the last mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that removing the ramps was ''the largest aerodynamic change that we have made since the shuttle first flew'' and that its effects needed to be well understood before making more modifications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in a flight test program,'' he said. ''When you make a major change, you should fly that major change, and if you have to make additional changes, then you make them after the flight.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said a major factor determining when to launch the Discovery was completing wind tunnel tests to confirm computer predictions that it was safe to fly the fuel tank with the large foam ramps removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers also want to reduce the shedding potential for 34 foam wedges called ice-frost ramps that keep ice from forming around brackets that connect external fuel lines and electrical connectors to the aluminum fuel tank. Ice formed around these connectors is another form of debris that can damage the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some recent wind tunnel tests, engineers tried a new design for smaller foam ice-frost ramps to cover the tank mounting brackets, but the design produced unacceptably large chunks of debris, agency spokesmen said. The current design fared better, they said, but more tests and analysis needed to be done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA wants to fly the shuttle three times before the end of the year to get back on schedule building the International Space Station before the fleet's retirement in 2010.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 25 -- The ability to send humans into space after retiring the space shuttle is such a high priority for NASA that some space science must be sacrificed to help pay for it, the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between retiring the shuttle in 2010 and flying a new manned vehicle by four years after that must be narrowed to prevent long-term damage to the space program and national security, Dr. Griffin said before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas and chairwoman of the subcommittee, and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the ranking Democrat, repeated their concerns that the United States could sacrifice its leadership in space if it were to lose its ability to transport humans while other nations continued to do so. Ms. Hutchinson called the ability for America to continue human spaceflight ''a necessity.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin said that the new spaceship to carry humans, the Crew Exploration Vehicle, should be ready by 2014, and that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was looking at ways to speed its development to deliver it a year or two sooner. The main limit to flying the new ship, which could take crews to the International Space Station and later to the moon, is money, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has reallocated money to keep the shuttle flying and finish the space station, while accelerating plans for the new ship, Dr. Griffin said. While all programs at NASA have been affected by budget restrictions, he said, a big share of the money to ready the new ship had to come from reducing the growth of science programs for a few years, in part by halting some new missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists have expressed outrage at the diversion of money, saying it could mean grave harm to space science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Griffin testified Tuesday, ''I believe that fulfilling our commitments on the International Space Station and bringing the Crew Exploration Vehicle online in a timely manner, not later than 2014 and possibly sooner, is a higher priority than these science missions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long gap in American human spaceflight, as happened between the end of the Apollo moon program and the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981, could cause the nation's space industry to wither as its professionals retire or go into other fields, Dr. Griffin said. The United States' leadership, he said, could be lost if nations like Russia and China continued to send astronauts into space while the United States could not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therefore, Dr. Griffin said, delays in launching the new spacecraft ''are strategically more damaging to our nation's space program than delays to these other science missions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration has requested $16.8 billion for NASA's 2007 budget, including $5.3 billion for space science. But the science budget would stay about even for the next four years, reducing financing for science by $3 billion so the money could go to human spaceflight.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 24 -- A string of distracting accidents, safety incidents and tough technical questions have complicated NASA's efforts to get the space shuttle program back on track.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery is to fly again in July, in only the second mission since the Columbia disaster in February 2003. But there are continuing questions about fuel-tank foam, which doomed the Columbia and bedeviled the Discovery's return-to-flight mission last year, and about other parts on the aging shuttle fleet.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this winter, there were so many accidents -- a robot arm damaged by a moving work platform, a dropped film canister that damaged heat tiles on the shuttle Endeavour, a small fire in the assembly building -- that last month the director of the Kennedy Space Center stopped all work for two hours and lectured employees on safety.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When work resumed the next day, a worker was killed in a fall from a warehouse roof.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, NASA officials insist the Discovery can lift off on time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is two weeks of schedule margin to preserve the July 1 launch date,'' Administrator Michael D. Griffin said last week. ''We're in pretty good shape.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had planned to fly the Discovery in May, but decided to go for the next available launching period, July 1 to July 19, to complete modifications on the large external fuel tank to reduce the chances that it would shed insulating foam and to replace some sensors inside the tank. The delay also allowed engineers more time to deal with other lingering technical issues, like debris in fuel lines and aging electronics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA needs to get at least two shuttle flights off this year to get back on schedule building the International Space Station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010. Officials hope to send three missions aloft this year and then fly four per year to finish the station with 16 flights, plus one mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, before the deadline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview taped for C-SPAN last week, Dr. Griffin said he was not worried about meeting the goal unless shuttle flights did not resume by late this year. ''If we were to back up to the end of the year, I might start to get concerned,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last shuttle mission was in July, when the Discovery made the first flight since the loss of Columbia and its crew of seven. The Columbia accident was caused by a chunk of insulating foam that fell from the shuttle's giant external fuel tank on liftoff and punched a hole in the left wing -- damage that went unnoticed during the Columbia's 16-day mission, though some NASA engineers warned about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Discovery flew last summer, a much smaller but still hazardous amount of foam still fell from its redesigned tank after liftoff. Subsequently, engineers removed more than 37 pounds of foam from the latest model tank, including a long, ramp-shaped section where the biggest piece of significant debris fell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., the director of the shuttle program, said a major factor in determining when to launch the Discovery was completion of wind-tunnel tests to confirm computer predictions that the fuel tank would still be safe even with sections of insulating foam removed from external fuel lines and electrical connectors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the tests, engineers tried a new design for a smaller foam covering to prevent ice buildup on the tank's mounting brackets, but the new design failed and produced unacceptably large chunks of debris, the agency said. An analysis is under way to determine whether to stay with the original covering or choose a new one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technicians have also removed a manhole at the bottom of the fuel tank and replaced a set of sensors designed to shut off the shuttle's main engines when liquid hydrogen runs low. If a faulty sensor shuts off engines too early, the shuttle might not reach orbit. And if the tank runs out of fuel with the engines running, they would be torn apart and the shuttle could be destroyed. One of the sensors, which also had been troublesome before the previous flight, had shown erratic readings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues included whether to replace some of the shuttle's front windows because of uncertainty about whether they were properly certified to withstand high pressure. Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman, said evidence was found that the windows had been tested properly, but three of the six were replaced for other reasons, like small dents sustained in flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers also had to deal with the issue of ''tin whiskers'' in some computer control boxes. Guide rails that hold circuit boards in the boxes are coated with tin, and hairlike crystalline structures sprouted on some of them, perhaps because of age. Concerned about the potential for short circuits, engineers examined the parts and cleared them for the next flight, Mr. Herring said. But he added that NASA had ordered new guide rails made of a different material to be used in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An additional concern for administrators at the Kennedy base is the string of safety-related incidents since the first of the year. The number of reportable safety incidents in which a person was injured or there was property damage in excess of $25,000 was 23 for the first quarter of this year, said Jessica Rye, a Kennedy Center spokeswoman, compared with 15 for the same period in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 17, an outside contractor doing roofing work tripped and fell from atop a warehouse at the base, later dying from his injuries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some NASA officials blamed part of the mishap problem on shuttle workers who were out of practice doing their jobs because of the low rate of spaceflights lately.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''Before the Countdown''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While preparing the shuttle Discovery for a July mission, NASA engineers have confronted an array of nagging problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COCKPIT WINDOWS  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scratches and concerns about certification standards led to the replacement of two of the six windows.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A modified ice/frost ramp performed poorly in wind tunnel tests, shedding more foam than the original ones (above). The ramps prevent ice from forming around connectors on the tank.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The object -- still unnamed more than a year after its discovery but tagged with the temporary designation 2003 UB313 and nicknamed Xena by the discoverer -- covered an area only 1.5 pixels wide in the digital image, taken by the space telescope in December. But that was enough to extract the diameter: 1,490 miles, give or take 60 miles.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A previous estimate by a team of German researchers, based on measurements taken from the ground, had put the diameter at 1,860 miles, or 30 percent more than Pluto's 1,422 (as measured by the Hubble telescope).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Hubble observations should pin down the orbit of a moon circling 2003 UB313, enabling calculation of the planet's mass.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new findings, released yesterday by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the Hubble craft, will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report also found that though small, 2003 UB313 is surprisingly bright, reflecting about 86 percent of the light that hits it. Pluto, itself considered bright, reflects about 60 percent of its incoming light, about twice as much as Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis of the Hubble image was led by Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology. ''It's just crazy -- we were shocked how bright it was,'' Dr. Brown said of 2003 UB313, which he discovered in January 2005 while examining images taken in the fall of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the solar system, only Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, is more reflective than 2003 UB313. Astronomers recently discovered that Enceladus has geysers of water shooting from its south pole; the water, turned to ice crystals, gives the surface a sheen of freshly fallen snow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is unlikely to be the explanation for the brightness of 2003 UB313; it is now too far away (nine billion miles from the Sun) and too cold (minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit) for liquid water to exist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Dr. Brown speculates, the bright surface is a result of a highly eccentric orbit that brings 2003 UB313 as close as 3.5 billion miles from the Sun. When it was nearer, 2003 UB313 was warmer and probably had an atmosphere of methane. As it moved away, the air probably froze and fell to the ground, giving 2003 UB313 a layer of ice, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have not decided whether to name 2003 UB313 an official planet or to demote Pluto. In recent years, many astronomers have said Pluto should be regarded just as a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune, too small to be a full-fledged planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2003 UB313 is almost a twin of Pluto in size, the two distant objects could eventually share the same fate of terminology.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 10 -- A NASA spacecraft will deliberately crash into the Moon in January 2009, in a kind of two-way bank shot that will help scientists search for water that might be lurking in deep, dark craters, the space agency announced Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, the intent is to help find future landing sites for human exploration of the Moon, a goal announced by President Bush in 2004.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier lunar missions identified abundances of hydrogen in craters near the south pole that are permanently shielded from sunlight, leading to speculation that the hydrogen was bound with oxygen in the form of water.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If areas on the Moon contain water ice, officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said, they would be prime landing sites for humans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water can be broken apart to produce hydrogen for rocket fuel and oxygen for fuel and breathing, helping astronauts live off the land while exploring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft -- the first to strike the Moon since the Lunar Prospector, in 1999 -- will be part of a previously announced mission in which a larger craft, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, will fly around the Moon to map its surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both craft will be launched on the same rocket on October 2008, but the smaller impact craft will circle the Earth and Moon for 90 days before slamming into the Moon's south pole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is called Lcross (pronounced L-cross), for Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. Its manager, Daniel Andrews of the space agency's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., said the upper stage of the rocket that was to send the orbiter to the Moon would be used as an impact vehicle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the 4,400-pound used rocket slams into a crater at about 5,600 miles per hour, Mr. Andrews said, it should send up a plume of vapor and debris, perhaps 1,000 metric tons of it, rising 30 to 40 miles above the surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 15 minutes later, the trailing ''shepherding spacecraft,'' loaded with infrared cameras and spectroscopes to determine chemical composition, is to fly through the plume, taking and relaying data before itself hitting the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to see the impact,'' Mr. Andrews said, ''and then fly through the plume while looking into the crater and also looking sideways 90 degrees out into space to see the plume material against the darkness.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Horowitz, the associate NASA administrator in charge of the agency's new exploration initiative, said the opportunity for a second payload came because of a recent decision to use a larger rocket to launch the robotic reconnaissance orbiter. The extra payload capacity allowed NASA to consider supplementing the primary mission with something new, he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This gave us a chance to consider additional high-risk, high-payoff science,'' Mr. Horowitz said after a news conference announcing the new mission. ''We got some terrific proposals for using the extra payload and selected one that buys us an early attempt to look at the resources that may exist on the Moon.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, NASA asked its centers to develop proposals that would increase understanding of the Moon without interfering with the timing and primary mission of the orbiter, which is designed to do high-resolution lunar mapping to find potential landing sites. Officials narrowed an initial batch of 19 proposals to four before selecting Ames's polar impact mission, Mr. Horowitz said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expended rocket will probably be aimed at Shackleton crater, a 12-mile-diameter structure near the Moon's southern axis, Mr. Andrews said. The impact should create a crater about one-third the size of a football field and 16 feet deep.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observatories on Earth as well as various spacecraft will also study the impact, officials said, and some amateur astronomers may be able to observe the event with their telescopes, depending upon weather and their location.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will not be NASA's first effort to do geological studies by smashing robotic probes into distant bodies. In 1999, scientists decommissioned the orbiting Lunar Prospector probe by crashing it into the Moon's south pole, but it disappointed them by producing little or no debris because of its shallow impact angle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the Deep Impact project successfully sent a heavy copper impactor into comet Tempel 1 while a flyby craft monitored the resulting blast and ejected matter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The robotic Moon missions are the first steps in NASA's plans to return astronauts to the Moon by 2018 as a steppingstone to going on to Mars. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission, with the new addition of the impactor, is to cost about $600 million, including the launching rocket, said Butler Hine, a NASA Ames lunar robotics official. The added cost of Lcross is capped at $80 million, Mr. Hine said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Making an Impact''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is planning to send a small spacecraft to the Moon in late 2008 to search for water in lunar craters. Both it and the upper stage of the rocket that launched it will crash into the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOOSTER IMPACT   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upper stage of the booster will crash into a crater on the Moon's south pole. A 2.2-million-pound plume of material, possibly containing water, will be kicked up from the lunar surface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLUME / SATELLITE IMPACT   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small satellite will pass through the plume, making observations. It will then strike the Moon's surface near the booster, creating a second plume. The material from the plumes can be observed from Earth and other satellites.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASIDE from its intermittent disasters, our manned space program would seem to offer contemporary novelists just about the most ho-hum subject matter on the whole gaudy national landscape. Given the uninspiring repetitions of the shuttle, skeptical readers must have greeted Stephen Harrigan's intention of writing a novel about ''the daily lives of astronauts'' by asking if it would be called ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Space Suit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, for one thing, the book's principal astronaut turns out to be a woman, and for another, ''Challenger Park'' turns out to be a fine, absorbing achievement, probably the best science-factual novel about the space-faring worlds of Houston and Cape Canaveral in the nearly half-century since the first astronauts were chosen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set between the catastrophes of Challenger and Columbia, Harrigan's story focuses on the life of Lucy Kincheloe, a conscientious, undemonstrative New Englander who, after years of waiting, has been given a spot on STS-108 (a mission that actually flew in December 2001). As the book opens, the principal drag on her career appears to be her husband, Brian, a bitter veteran of two shuttle missions, one of which carried him up for an extended stay on the rustbucket Soviet space station Mir. There, ''in a now famous diatribe, he unleashed a torrent of pent-up grievances'' to NASA ground controllers. (Students of the real-life American space program may be tempted to read Brian as a refraction of the astronaut Jerry M. Linenger.) After a second screw-up, beset with ''flagging health and fading reputation,'' Brian finds himself headed for part-time college teaching and ''Dine With an Astronaut'' bookings with tourists visiting Florida's space coast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longstanding emotional chill around Lucy's marriage had always been mitigated by the sense of obligation she and Brian felt to each other, to their careers and to their two small children, one of them badly asthmatic. But Brian's taut pride collapses when Lucy gets her big chance. Breaking a promise to her, he impulsively quits the space program and subjects her to a loud scene in front of their colleagues. As Lucy's training progresses, Harrigan nicely dovetails her personal anxieties with the simulation of emergencies in space. (She starts to see her daughter's fears as ''a minor mal that could safely be bypassed for the moment while she dealt with the greater danger of her son's health.'') Even so, at crucial points in the run-up to the launch she's noticeably off balance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucy comes to realize that her chances of remaining with the mission will be saved or doomed by the attraction she and Walt Womack, the training team's leader, are feeling. A 50-ish widower, physically unprepossessing and at least as conscientious as Lucy, Walt poignantly regards himself ''as a kind of falconer, never leaving the earth but reaping satisfaction from the sight of his winged comrade spiraling out of sight, trained by him, charged by him, and in some way carrying his consciousness into the heavens.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In dealing with Walt and Lucy, Harrigan isn't afraid -- many novelists would be -- to explore decency as a character trait. Struggling, in NASA lingo, to keep everything ''nominal,'' his central characters are almost as well behaved as the leads in ''Brief Encounter,'' and when desire does get the better of them, Harrigan fast-forwards past most of the sex, as if he knows it would be a waste of fuel. This is a smart decision, since his talents are better suited to depicting the relationship's emotional intricacies. And the payoff he achieves is subtle and intense; a marvel, really. The two dutiful, abashed and guilty people he's created strike me as the most refreshing literary lovers in a long, overheated time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A veteran journalist for Texas Monthly, Harrigan has snugly Velcroed his plot to the warp and woof of actual NASA routine: the astronauts' prelaunch rituals, the minutiae of mission-patch design and the Bible study groups of Johnson Space Center employees. The density always gathers naturally, not as some data dump from a reporter's notebook. Harrigan does an especially good job with the physical peculiarities of space flight, from the weightless mosquito Lucy notices in front of her visor during liftoff to the way astronauts back on Earth will ''thoughtlessly let go'' of a glass they're holding, expecting it to ''hover in place'' instead of shattering on the floor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author's previous book was a historical novel, ''The Gates of the Alamo,'' and in this new one he allows the shuttle and the space station to experience their own sort of deadly siege. The plot twist that allows him to keep Lucy aloft for months instead of weeks is splendidly executed, in part because Harrigan keeps the thrills and derring-do to a sensible level. He knows that his real psychological business is to keep Lucy wan, anxious and depleted of bone mass -- while back in Houston Walt holds a vigil whose true nature he must disguise from almost everyone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An understated style serves the author well through each planetary turn. This is a stately novel whose emotional precision is matched by the exactitude of its prose. (Harrigan's extended description of Walt's ''negligently bare'' apartment has such a bravura accuracy that it ends up seeming oddly vivid.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Harrigan can't fully rise above is the shuttle's own low-earth orbit. No matter how often he refers to ''voyagers'' or ''outer space'' or what it is to ''leave behind'' the earth, nothing will make that spacecraft do anything but go around in circles. Once launched, his characters remain as governed by gravity as the people waiting for them back in Texas. The mission plan for the fictional STS-108 is described, during the training of its crew, as being ''pretty close to the ideal of a routine flight.'' Its numbing, desired nominality is evident in the usual complement of inane experimental payloads the astronauts carry with them (''an automatic incubator for studying the effects of microgravity on Japanese quail eggs'').  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrigan doesn't completely evade the issue, but he doesn't fully confront it either -- except through the fine irony that, unlike the vehicle it rides, ''Challenger Park'' actually takes you somewhere.  </p>

He has waved the Brazilian flag, talked with schoolchildren, reporters and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and even found himself lionized in a comic book and toys.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many Brazilian scientists, along with newspaper columnists and editorial writers, have criticized the voyage, which ends early Sunday, as a boondoggle. They argue that the roughly $10.5 million that Brazil paid Russia to launch Colonel Pontes aboard a Soyuz rocket would have been better spent on research here on Earth or invested in rebuilding a space port destroyed in 2003 in a launching pad explosion that killed 21 scientists and technicians.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scientific value of this voyage is almost nil,'' Ennio Candotti, a physicist who is the president of the Brazilian Society for the Progress of Science, complained to reporters. He also described Colonel Pontes as a ''space tourist'' and a ''paying hitchhiker,'' and dismissed the astronaut's eight on-board experiments as ''simply for show.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials, however, say the gains in putting a Brazilian in space are scientific and political. They want to double the budget of the space program, chronically short of funds, to $200 million a year, and view increased public support for the effort and understanding of it as the best ways to persuade the Brazilian Congress to loosen purse strings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea is to give visibility to the program,'' Sergio Gaudenzi, the director of the Brazilian Space Agency, said in an interview here on Thursday. A decade ago, he added, ''China, Brazil and India were all at the same level, but China has surged ahead, and we have been left behind,'' largely because of a lack of sustained investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more money, Mr. Gaudenzi said, Brazil would be able to build four additional launching pads at its equatorial Alcantara base, considered one of the best launching sites in the world because the Earth's rotation is faster there, making it easier and cheaper to put a vehicle into orbit. Brazil also plans to build and launch up to three geostationary communications satellites, and needs to develop its own rocket in order to do so, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The origins of Colonel Pontes's voyage go back to 1997, when Brazil was invited, at NASA's behest, to be one of 16 nations participating in the International Space Station project. In return for manufacturing certain parts for the station, at an estimated cost of $120 million, Brazil would receive the right to send someone into space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States was eager to have Brazil involved because Washington wants to increase scientific exchanges with a country that has excelled in several niches. Brazil is a recognized leader, for example, in the manufacture of medium-size jets, genome mapping and numerous technologies adapted for use in the tropics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brazil informed the consortium in 2001 that it would not be able to meet the first deadline, in part because funds were lacking. It then missed a second deadline, and Colonel Pontes's mission was put on indefinite hold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a visit to Russia late last year, Mr. da Silva, rather than lose the money already invested in Colonel Pontes's training, signed an agreement that made the Brazilian astronaut a paying customer aboard a Russian spacecraft. Russia also agreed to help Brazil develop a liquid fuel rocket, the weak spot in a program that has had some success in building and launching satellites.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the 2003 funeral of the victims of the Alcantara disaster, Mr. da Silva promised that Brazil would still launch its first rocket into space by the time his term ended, at the end of this year. But Mr. Gaudenzi said that target had been abandoned as unrealistic, with 2009 set as the most likely new date for a launching attempt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Pontes's space voyage is officially known as the Centennial Mission, a reference to Brazil's pioneering aviator Alberto Santos Dumont. Brazilians are taught that Santos Dumont, not the Wright Brothers, was the first man to fly, before cheering throngs in Paris in 1906. Colonel Pontes has even been photographed aboard the space station wearing one of Santos Dumont's trademark white Panama hats.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Few have been the moments in which we've been as proud of a Brazilian as we are of you,'' Mr. da Silva, who must win an October election if he is to have a second term, said during a televised 14-minute conversation with the astronaut on Wednesday. ''What we are spending is little compared to what this could represent for Brazilian space policy.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEVE JONES doesn't have a workshop, exactly, for his miniature space elevator; he is designing it in his dorm room and in four labs scattered across the University of British Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He doesn't have a staff, either; a collection of friends and fellow space enthusiasts volunteer to help. And his budget, in the low five figures, comes mostly from the school activities fund, although Red Bull is donating some energy drinks.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he might soon have a chance to join the ranks of the aerospace establishment by getting money from NASA and, in his own way, helping explore the solar system. To get ready, he is spending 60 hours a week on his elevator, which is meant to haul people and gear into orbit without a rocket. He has even put off graduation until the project is done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the chances that a college senior like Mr. Jones would contribute to the NASA space program were remote. Contracts belonged mostly to the Boeings of the world. Tinkerers and students were kept at the far edge of the periphery. But with budgets tightening and the obstacles to human space exploration looking more daunting, NASA is enlisting the expertise of outsiders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the agency is offering 13 contests, which it calls Centennial Challenges, that anyone can enter. The prizes range from $200,000 to more than $5 million, for building gear as diverse as solar sails, lunar excavators and the tiny elevators.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more important than the cash prizes, contestants and administrators say, is the opportunity to sidestep the traditional ways NASA has done business and bring some fresh faces to its ranks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a regular contract, a small group of students like us wouldn't have a chance,'' Mr. Jones said. ''This way, anyone with a good idea can contribute.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones hadn't thought much about contests until the X Prize, the $10 million competition to get private spacecraft into suborbital flight. He was drawn to the idea that entrepreneurs could go into space. So when NASA announced its first Centennial Challenges, Mr. Jones signed up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitors in the Beam Power Challenge -- which includes the elevator component -- had to make a two-foot-tall machine powered by light or microwaves that could crawl up a 200-foot rubber-coated fiber ribbon. Space enthusiasts hope that such a machine -- an elevator, of sorts -- could one day reach 62,000 miles into the sky, delivering people and packages into orbit at a fraction of the cost of today's launchings. The winner would be, in effect, one of the space elevator's earliest drafts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the contest was held last October, none of the eight entrants made it all the way up the ribbon. But Mr. Jones's Snowstar machine traveled farthest, all of 20 feet. The hexagonal array of solar cells, powering two pairs of rollers that shimmied up the ribbon, was judged Most Likely to Win in the 2006 challenge, set for August. The prize has been increased to $250,000 this year, from $50,000. To win, the climbers must make it up the ribbon in less than a minute. So far, 19 teams have signed up, nearly twice as many as in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another well-known high-tech contest, the Darpa Grand Challenge, also had disappointing results when it started in 2004. The all-robot off-road rally, sponsored by the Pentagon's fringe science arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, attracted dozens of competitors. But none of the vehicles made it past the seventh mile of the 150-mile course, largely because of navigation problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, five unmanned cars crossed the finish line. That included robots from leading universities like Stanford and Carnegie Mellon as well as one from the Gray Insurance Company, which had no experience in robotics but whose owners had a personal interest in the competition. The Gray team was one of the last to enter the contest, and it had a major setback when Hurricane Katrina wrecked its New Orleans workshop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, it beat out vehicles built by leading computer-science researchers and backed by defense contractors. It did so well that it has pulled some employees from the insurance side of the business, allowing them to focus on the company's new venture: robotic cars for the military and other entities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never thought I'd work in defense,'' said Paul Trepagnier, a software development manager at Gray. ''I'm a Tom Clancy fan. But that's the extent. I mean, I'm just a programmer in an insurance company.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of NASA's contests also center on robotics. The Telerobotic Construction Challenge, scheduled for August 2007, requires a team of machines to assemble items with minimal human supervision. The idea is to let robots, instead of astronauts, build shelters and machinery on the moon and Mars. In the Regolith Excavation Challenge, set for May 2007, an autonomous machine will have to dig through 24 square meters of simulated moon rock. A separate Regolith Oxygen competition, scheduled for 2008, will be held for robots that can extract oxygen from the stones. Some contests will be held annually; others will be one-time events.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA funds robotics research through conventional contracts too, and it uses Small Business Innovation Research grants to back companies outside the industry's mainstream. But the paperwork involved in the innovation research grants, called S.B.I.R.'s, can be intimidating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have the grant-writing experience to get one of those,'' said Matthew Abrams, one of the competitors. ''The contest seemed like a better deal. And winning something like this can give us the credibility and the contacts to go after S.B.I.R.'s.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competitions offer economic benefits to NASA as well. The contestants, not the space agency, pay for the development. The winner of a big technology prize usually spends three times the purse value, said Carl E. Walz, a former astronaut who works in NASA's exploration systems mission directorate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Typically in R. &amp; D., you pay as you go,'' Mr. Walz said, referring to NASA's outlays for research and development. ''You pay for failures and you pay for successes. Here, you don't pay until someone wins.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials say that some of their contractors are worried that the contests could undermine their work for the space agency. NASA already has companies working on gloves for its space suits; why, then, does it need an Astronaut Glove Challenge? Exactly how good ideas from the competitions will be integrated into the space program isn't entirely clear. ''We're still writing the book on this,'' Mr. Walz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within NASA, enthusiasm for the challenges seems to be growing. The agency announced six more contests in February, including $5 million for the first team that can store or produce rocket fuel in orbit and $2.5 million for the builders of a working solar sail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they win, both Mr. Jones and Mr. Abrams said they hoped to use their prize money to enter some of these more complex challenges, like the lunar lander competition being held by NASA and the X Prize Foundation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregg E. Maryniak, executive vice president of the foundation, said he looked forward to having them enter. ''One of the biggest reasons to do this is to bring in people outside the existing ecosystem,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look, a hundred years ago, a couple of pesky bike mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, bested, in effect, the government-funded player, to become the first to fly,'' he added. ''That's why you put on these things: to attract the bicycle mechanics.''  </p>

But what do engineers and space scientists do when NASA puts one of their missions in mothballs?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, after an appeals process, the space agency reinstated Dawn, a mission to explore two of the largest asteroids in the solar system. The decision came five months after NASA halted work on the project in order to investigate cost overruns and technical problems, and less than a month after the agency had decided to cancel it outright.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the on-again, off-again nature of the project hasn't affected the spacecraft itself -- it sits half-built at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., -- it has put many of the lab's workers on a roller coaster ride.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of the people working on Dawn had been assigned to other projects; they will now be moved back to the mission, said D. C. Agle, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the hiatus, the remaining people on the project worked to provide answers to an outside team of reviewers. They also helped to resolve the major technical issues, most of them involving the spacecraft's ion engine, an unconventional design that will push it forward by shooting charged xenon atoms out the back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching date, which managers had already anticipated slipping from June to August, has now slipped a full year, to summer 2007. The mission's cost has risen to $446 million from $373 million -- but those overruns were already tabulated before the project was put in limbo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has not changed is the arrival date at the two asteroids, which orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Because of the fortuitous alignment of the orbits, Dawn will reach its two destinations -- the asteroids Vesta and Ceres -- at the previously scheduled times: Vesta in 2011 and Ceres in 2015.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm astonished,'' said Lucy-Ann McFadden, an astronomer at the University of Maryland and a member of the mission's science team. ''I'm excited. I'm ready to go. I was still in denial that we got canceled.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally scheduled to be launched this summer, Dawn will instead blast off in summer 2007.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several months of exploration, the spacecraft will blast out of orbit and head to Ceres, the largest of all asteroids, at 600 miles wide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn is part of the space agency's Discovery program of modestly priced missions that go from approval to flight in less than five years. Because of cost overruns and technological difficulties -- instead of traditional rocket fuels, the spacecraft will use an ion engine, firing a stream of charged xenon atoms -- NASA stopped work on the project in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on March 2, after an independent panel found that the mission was running 20 percent over its $373 million budget, NASA killed the mission. About $257 million had already been spent, and about half of the hardware, including the scientific instruments, had been built.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An uproar followed among the project's scientists and managers, who said that problem areas like the fuel tank had been largely overcome and that the orbits of Ceres and Vista would not allow another two-for-one asteroid mission for years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many also saw it as further evidence that NASA was cannibalizing its science missions to pay for the space shuttle and the space station and future plans to send astronauts back to the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is building the Dawn spacecraft, appealed the decision, a new process put in place as part of an agency reorganization by the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin. A group led by Rex D. Geveden, a NASA associate administrator, conducted a review, and in a telephone news conference yesterday, Mr. Geveden said the technical issues had now been resolved to his satisfaction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's work to do,'' Mr. Geveden said, ''but the way forward seems pretty clear.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA now estimates that Dawn will cost $446 million, an increase of $73 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleen Hartman, deputy associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate, said NASA's 2007 budget already took into account a 20 percent increase in Dawn's budget, so the reinstatement would not lead to additional cuts in other missions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of favorable alignment of the orbits, the one-year delay in launching will not delay the spacecraft's arrival at the asteroids.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroids are remnants of the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago, pieces of a planet that failed to coalesce between Mars and Jupiter. Studying the largest miniplanets should provide valuable clues to the formation of the Sun and the planets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McFadden said recent observations from Earth showed that asteroids were more interesting than once thought. ''They're not just rocks in space,'' she said. ''They're planets.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceres, for example, is rounder than expected, she said, suggesting that it could have an interior structure with different layers of different materials, much like the larger planets. The roundness could be the result of an underground layer of ice that offsets the force of spinning.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mike Mullane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 368 pp. Scribner. $26.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LATE in 1986, nine months after the disaster that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed its crew, Mike Mullane made an appointment with Terry McGuire, a psychiatrist consulting with NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mullane, an astronaut of eight years' experience, was far from eager to consult a witch doctor. He was certain, he writes in his memoir, ''Riding Rockets,'' that he would become ''the first astronaut in the history of NASA to voluntarily see a shrink. I would be admitting failure. I would be violating the 'Better dead than look bad' commandment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mullane's superiors, he told McGuire, were driving him nuts. They would not reveal how shuttle crews were chosen or even who chose them. They would not hear suggestions for improving the shuttle's safety and its performance. They would not communicate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGuire lent Mullane a 10-page document written by himself, called ''Leadership as Related to Astronaut Corps.'' ''In the last eight years or so, the dissatisfaction level relative to management style has risen significantly,'' McGuire wrote. The astronaut executive had become an ''autocratic power merchant.'' Bureaucratic tactics like ''inconsistency, ambiguity, silence, evasion . . . all have their place in his studied unpredictability.'' Could such things be? What happened to the Right Stuff?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one respect, Mullane seems to be telling us, there was too much of the Right Stuff in the late 1980's. There were more astronauts -- 100 or so -- than available slots. Most of them had backgrounds like Mullane's: picked military fliers, macho men unacquainted with failure, products of a grueling selection process and endless training. Now they were miserable nothings without crew assignments, and their value for the space program was attenuated by their terror of saying anything that might jeopardize their chances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ah! what joy for Mullane and his like to receive at last a crew assignment, to blast off atop four million pounds of propellant, to perform perfectly for the pleasure of perfection and the preservation of life, all the while being consciously terrified. Counting down toward his second liftoff, in December 1988, he observes, ''My fear was 'off-scale high.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like everyone else, astronauts have parents, and we hear enough about Mullane's, who were supportive and courageous. His wife, Donna, was even more so. Other compulsory subjects, not so well covered when astronauting was young, include vomiting in zero G and the complications of the space toilet, a device so counterintuitive (necessarily) it took Mullane nearly 30 minutes to finish his task.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mullane's astronaut class of 1978 included several names not yet forgotten, including those of Sally Ride and Judy Resnik. Late in the book, glancing back on a life not all that dedicated to exploring social issues, Mullane piously declares: ''By far, the greatest personal change my NASA experience had wrought was in my perception of women. I learned that they are real people with dreams and ambitions and only need the opportunity to prove themselves.'' How about that, friends of equal rights?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman above all attracted Mullane's attention: Resnik, 28 when he met her, a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, a classical pianist and, as he frequently notes, a looker. The Discovery mission of August 1984 was the first flight for both of them, and they had become fast friends during months of training. Readers, of course, know Resnik is going to die on the Challenger in two years, and Mullane is writing with hindsight. All the same, there's a convincing test of his moral animal in an evening alone with her at the astronauts' Cape Canaveral beach house, the only occasion when Resnik, not always a happy woman, opened her soul ''as if I were some harmless confidant.'' He did not squeeze her hand, pat her on the back or otherwise set free his raging hormones, he says. Even an ironclad feminist like Sally Ride should give him a passing grade, I think.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addressing nearly 15,000 employees over closed-circuit television, James W.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MY daughter, Mira, calls it the big boom, the asteroid impact that spelled the death of the dinosaurs. She's only 3 and still gets scared, or so she says, when it comes up on her favorite Disney dinosaur movie, so I don't think I will be taking her to ''Cosmic Collisions,'' a new show at the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the dinosaur boom, as portrayed here from space, is so scary. But that boom, as the new show makes clear, is only one -- and not the most violent one at that -- of a series of cataclysms that have punctuated and continue to shape the history of the cosmos and the life in it.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for example, the show's piece de resistance, in which a small planet sideswipes young Earth, blasting itself and a chunk of Earth into a spray of molten drops shimmering like blobs of mercury. The seats shake, the music screams.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, scientists say, is how the Moon was formed. Within a month, some of the blobs had cooled and congealed into what would become that friendly pale face in the sky. And we have that whack to thank for our seasons; it knocked Earth off kilter and left its rotation axis tilted with respect to the Sun. Not to mention the tides, caused by the gentle gravitational churning of the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cosmic Collisions,'' narrated in a calm voice by Robert Redford, pays homage to a new perspective on cosmic history that belies the serene image of lights wheeling peacefully and predictably, stars evolving nearly imperceptibly. Sometimes things happen quickly, out of the blue, and by chance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years in the making, the new show was produced in collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science; Goto Inc., makers of planetarium projectors in Tokyo; and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanying the press kit for the show was a list of dozens of scientists and laboratories whose data and supercomputer simulations of everything from the evolution of stars in a cluster to Earth's magnetic field have formed the basis for the show. When we see the Sun popping off sparks and rays and arcs of incandescent gas like an angry New Year's Eve ball, we are looking at actual spacecraft images of the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When, at the end, we sail off into deep space, each of the glowing smudges that we sail past corresponds to a real galaxy mapped by astronomers and painstakingly projected on the big dome around us.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realism is palpable. After that Moon-forming collision, which comes early in the 20-minute show, I could not endure the image of a rock intruding upon the sky without feeling an anticipatory jolt of adrenaline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all the events depicted here are so literally earthshaking. Some are even microscopic -- protons colliding inside the Sun produce the thermonuclear energy that makes it shine and makes plants grow on Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are ethereal. Waves of high-speed particles blasted from the Sun clash soundlessly in the near vacuum of the upper atmosphere with the bubblelike protective structure of Earth's magnetic field, creating electrical storms that can interfere with radio transmissions and the wavering curtains of light called auroras that decorate the polar nights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this show were a symphony, the section on the Sun and the aurora would be a flute solo, but most of us will have come for the crescendos, the planet-cleansing life-changing events, the big booms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appearance of something new in the sky, like comets, was often regarded as a bad omen, Mr. Redford says at the beginning, as we watch a dark rock appear in a dark Milky Way-lighted sky over the Adirondacks. It spouts fountains of gas liberated by the Sun's heat and then spits meteorites from its tail as it passes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space, we know, is big and mostly empty. The odds that an asteroid might hit Earth in any given year are only one in a million, Mr. Redford explains. Those odds might sound reassuring until we remember that Earth is 4.5 billion years old.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell that to the dinosaurs, whose reign on Earth was abruptly cut off 65 million years ago. It was then, astronomers and geologists have concluded, that a particularly nasty rock appeared in the sky. An asteroid seven miles in diameter, apparently nudged from its normal orbit between Jupiter and Mars, ploughed into the sea near what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico at 40,000 miles an hour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From space we see a fireball the size of a continent. The entire Earth, we are told, baked at 500 degrees for an hour. Soot blackened the atmosphere for months, blocking light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the species on Earth went extinct, but among the survivors were our own ancestors, who might not have gotten the chance to thrive and take over without the demise of everybody else.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question looms, as we see yet another big rock take aim at Earth (the music swells again), whether we could go the way of the dinosaurs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happily, that need not be the case. Given enough warning, according to new studies, we could nudge an incoming asteroid off its collision course by flying a spacecraft by it and giving it a gravitational tug. This is the opposite of the gravitational slingshot effect used to fling spacecraft to the outer solar system by sending them past planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the new rock passes without the money shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little we can do, however, about a much bigger collision fated to happen billions of years in the future, when the Milky Way galaxy, in which the Sun and its retinue reside, and the Andromeda galaxy, some two million light years away now but closing in, collide and merge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step-by-step computer simulations, in which each second represents 40 million years, show the two spiral galaxies, spinning like jeweled spiders, approach, flow through each other, separate as arms of stars flow gracefully akimbo and then draw together again in a double-yoked embrace, finally merging to become a giant egg-shaped agglomeration billions of years from now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because colliding galaxies are so vast, the stars and planets in them would probably just slide by one another, Mr. Redford tells us. What will collide, he says, is the gas and dust that fills the lanes of each galaxy. As the gas compresses and heats, those collisions will produce countless new stars and planets -- new arenas for whatever life might populate the new enlarged galaxy as it sails on into the universe's golden years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whoever lives there someday will be able to thank this collision for the spark of life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without such collisions, the Milky Way wouldn't exist. And probably, neither would we, Mr. Redford says as we cruise outward through the galaxies, a journey I was sorry to end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning tomorrow, ''Cosmic Collisions'' will be shown at the Hayden Planetarium daily every 30 minutes, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (until 7 p.m. on the first Friday of every month), except at noon and 3 p.m. when the system is maintained.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., the space shuttle program manager, said that replacing questionable sensors in the external fuel tank to be used by the shuttle Discovery would make a launching impossible during the planned target window of May 10 to May 23.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a televised news conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Mr. Hale said the next target dates would be July 1 to July 19.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wish it had worked out differently,'' Mr. Hale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he added, the extra six weeks will ease the hectic preparation schedule that engineers and technicians had been working under and perhaps allow for some optional work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a delayed launching, Mr. Hale said, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration could still mount three shuttle flights this year and resume construction on the International Space Station. ''I remain optimistic,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA plans to fly 17 shuttle missions before retiring the fleet in 2010. That schedule will require a return to the steady launching rate that was disrupted by the loss of the Columbia and its crew on Feb. 1, 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's flight last July, the first since the Columbia disaster, was plagued by a problem with the fuel sensors. If they erroneously register that the tanks contain fuel when they are actually empty, a catastrophic engine shutdown could occur.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that although only one of four major engine cutoff sensors had given questionable readings in tests, all of them would be replaced with updated versions for safety reasons. The older sensors, made in 1996, have platinum wires that appear to come loose with movement, resulting in unpredictable readings, he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial studies of some of the cometary particles returned by Stardust found materials believed formed near the Sun in the early history of the solar system and somehow ejected into the cold, distant regions where comets form, they said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first results from the $212 million Stardust project are being presented this week at the National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration's annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in nearby League City, Tex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 100-pound sample container from Stardust returned to Earth on Jan. 15, ending a seven-year mission. The spacecraft flew within 149 miles of the comet Wild 2 near Jupiter on Jan. 2, 2004. It extended a collector filled with a material called aerogel, a low-density silicon material composed of 99.8 percent empty space, to slow and trap particles without significantly damaging them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust also spent part of its long journey collecting the particles from stars. These instellar particles constantly flow through the solar system from far out in space; they are still in storage and have not yet been counted or examined, researchers said at the news conference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington, the mission's principal investigator, said scientists had long believed that comets contained primal material from the edges of the solar system and that the material had never been heated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Stardust captured particles from Wild 2 that contained minerals that form at temperatures of 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interesting thing is we are finding these high-temperature minerals in materials from the coldest place in the solar system,'' Dr. Brownlee said. Studying the chemical composition of the heated particles should determine if they are from the hot formation of the inner solar system 4.6 billion years ago or perhaps from stars farther away.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Zolensky, the sample curator and a co-investigator at the Johnson center, said finding crystals formed by heat could support a model of solar system formation in which material coalesced in the center around the early Sun as jets of material also shot outward toward the more distant, colder regions.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a journey of seven months and 310 million miles, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a large robotic spacecraft crammed with six scientific instruments, performed an intricate ballet of turns and engine firings to complete the crucial step of entering Mars's orbit without careering into space.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, mission controllers at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., announced that everything had gone as planned and that the craft was orbiting Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got complete control of a healthy spacecraft,'' a controller said as the room broke into applause.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter is to spend at least two years searching for signs of life on Mars and scouting possible landing spots for future spacecraft and astronauts. It is equipped to send back 10 times as much data as all previous probes combined.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first it had to enter orbit, a goal that had eluded several missions in the past two decades. Three spacecraft are orbiting Mars now: two from the United States and one from Europe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a later news conference, Charles Elachi, the laboratory director, said that with Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter joining this fleet, along with two NASA rovers on the surface, the United States had established a scientific foothold on Mars similar to that on remote Antarctica.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really do have a permanent presence around that planet,'' Dr. Elachi said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reconnaissance Orbiter's main engines ignited on schedule at 4:24 p.m., Eastern time, to begin a 27-minute firing meant to slow the craft enough to find its orbit. ''Burn, baby, burn,'' an engineer exclaimed as telemetry confirmed the start of the rocket firing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firing, 1,800 miles from Mars, reduced the orbiter's speed to about 8,800 miles per hour, from 11,000 m.p.h. Tension mounted 21 minutes into the rocket firing when the spacecraft slipped behind the planet, as planned, and controllers had to wait until the orbiter emerged at 5:16 p.m. to confirm that it had survived and was in orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contact with the orbiter occurred on schedule. ''Oh, look, it's right on the money!'' shouted an engineer. ''Right on the money!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Graf, the project manager, said controllers had had to confirm that the craft had achieved its planned initial orbit, a long ellipse that extends from 250 miles to 28,000 miles above the surface of the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was very relieved,'' Mr. Graf said in a NASA television interview. ''It was picture-perfect.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft began its journey last Aug. 12, when it left Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard an Atlas rocket. The flight path was so precise that controllers were able to cancel some rocket firings that had been planned to correct its trajectory. Howard Eisen, the flight system manager for the mission, said that the two-ton craft had saved 60 pounds of fuel by avoiding the corrections and that this could be used to extend the orbiter's mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the satellite is in orbit around Mars, scientists will have to wait until fall for it to be maneuvered into the proper lower orbit before they can begin their study of the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the orbiter will go through a seven-month period of dipping into and out of the atmosphere to drain off energy and lower itself slowly into a working orbit less than 200 miles above the surface. This technique, called aerobraking, saved more than 1,100 pounds of launching weight, which allowed the spacecraft to be flown on a smaller rocket and saved millions of dollars, Mr. Graf said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the spacecraft begins the series of 500 braking dips into the Mars atmosphere in about three weeks, Mr. Graf said, engineers will take a few images with its cameras. These will be engineering images to check the health of the systems, not the detailed scientific pictures expected when the spacecraft reaches its lower working altitude, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's instruments will stay in hibernation during the months of aerobraking, said Michael Meyer, chief Mars scientist at NASA headquarters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six instruments that will study Mars during the $720 million mission are expected to revolutionize studies of the planet, Dr. Meyer said. These include the most powerful telescopic camera ever sent to another planet; an advanced mineral mapper to identify water-related areas; radar to probe beneath the surface for buried ice and water; and a weather camera that will monitor the planet daily.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will also serve as a communications satellite, relaying signals back to Earth from future craft that land on Mars to explore.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Success''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a seven month journey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter successfully entered orbit around Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday The spacecraft fired its braking rockets just before passing behind the planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By October Dragging against Mars's atmosphere, or aerobraking, the spacecraft will move to an orbit 158 to 199 miles above Mars by October.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon, Enceladus, is only 300 miles wide, and usually something that small is nothing more than a frozen chunk of ice and rock. Instead, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has spotted eruptions of icy crystals, which hint at pockets of liquid water near the surface.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's startling,'' said Carolyn C. Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo., leader of the imaging team for Cassini. Nine scientific papers about Enceladus (pronounced en-SELL-ah-dus), appear in today's issue of Science. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see the planetary community clamoring for a future exploratory expedition to land on the south polar terrain of Enceladus,'' said Dr. Porco, lead author of one of the papers. ''We have found an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life requires at least three ingredients -- water, heat and carbon-based molecules -- and Enceladus may possess all three. As Cassini flew through the plumes of vapor and ice crystals rising into space from the eruptions, it also detected simple carbon-based molecules like methane and carbon dioxide, which suggest more complicated carbon molecules may lie on the moon's surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of a crater suggests that the heat is not the result of a meteor's impact. Based on initial observations, some scientists think that this warm region near the south pole may have persisted for billions of years, sufficient time for life to arise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an exciting place,'' said James W. Head III, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University, who was not involved with any of the research reported in today's Science. ''That's what exploration is all about. You go out there. It isn't A. It isn't B. It isn't C. It's D, none of the above.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists pointed to the discovery as an argument for continuing NASA's space science efforts. The agency's proposed budget would cut $3 billion from space science over the next five years to help pay for the completion of the space station and plans to send astronauts back to Earth's Moon. NASA's astrobiology institute, which finances research on the possibility of life elsewhere in the solar system and universe, is to see its budget cut in half.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They must provide sufficient funds for NASA to conduct both human flight and robotic exploration missions,'' Dr. Porco said. ''Right now, the funding is inadequate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini flew by Enceladus three times last year. For the first two flybys, Cassini's observations of Enceladus' equatorial region turned up nothing odd -- except that it seemed to be deflecting Saturn's magnetic fields, implying that Enceladus had a thin atmosphere of charged atoms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA tweaked the trajectory of Cassini's July flyby to pass within about 110 miles of Enceladus' surface. For the first time, the spacecraft got a look at the south pole, which turned out to be smooth compared with the pockmarked northern hemisphere. And it was warm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expectation was that the temperature would be about minus-330 degrees Fahrenheit. It turned out more than 100 degrees warmer. ''Which is fairly dramatic and blew us away when we first saw it,'' said John R. Spencer, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder and a team member working with a Cassini instrument that measures infrared emissions. ''It's a lot of heat to come out of such a tiny object.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Images of the moon also showed towering plumes of ice crystals coming off at high speed from the surface. The jets seem to originate from fissures near the south pole.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Porco said calculations eliminated the possibility that the particles were produced by warm vapor rising off warm ice at the surface. The best explanation, she said, is that pockets of liquid water exist under high pressure below a few tens of yards of ice. When the ice ruptures, the water shoots out and immediately freezes into ice crystals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we've got geysers,'' Dr. Porco said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small body like Enceladus would be unlikely to hold enough radioactive elements to produce continuing warmth. A more likely explanation is that the gravitational tugging on Enceladus by Saturn and another moon, Dione, squishes Enceladus and that friction creates the heat. Another mystery is why the heat is concentrated around the south pole.  </p>

If confirmed, this discovery will be the first time any water geyser has been detected outside Earth. It immediately raised the possibility that tiny Enceladus, an enchanting snowy white satellite of Saturn, might harbor the conditions for life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cynics may be tempted to read an unstated political message behind the announcement. Perhaps NASA, under fire for cutting research to finance space shuttle repairs and the president's grandiose exploration program, wanted to show us that it was still doing good science. Or perhaps anxious space scientists, fearing that the budget ax might fall on further unmanned probes, wanted to show us how brilliantly their work was proceeding and what a shame it would be to curtail it.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intentional or not, they surely did that. This latest discovery only adds to the rich lode of knowledge provided by the Cassini spacecraft and other unmanned missions to bodies in the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists were palpably thrilled, with one recently calling it ''the most exciting scientific detective story that I've ever been involved in.'' The Cassini probe dropped down within 109 miles of the tiny moon's surface last year, where its high-resolution instruments produced images of icy jets and towering plumes emerging from a ''hot spot'' (though frigid by our standards) at the moon's south pole, an area that was expected to be much colder. Their best guess, based on modeling studies, is that the jets are erupting from near-surface pockets of water that is above the freezing point, perhaps heated by underground tides or radioactivity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been much speculation over the possibility of life on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, based on surface features and magnetic readings that suggest a liquid ocean beneath the ice. On Enceladus, though no water has been spotted in liquid form, we now have direct observations of water vapor and ice particles venting from sources close to the surface, and models suggesting pressurized pockets of water just below. The notion that primitive life might be found on a tiny, icy moon in what most people would have considered a hostile environment suggests that the search for extraterrestrial life may have to be conducted more broadly.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just after lunch on Thursday, a team of scientists, scriptwriters, directors and producers went to work beneath the stars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here comes the asteroid,'' Carter Emmart, one of the directors, shouted as he gazed into the twinkling lights of a nighttime sky over Manhattan.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's coming in a little too soft,'' Mr. Emmart said to a technical director, tracking the falling asteroid with a red laser dot as he spoke. ''Still too soft. Better. Better. I like it.'' Nearly every day for the past year and a half, Mr. Emmart and his crew have been reviewing and editing portions of a 20-minute space show, ''Cosmic Collisions,'' which opens to the public on March 18 at the Hayden Planetarium. The show uses a digital video system that projects celestial images across the 67-foot-wide hemispheric dome of the planetarium.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is a $3 million production by NASA and the American Museum of Natural History, where Mr. Emmart is the director of astrovisualization at the Rose Center for Earth and Space. Narrated by Robert Redford, the show provides a bold and colorful look at the universe -- with colliding stars, planets and even galaxies -- based on theories and data collected from 30 scientists around the world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There can't be anything wrong, factually or visually, with anything about this presentation,'' said Michael Shara, curator of astrophysics at the museum. ''It has to be consistent with what is being written in the science journals.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the show, in a star-studded view from the Adirondack Mountains -- ''Do you like the height of the horizon?'' a technical director asked Mr. Emmart -- a comet that has roamed frigid space for billions of years approaches Earth. As the comet gains speed, bits of rock from its glowing tail begin to peel off and tumble through Earth's atmosphere, creating a meteor shower above North America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Make that a 1.5,'' a producer yells, prompting technicians to sharpen the image. ''I want to see my house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next images take viewers back four and a half billion years, to the time when a young Earth collides with a Mars-sized planet. The crash creates molten debris that remains in Earth's orbit and is drawn together by gravity. In less than a month, shattered pieces pulled back together by gravity become the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't dressed the Moon yet,'' said Mr. Emmart, explaining the plainness of a yellow circle that looked more like a beach ball in a comic strip than the actual Moon. ''We still need to texturize it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another scientific theory depicted involves a more recent time: 65 million years ago. An asteroid between Mars and Jupiter is pulled out of its orbit and becomes a giant fireball that smashes into Earth at the speed of 40,000 miles an hour, wiping out nearly three-quarters of the life on the planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is called the K-T impact,'' said Anthony Braun, the executive producer of the show. The K-T reference concerns the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary geologic periods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the one that wiped out the dinosaurs,'' Mr. Braun said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planning of ''Cosmic Collisions,'' which received most of its content and financing from NASA, began in 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Braun said his staff had met at the museum with a colloquium of scientists who ''have based their theories on simulations run all over the world that are intended to track how these phenomena would behave.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those scientists was Madhulika Guhathakurta, who is involved in a NASA study of the sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium show ''offers a perspective that most ordinary people in this world have not seen before,'' Dr. Guhathakurta said by telephone from NASA headquarters in Washington. The moving images are accompanied by a soundtrack that Mr. Braun said ''underscores the emotions of each of the computer-simulated scenes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admission to the show is $22 for adults, $16.50 for college students with ID and $13 for children. The planetarium is at Central Park West and 81st Street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the presentation focuses on the past, the show includes a preview of what scientists predict will happen in two billion years: a collision between Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, and its nearest neighbor, Andromeda, that will create one vast new galaxy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The two galaxies,'' Mr. Braun said, ''are drifting toward each other right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay tuned.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heads of the space agencies representing the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada met at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to work on a new plan for completing the $100 billion space station.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the meeting, Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said the agency planned 16 more flights of the space shuttle to finish the station by the end of the decade. NASA's three shuttles -- Atlantis, Discovery and Endeavour -- are the only spacecraft large enough to carry major station components.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partner nations also agreed to increase to six the number of space station crew members in 2009. The station has been operating with a two-member crew since the Columbia disaster three years ago grounded the shuttle fleet. The number is to return to three with the next flight of the shuttle, as early as May 10.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space shuttle has flown once since the Columbia accident; the fleet was grounded again after the Discovery's mission in July. In its launching, more foam insulation fell from its external fuel tank than expected. The debris was blamed for fatally damaging the Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said the adjusted sequence for building the station shifted priorities, moving up the completion of the station's platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't like that,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''But confronted with a choice between having high confidence to complete the assembly of the station or utilizing it heavily as we built it and possibly not finishing, we chose the former course.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One component dropped from the shuttle manifest is a Russian solar power platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anatolii Perminov, head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, said his country agreed to draw power from the American-built power system through 2015 in place of its own, and proposed plans to stockpile Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to maintain the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said station construction flights could resume as early as August, if it is determined that the shuttle could be used safely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA now plans to launch Europe's Columbus research segment on the seventh construction flight, said Jean-Jacques Dordain, director general of the European Space Agency, moving it up by one flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keiji Tachikawa, president of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, said the first of three components for the large Japanese Experiment Module is now scheduled one flight earlier in 2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though some components will be dropped and a new assembly schedule has been introduced, Mr. Griffin said the completed station would do what it was originally intended to do. ''It's the same space station,'' he said. ''The end product is very much as we envisioned it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington on Thursday, the House Science Committee held a hearing on NASA's intention to hold down spending on space science for four years to pay $3 billion in added space shuttle expenses. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is the committee chairman, and other members of Congress expressed concern over the loss of research projects and the disruption of project teams.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the hearing, some scientists argued that NASA was sacrificing small space projects valuable for training graduate students and advancing science to sustain some big programs. Others said the United States was risking its leadership in space science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think these assessments are wrong,'' Mr. Griffin said when asked about the testimony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA still has a space science program and spends $5 billion a year on it, he said. The notion that the program was collapsing, he added, was an ''almost hysterical'' reaction.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most highly promoted missions on NASA's scientific agenda would be postponed indefinitely or perhaps even canceled under the agency's new budget, despite its administrator's vow to Congress six months ago that not ''one thin dime'' would be taken from space science to pay for President Bush's plan to send astronauts to the Moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cuts come to $3 billion over the next five years, even as NASA's overall spending grows by 3.2 percent this year, to $16.8 billion.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the casualties in the budget, released last month, are efforts to look for habitable planets and perhaps life elsewhere in the galaxy, an investigation of the dark energy that seems to be ripping the universe apart, bringing a sample of Mars back to Earth and exploring for life under the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa -- as well as numerous smaller programs and individual research projects that astronomers say are the wellsprings of new science and new scientists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, says NASA needs the money to keep the space shuttle fleet aloft, complete the International Space Station and build a new crew exploration vehicle to replace the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That transition has produced an unexpected shortfall of money, but, Mr. Griffin told the House Science Committee last month, to postpone it would be more damaging than to put off some space science projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're delaying some missions,'' he told the committee, ''but we're not abandoning them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, Mary Cleave, NASA's associate administrator for science, said she took Dr. Griffin at his word that the cuts were a one-time event. ''There was no money available anyplace else,'' Dr. Cleave said. ''We took a hit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programs could still be saved if Congress voted to increase the NASA budget. The agency has powerful allies in both parties, and some have expressed alarm at the proposed cuts, which will be discussed today at a hearing of the House Science Committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at a time when fiscal conservatives are placing intense pressure on the Republican Congressional leadership to rein in government spending, programs that were previously considered sacrosanct are now vulnerable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cuts have alarmed and outraged many scientists, who have long feared that NASA will have to cannibalize its science program to carry out the president's vision of human spaceflight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new cuts, they say, will drive young people from the field, ending American domination of space science and perhaps ceding future discoveries to Europe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line: science at NASA is disappearing -- fast,'' said Donald Lamb, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and chairman of a committee on space science for the Association of American Universities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Science Committee, called the new budget ''bad for space science, worse for earth science,'' adding, ''It basically cuts or de-emphasizes every forward-looking, truly futuristic program of the agency to fund operational and development programs to enable us to do what we are already doing or have done before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the new cuts, NASA's expenditures for space and earth science will grow about 1 percent a year from now to 2011, far less than inflation, even as the Bush administration promotes its effort to bolster American competitiveness by doubling the research budgets at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology over the next 10 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and 56 other senators have introduced a bill that would mandate a 10 percent increase per year in NASA's science budget from now through 2013, among other things.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers and planetary researchers say space science has provided NASA's brightest and most inspirational moments in recent years: the landing on Saturn's moon Titan, the exploits of the Mars rovers and the stream of cosmic postcards from the Hubble Space Telescope.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Dr. Griffin's assurances, they say that delaying space missions can be a death sentence if there is not money to continue developing technology and to keep teams together until the mission is ready to fly again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the case, said Charles Beichman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with the Terrestrial Planet Finder missions, which are intended to produce images of Earth-like planets around other stars. They are the culmination of a line of missions devoted to hunting for planets around other stars and investigating if they are habitable or already harbor life, a goal, planetary scientists point out, that is explicitly endorsed in Mr. Bush's space vision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting ready to fire all the people we've built up,'' said Dr. Beichman, who is the project scientist for the second of the two spacecraft missions, once scheduled for about 2020. Once those scientists have found other jobs, he said, they are not likely to come back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I feel bad about is turning away a generation,'' Dr. Beichman said, explaining that planet-finding has been one of the hottest fields in science lately, attracting, in particular, young scientists into astronomy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were the new kid on the block,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the concern among scientists is for the fate of smaller projects like the low-budget spacecraft called Explorers. Designed to provide relatively cheap and fast access to space, they are usually developed and managed by university groups. Dr. Lamb referred to them as ''the crown jewels in NASA's science program.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, one such mission, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, produced exquisite baby pictures of the Big Bang, while another, the Swift satellite, has helped solve a 30-year-old mystery, linking distant explosions called gamma-ray bursts to the formation of black holes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explorers, Dr. Lamb said, are where graduate students and young professors get their first taste of space science. Until recently, about one mission was launched a year, but under the new plan, there will be none from 2009 to 2012. In a letter to Dr. Cleave last fall, 16 present and former Explorer scientists said, ''Such a lengthy suspension would be a devastating blow to the program and the science community.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One author of the letter, Fiona Harrison, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, said she first learned from a news conference that her own Explorer project, an X-ray satellite observatory called NuStar, was being cancelled after several years of development. Dr. Harrison said that she had been invited to reapply in 2008, but that in the meantime she had to tell her graduate student to find another thesis project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Harrison said she was thinking of leaving the country or perhaps even the field of astrophysics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another move last month, NASA reduced this year's budget for individual research projects by 15 percent, retroactive to last fall, taking money from researchers and their institutions that had already begun work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Cleave, the NASA associate administrator for science, acknowledged that she had been deluged with faxes and e-mail messages from scientists alarmed about these developments. She said the agency would be willing to adjust ''the mix'' in favor of more research and analysis, but added that something would have to give.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have my budget. I don't expect relief,'' she said. ''There's no free lunch here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many scientists said the roots of their plight lay in the Bush administration's refusal to ask Congress for enough money to carry out the Moon-Mars program, announced with fanfare two years ago. But others said they were partly to blame as well for pursuing an overly ambitious agenda in the face of cold realities like the Columbia shuttle disaster and concern about the mounting federal deficit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the James Webb Space Telescope -- the designated successor to the Hubble telescope, designed to see back in time and space within a whisper of the Big Bang -- was ranked first on the astronomers' wish list in an influential National Academy of Sciences survey in 2000. But delays and technical problems have almost doubled its cost, to more than $4.5 billion, and postponed its launching by two years, to 2013. Meanwhile, planned repairs to the Hubble telescope will cost some $300 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Webb and Hubble telescopes, the two highest priorities, are included, said John Mather, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and project scientist for the Webb telescope, ''almost everything else that isn't started had to be stopped.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People assume that when Congress votes for something they send extra money,'' Mr. Mather said. ''They don't.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin and his colleagues, the scientists agree, have tough choices to make, but so far, the space scientists say, the choices have been made in a vacuum, without input from the community most affected, namely them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year NASA dismantled a longstanding network of scientific advisory committees, and while a new network is in the works, it is not yet in place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, ''scientists feel very much left out of this process,'' Dr. Beichman said. ''You could have involved the community and said, 'Here's what we have to do.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''In the end, even scientists can be responsible.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Hale, the space shuttle program manager, said NASA engineers and technicians were facing a ''somewhat aggressive schedule'' in trying to finish preparations to launch the shuttle Discovery during the May 10 to May 23 target window.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Mr. Hale and other managers emphasized that they would not rush the flight just to stay on schedule. But they noted that crucial testing and flight preparations remained to be done with little ''contingency time'' left to absorb unexpected delays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Discovery does fly successfully in May, or during the next available launching period, July 1 to July 19, Mr. Hale said, it remains possible to get three flights off this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has plans to fly the shuttle 17 times before the end of the program in 2010, which requires returning to the steady launching rate disrupted by the loss of the Columbia in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest factors affecting when the Discovery flies is its large external fuel tank, which is to arrive on Wednesday from its manufacturing plant in New Orleans. Michael Leinbach, launching director for the mission, said the modified aluminum tank covered with foam insulation was arriving just in time to complete preparations for a May flight, instead of the normal procedure of arriving months before a launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No part of a tank's normal processing and testing will be cut short, Mr. Leinbach said, but there is no contingency time left in its preparation schedule to prevent a launching delay if a major problem arises.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said a major factor determining when the Discovery could fly is completion of wind tunnel tests to confirm if it is safe to fly the fuel tank with sections of insulating foam removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia was doomed by foam tank debris damaging its heat shield.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the Mercury Control Center stands empty and all but abandoned, half hidden by thick Florida vegetation. Its 10-foot-wide NASA emblem, warped by high winds, flaps even in a light breeze. A trash can on the floor of the hollow control room seems to be the only barrier against rain seeping through the crumbling ceiling.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the 45-year-old center may be slated for demolition, one of 12 sites and landmarks that the space agency says it may tear down to save money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Situated on Air Force property, the control center, where NASA directed the flights of unmanned and manned space capsules from 1960 to 1965, is off limits to the public except for some tours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But Mario Busacca, federal preservation officer for NASA at the Kennedy Space Center here, said that as the agency prepared to replace the space shuttle with a safer vehicle and to return astronauts to the Moon, it needed to rid itself of deteriorated or useless sites, the sooner the better. He emphasized, however, that no decision had been made about the Mercury Control.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restoration would be expensive. While fixing the control center roof would cost less than $1 million, about the cost of demolition, returning the building to its original state would shoot the price up to $5 million, said John H. Johnson, a retired colonel who was deputy commander of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and is now director of the Apollo 1 Memorial Foundation, a group dedicated to preserving historic landmarks at the cape.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, Delaware North, a concessionaire that runs the visitors' complex for the space center, borrowed consoles and other equipment to copy the Mercury Control in a room at the complex. The equipment was to have been returned to the old building after the roof had been repaired.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the Mercury Control turned into an empty shell, the most compelling reason for refurbishing its roof evaporated, pushing maintenance work off the priority list. ''During the past five years, nothing has been done,'' Colonel Johnson said. Delaware North representatives declined to comment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the old center molders. In the men's room (still marked ''Gents''), someone has cordoned off the urinals with black-and-yellow plastic strips and masking tape. Flowers have been put into the fixtures; a sign claims that they were last used by the Mercury astronauts and now belong to the ''Smithsonian Institute Air &amp; Space Museum.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think it's a joke, but nobody is taking it down,'' Mr. Busacca said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plight of the Mercury Control Center is stirring mixed emotions on the part of NASA veterans. ''I don't have that kind of a feeling for it, frankly,'' said Christopher C. Kraft, the first flight director for agency and the principal designer of the space center. ''I have a lot of nostalgia for the people that worked there, but not the building.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Johnson of the Apollo foundation called the building ''the original control center'' for America's human spaceflight program, and added: ''Are we going to take the Washington Monument down? If they take Mission Control down, then I might say we don't give a darn about anything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas J. O'Malley, who pressed the button that sent Colonel Glenn into orbit, agreed. ''I think it's terrible,'' he said, adding that the Mercury building embodied a long-gone era.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Back in 1962, a lot of that stuff was done by manual means,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''We didn't have the sophisticated computers we have now. The launch of that Atlas, that was all manual help. You had to trust everybody that was out there working on it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many historic space sites are being preserved by NASA, the Air Force and private organizations, including the two bunkers used to launch the first American satellite in 1958, as well as the astronauts Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom in 1961; a whole Saturn V rocket and part of its launching tower; and a lunar module and an Apollo spacecraft from the ''Men Walk on Moon'' era.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called White Room, used by Apollo astronauts to board their spacecraft, was salvaged by the actor Tom Hanks and used to film scenes for an HBO miniseries, ''From the Earth to the Moon.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other pieces of history have not been so lucky. In late December, this reporter watched as bulldozers crunched heaps of rusty pipes and smashed a few remaining concrete slabs, all that was left of a hangar that held one of two Viking landers that reached Mars in 1976.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A main concern for the space agency is pollution. Decontamination work costs millions. That is why in 2004 the space agency removed the launching tower used for two of its most historic missions, Apollo 8 and Apollo 11, and dispatched it to the blast furnace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An engineering support building and 200 acres of land around it are soaked with a toxic solvent used to clean rocket parts. The site, Launch Complex 34, was used to launch the first Saturn rockets and was the site of America's first space tragedy, the Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts in a training session in 1967. Like Mercury Control, it is on the historic register.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even this place is not being actively preserved, except for some caretaker work by members of the Apollo foundation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sign stenciled on a concrete pillar of the launching pedestal facing the Atlantic reads ''Abandon in Place.'' The sea breeze is accompanied by ocean spray that will continue to take its toll, eroding steel and concrete.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles B. Mars, a retired rocket engineer and a curator of the Space Walk of Fame museum in Titusville, a few miles from the space center, said he sympathized with NASA's financial situation. Although he hates to see the landmarks vanish, Mr. Mars said, ''Sometimes things need to be done.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the structure, a modern Stonehenge, someone has attached a small plaque that reads:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice so others could reach for the stars.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Latin sentence follows: ''Ad astra per aspera'' -- a rough path leads to the stars. And then, ''Godspeed to the crew of Apollo 1.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said Friday that the two-ton robotic craft, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, was near the end of a 310-million-mile journey from Earth that began last Aug. 12 at Cape Canaveral, Fla.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter is to end its seven-month flight from Earth with a critical firing of its main engines on March 10 to slow the craft enough for the gravity of Mars to pull it into orbit. If something goes wrong with the 27-minute engine firing, the craft will zoom past the planet and go on into a useless orbit around the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting into the dangerous portion of the mission,'' James Graf, the project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said at a news conference at the agency's headquarters here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cruise has not been easy,'' Mr. Graf said. ''We've accomplished an awful lot during that, but now we're starting to enter into the realm where we've lost two spacecraft in the last 15 years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter has to slow by 2,200 miles per hour, or about 18 percent, to go into an initial orbit with a high point of 30,000 miles and a low point of 250 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once locked around Mars, the craft will go through a seven-month period of dipping in and out of the atmosphere to drain off energy and slowly lower itself into a working orbit about 200 miles above the surface. Using this aerobraking technique saved more than 1,100 pounds of launching weight, allowing the spacecraft to be flown on a smaller rocket and saving millions of dollars, Mr. Graf said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slipping a spacecraft into Martian orbit is not easy, said Douglas McCuistion, head of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. NASA has only a 65 percent success rate in placing orbiters around Mars, he said at the news conference, compared with more than 80 percent in landing spacecraft on its surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mars is hard,'' he said. ''Mars can be unpredictable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting the newest Mars explorer into orbit will be hair-raising for its controllers, the officials said. About 21 minutes into the deceleration rocket firing, the craft will disappear behind Mars and remain out of contact for half an hour. After it re-emerges from the shadow of the planet, flight controllers will need 30 minutes to analyze its signals to determine whether it achieved orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will be nail-biting time,'' Mr. Graf said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's instruments will stay in hibernation during the months of aerobraking to reach its ideal orbit.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This burst, however, is an oddball. It lasted nearly 2,000 seconds, or about half an hour, 100 times longer than a typical burst, and was much weaker, said John Nousek, a Pennsylvania State astronomer and the director of the Swift mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so early we don't have a clear answer to what it is,'' Dr. Nousek said yesterday. ''What is clear is that it is nearby and associated with supernova.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody will need sunglasses. At maximum light, Dr. Nousek said, the exploding star would probably be about twice as bright as it is now, within reach of professional and large amateur telescopes, but not the unaided eye. Usually the bursts are so far away across the cosmos that the visual light from the actual explosions is never seen, but this one, called GRB 060218, after the date on which it was discovered, is the second closest ever found, practically next door, leaving astronomers with their armada of instruments in an enviable position.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who called the event ''a lot of fun,'' said, ''We have a lot to learn about these super-duper explosions, and it is great to have an agile satellite like Swift working so beautifully.''  </p>

Atlantis's parts will be used by the remaining shuttles, Discovery and Endeavour, until all of them are mothballed in 2010, the official, Wayne Hale, left, the shuttle program manager, told workers at the Kennedy Space Center last week. Atlantis, which began flying in 1985, was chosen for retirement first because it was scheduled for maintenance, a process that could take two years. The shuttle is likely to have four or five more flights to the International Space Station before retirement. NASA has planned 17 more shuttle flights before the program ends. The next-generation vehicles are expected to be ready no later than 2014.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space tourism industry, its millionaire would-be passengers impatiently tapping on their platinum credit cards, just got a little more crowded, with the announcements of a new rocket development company and of plans to build a $265 million spaceport in the United Arab Emirates.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three telecommunications entrepreneurs from Texas have joined with Space Adventures Ltd., the company that sent the first paying passengers to the International Space Station, to develop passenger spacecraft for suborbital flights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vehicles would be designed by a Russian company, and the first ships could be ready before 2008, said one of the entrepreneurs, Hamid Ansari, who with his wife, Anousheh, and brother, Amir, helped finance the Ansari X Prize competition -- the one that resulted in the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space, in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space Adventures announced yesterday that it would build the spaceport in the emirate of Ras al Khaimah with an initial $30 million investment from its government. Eric C. Anderson, president and chief executive of Space Adventures, said Singapore would soon announce spaceport plans of its own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These and other recent developments increase the likelihood that within a few years, nonastronauts who can afford a six-figure ticket will have the chance at a few minutes of weightlessness and black sky.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like there are a lot of people with discretionary money for whom this is an attractive prospect,'' said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''There are people who want cutting-edge experiences not readily available and are willing to pay for them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He compared the experience to an ''upside-down bungee jump.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson, of Space Adventures, said the announcements were a big moment for the industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing a parallel to the commercial aircraft industry, Mr. Anderson said, ''We're setting up the 'Boeing' to build and manufacture these spaceships.'' The 2008 delivery date, if met, could put the Ansari company, Prodea, ahead of Sir Richard Branson's much-publicized efforts to send paying passengers to space through his company, Virgin Galactic, on ships created by Burt Rutan, the designer of SpaceShipOne, the little craft that won the $10 million X Prize.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new venture is being announced at a busy time for the fledgling space tourism industry. This week, New Mexico's legislature authorized $100 million over the next three years to build a spaceport near Las Cruces. The state will become world headquarters for Virgin Galactic, as well as the home of the annual X Prize Cup, an annual rocket event that is to begin this October, featuring races by rocket-powered aircraft in what has been called the Rocket Racing League.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rivalry between Virgin and the new effort will be a healthy one, Mr. Ansari said, because ''the No. 1 reason for success is competition.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian designers, he said, are known for design that is simple, reliable and economical: ''They know the more stuff you have in there, the more potential you have for things to go wrong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A suborbital flight, like the first United States Mercury space flights in the 1960's, would shoot more than 65 miles above the earth and return along a parabolic route. The energies required to reach orbit, and the risks of re-entering the atmosphere, involve far greater technical challenges.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Branson commissioned Mr. Rutan to develop a new vehicle, SpaceShipTwo, for Virgin Galactic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal technology export restrictions, however, could keep the spacecraft designed by Mr. Rutan from being used outside of the United States. And that creates an opportunity for the Russian-designed craft, said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis, a founder of the X Prize Foundation and a creator of several space-related businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the competition was the sign of a real industry aborning. ''I think we are entering a new era of personal space flight,'' he said. ''Competition drives reliability up and price down.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Whitehorn, the president of Virgin Galactic, said that 157 people had put down deposits totaling $12.2 million to fly in Mr. Rutan's craft, which should be in test flights by the end of next year and could be flying commercially by late 2008.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that he was confident that his company's efforts would be successful despite the new entrants and any possible restrictions on selling the vehicles outside the United States.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The best place to start a business like this is the United States because that's where three-quarters of the customers are at the moment,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of his new competitors, he said, ''I wish them luck.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Technically, there's a whole bunch of things going on, and all that has to line up,'' the commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, said in an interview after the astronauts' news conference at the Kennedy Space Center. ''We are scheduled for early May, and we're still holding to that schedule.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, by the shuttle Discovery, will be the second since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven in February 2003. That disaster was caused by a 1.67-pound piece of insulating foam that broke off the external fuel tank at liftoff and punched a hole in the left wing, causing the shuttle to disintegrate when it re-entered the atmosphere 16 days later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, the shuttle program resumed with a 14-day mission by the Discovery to the International Space Station. But despite two years of efforts to repair the foam problem, another piece broke away from a ramp on the fuel tank about two minutes after liftoff. The fleet was again grounded after the Discovery returned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency has decided to remove foam from that area of the tank and has conducted aerodynamic tests to make sure it can be done without additional risk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey, 45, will be on his fourth shuttle mission and his second as commander. In the interview, he said some loss of foam was inevitable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The program has never advertised that we'll never lose any foam,'' he said. ''And we'll lose foam on this flight just like every other. The key is to make sure the foam we do lose is small enough in size that it can't hurt us if it hits the vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to carrying badly needed supplies to the space station and dropping off a European astronaut, the mission includes three spacewalks, with one to test repair techniques on the shuttle's heat-protection tiles and the leading edges of the wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the news conference, the astronauts said they felt more than ready to go, but would take it in stride if the mission had to be delayed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's frustrating to see delays in the program, but obviously we want to fly as safely as possible,'' the pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, said. ''Having said that, it's still really good to be at the front of the line instead of the back of the line, where we'll be as soon as we land from this flight.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other astronauts at the news conference were Michael E. Fossum, Cmdr. Lisa M. Nowak of the Navy, Piers J. Sellers and Stephanie D. Wilson. Thomas Reiter of Germany, representing the European Space Agency, was not present.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawmakers were responding to a cascade of reports about efforts by political appointees in the space agency's press office to restrict interviews or alter news releases that might conflict with Bush administration policies on pollution, global warming and other issues.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a House Science Committee hearing on the agency's $16.8 billion budget request for the next fiscal year, the chairman, Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, said that while NASA had responded well so far, it ''still has a lot of work to do to ensure openness.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, said he was eager to see Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, follow through on a pledge he made to the agency's 19,000 employees on Feb. 3 to review its communications policies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm afraid that scientific censorship permeates this administration, and NASA is no exception,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''But the administrator is taking a forthright role.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the hearing, Dr. Griffin told reporters that ''certain individuals have done things they shouldn't have'' but that he doubted there was a widespread practice of muzzling NASA scientists or misrepresenting science.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that agency employees needed to feel free to speak out and that NASA was particularly concerned about openness because in the wake of the space shuttle disasters of 1986 and 2003, ''people said certain views'' had not been listened to beforehand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin said his review should be completed, and a new policy put in place, ''in the next few weeks.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two efforts aimed at change are under way. Shana Dale, the deputy administrator, established a group of 12 NASA scientists, administrators and public affairs employees on Wednesday to recommend provisions of a policy to replace the existing one, which dates from 1987 and is largely unknown within the agency. And other senior administrators, several officials said, are reviewing reports of communications trouble that are flowing from NASA's research centers around the nation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Franco Einaudi, director of the Earth-Sun Exploration Division at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said some of the problems reported by scientists or staff members were simply cases of public affairs officers' getting the science wrong.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Communication needs a lot of cooperation,'' Dr. Einaudi said. ''Generally scientists don't know how to write and public affairs people don't know the science.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in some cases, he said, changes have been made in which ''it is clear that the motivation is not just to make the English better.'' He declined to discuss those incidents because the review had just begun.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, David R. Mould, the assistant administrator for public affairs, defended the agency's handling of news releases and the media, saying his goal was to keep it free of spin of any sort.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't want anyone's political agenda to be associated with NASA publications,'' Mr. Mould said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many NASA scientists and public affairs workers have said they have felt far more influence on the flow of information than their predecessors did during the Clinton administration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul C. Light, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, who is an expert on political appointees, said the issues surfacing at NASA were a result of a general ballooning of political influence in government public affairs offices over the last decade, ''with a particular acceleration under Bush.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The units are focusing heavily on editing, spinning, doctoring just about anything that leaves their agencies via reports, interviews, Congressional testimony,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Robert E. Moffitt of the Heritage Foundation, co-author of a 2001 paper that called on the Bush administration to increase political appointments in influential offices within government agencies, said public affairs offices were ideal places for people hired to promote an administration's worldview.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Better to have them in a public affairs office, where they can speak for the president, than, for example, servicing the space shuttle,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James E. Hansen, the NASA climate scientist who was the first to complain of restrictions on his speaking and news media contacts, said that Dr. Griffin's recent statements were encouraging but that the political appointees at headquarters might not yet have gotten the message.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The administrator has it exactly right,'' Dr. Hansen said. ''We live in a free country and work for the taxpayer. We should provide useful information, not propaganda. But based on their recent remarks, public affairs still doesn't get it.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Press officers, who were granted anonymity because they said they were still concerned for their jobs despite Dr. Griffin's call for openness, said much of the pressure in late 2004 was placed on Gretchen Cook-Anderson. At the time, Ms. Cook-Anderson was in charge of managing the flow of earth science news at NASA headquarters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call with colleagues in October 2004, the colleagues said, she said that Glenn Mahone, then the assistant administrator for public affairs, had told her that a planned news conference on fresh readings by a new NASA satellite, Aura, that measures ozone and air pollution, should not take place until after the election.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message yesterday, Ms. Cook-Anderson, who now works as a writer and editor for NASA through a contractor, said, ''While I can't discuss these matters, I won't disagree with that description of what took place.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahone has since left NASA. He did not return several calls seeking comment yesterday. Dean Acosta, a political appointee who was then Mr. Mahone's deputy and is now Dr. Griffin's press secretary, said he had never pressed Ms. Cook-Anderson to cut back on news releases. ''I was not part of any meeting that would have been party to that,'' Mr. Acosta said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But archives of news releases on the NASA headquarters Web site show a sharp change in the number of such releases, to 12 in 2005 from about four dozen in 2004, a figure that had helped lead to the pressure to cut back. (The figures do not count routine announcements of events like satellite launchings.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin announced the review of communications policies after complaints last month by James E. Hansen, the agency's top climate scientist, that political appointees were trying to stop him from speaking out on global warming. After those complaints were reported in The Times, other scientists and press officers came forward with similar stories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a more recent example of possible political pressure at the agency, press officers and scientists cited an e-mail message sent last July from NASA's headquarters to its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. It said a Web presentation describing the uncontroversial finding that Earth was a ''warming planet'' could not use the phrase ''global warming.'' It is ''standard practice,'' the message went on, to use the phrase ''climate change.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the intent was to use the most general term to describe climate fluctuations. But other public affairs workers and some scientists at the agency called it an effort to avoid mentioning that global temperatures are rising.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The e-mail message was written by Erica Hupp, a civil servant at headquarters. She did not reply to several requests for comment, but several people who work with her, and others who preceded her in managing earth-science news in the office, said this was a standing unwritten order from political appointees in public affairs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was this general understanding that when something in this field was written about that it was to be described as climate change and not global warming,'' said Elvia H. Thompson, who recently retired from the same office.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some efforts to delay or alter news releases on earth science involving the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were reported last fall by Rosemary Sullivant, a writer working for NASA, to an ethics group at the laboratory and to David Baltimore, the president of the California Institute of Technology, which manages the laboratory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sullivant declined to discuss the matter, but yesterday, Charles Elachi, the director of the laboratory, said he and Dr. Baltimore had conferred about the complaints and determined that while such activities had occurred, there was no evidence they were still going on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Elachi added that he had told public affairs officials at the laboratory that he wanted to know immediately about any future efforts to influence the tenor of science findings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will contact headquarters and tell them that that will be an issue,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent accusations of political interference appear to reflect an intensifying debate between a small but influential cluster of presidential appointees at NASA headquarters and longtime civil servants and career scientists dispersed at space agency research hubs around the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The issue is where does science end and policy begin,'' said David Goldston, chief of staff to Representative Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subject is likely to come up today at a NASA budget hearing before the Science Committee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A central point of division within NASA is how much ''openness'' is appropriate when such expressions conflict with administration policy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday, in comments at the National Space Club in Washington, Dr. Griffin said the agency must ensure that its scientists can speak freely on the implications of their work for policy -- as long as they do not imply they are representing NASA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answering a question, he described a divide within the agency between those seeking ''to enforce a line between what's true and what to do about what's true'' and experts at NASA with strong personal views.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some folks don't wish to observe that line,'' he said, according to a transcript provided by a NASA official. ''And if they don't, as long as people speak as private citizens, my attitude is, let me hold your coat for you. You can get into that fray and get beat up. You just can't label it as an agency position.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David R. Mould, NASA's assistant administrator for public affairs and a political appointee, said none of the appointees had brought a political agenda to the agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've received no marching orders from anyone,'' Mr. Mould said.   </p>

The request would reduce spending on the troubled shuttle program to $4.06 billion in the 2007 fiscal year, from $4.78 billion for 2006, while spending on the station would increase 3 percent, to $1.81 billion, in anticipation of resuming construction on it after a three-year hiatus because of the destruction of the shuttle Columbia.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin had earlier promised that he would ''not take one thin dime'' from space science to pay for human spaceflight programs, including President Bush's exploration plan to send humans back to the Moon and later to Mars.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit, stuffed with old clothes and a radio transmitter, orbited Earth twice on Friday, giving off faint signals to Japan. But then the suit, named Ivan Ivanovich, apparently went silent.  </p>

''It may have ceased operating very shortly after its deployment.'' Mr. Navias speculated that the suit's batteries may have become too cold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit was released Friday afternoon, looking like a cosmonaut tumbling helplessly through space. The transmitter was to send recorded messages in six languages to amateur radio operators for several days before eventually re-entering Earth's atmosphere and burning up, NASA officials said. It even wore a helmet and gloves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, known as SuitSat-1, was the brainchild of a Russian ham radio operator. The suit was supposed to send several words in code for schoolchildren listening on the ground. Radio operators were supposed to pick up the messages by tuning in to an FM frequency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the transmitter, the suit also had internal sensors to monitor temperature and battery power; readings of these measurements were also to have been transmitted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deployment of the suit came at the start of a five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to perform maintenance and photography by William S. McArthur Jr. of the United States, the commander, and Col. Valery I. Tokarev of the Russian Air Force, the flight engineer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their most difficult chore involved taking steps to protect an important cable connected to a transporter that moves a platform holding the station's robotic arm. A twin cable was inadvertently cut in December. Mission managers wanted to make sure that did not happen to the remaining cable by having Mr. McArthur insert a bolt into a cable cutter device.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. McArthur had trouble tightening the bolt, so Colonel Tokarev instead tied the cable with a wire to a handrail out of the way of the cable cutter device. The cut cable will be repaired later.  </p>

The object, nicknamed Xena for now, is about 1,900 miles wide, or a third wider than Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if Pluto is the ninth planet in the solar system and Xena, which also orbits the Sun, is bigger, that makes 10 planets, right?  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, some astronomers say. But others argue that Xena is not a true planet, and neither, for that matter is Pluto. Both are objects from the Kuiper Belt, a ring of orbiting icy debris beyond Neptune. So, these astronomers say, there are really only eight planets in the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, ''How many planets are there in the solar system?'' has become a trick question.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will probably become even trickier. For there are more Pluto-or-larger objects remaining to be found in the outer solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who discovered Xena, is halfway through a systematic sweep of the sky that can detect planets out to a distance of 10 billion miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In half of the sky,'' Dr. Brown said, ''we've found one that's larger than Pluto, one that is Pluto and two almost the size of Pluto.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects to find a similar yield in the other half of the sky. Thus, he expects perhaps none, perhaps one, perhaps a few more objects bigger than Pluto. ''Probably not five,'' he said. ''Definitely not 10.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, future searches that look out farther could turn up even more. One of Dr. Brown's earlier discoveries was Sedna, an object smaller than Pluto but with a highly elliptical orbit. Sedna swings out as far as 84 billion miles. The only reason Dr. Brown found it was that it is currently near its closest point to the Sun, a mere 8.4 billion miles away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since his search could have discovered Sedna only along about one-60th of its orbit, he estimates there are probably 60-some Sednas out there. And since some of them will be larger than Sedna, it might not be unreasonable that some would be considerably larger -- perhaps as large as Mercury or Mars, or maybe even Earth. KENNETH CHANG  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the discovery of 2003 UB313 was announced in July 2005, astronomers knew that it was almost certainly larger than Pluto, because it appears surprisingly bright in the sky, even though it is nine billion miles from the Sun, or about three times as far as Pluto. Even if it had a perfectly reflective surface, 2003 UB313 would have to have the surface area of Pluto to achieve that brightness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the surface turned out to be dark, reflecting only a small fraction of sunlight, 2003 UB313 could conceivably have been the size of Mercury, the next in size with a diameter of 3,000 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine how large the object is, Dr. Bertoldi and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy measured the heat emanating from it. That enabled them to calculate a surface temperature of about minus-418 degrees Fahrenheit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with the previous optical observations, the data led to the finding that 2003 UB313 reflects about 60 percent of the light that hits it, similar to Pluto. That, in turn, allowed the scientists to calculate the diameter at 1,860 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The similarities between 2003 UB313 and Pluto extend beyond size and reflectivity. Like Pluto, 2003 UB313 also has a moon and has methane ice on its surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of 2003 UB313 has intensified a debate over the definition of a planet, which has swirled about Pluto since the late 1990's. Pluto is by far the smallest of the nine planets, and 2003 UB313, while larger than Pluto, is still smaller than Earth's moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to one definition, a planet has to gravitationally dominate its surroundings. That would exclude both Pluto and 2003 UB313.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers contend that any object in the solar system large enough that gravity has shaped it into a sphere should be called a planet. But that would also add quite a few asteroids and other Kuiper Belt objects. Another possibility is to arbitrarily call anything larger than Pluto a planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate has kept astronomers from bestowing a formal, more memorable name for 2003 UB313. If planet status is bestowed, 2003 UB313 will probably be named after a Roman or Greek deity, like the other planets except Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is still a stalemate on the meaning of 'planet,' '' said Brian G. Marsden, director of the Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union, ''and no progress on providing a name for 2003 UB313.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''10th Planet?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have determined the size of the planetary body 2003 UB313.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mrs. Rodgers spoke, an unidentified man in the crowd of nearly 400 people shouted, ''God bless you!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the ceremony, held at the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center, NASA also took the opportunity to recognize the other 17 astronauts who have been killed since human spaceflight began in 1961.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those in attendance were family members of other Challenger astronauts and relatives of the seven astronauts who died on Feb. 1, 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia broke apart as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also present was the brother of Virgil I. Grissom, the Apollo 1 commander, who died in a fire along with two colleagues in a launchpad training session aboard the spacecraft in 1967.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said the other seven astronauts honored on Saturday all died in aircraft crashes during training missions.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers say that by virtue of the ceaseless shifting of the billions of stars in the Milky Way and a trick of Einsteinian physics, they have briefly glimpsed the most Earth-like planet yet to be discovered outside the solar system. It is a ball of rock and ice only about 5.5 times as massive as Earth, smaller than any of the 160 previously discovered exoplanets, and is orbiting a dim reddish star 21,000 light-years from here.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery, the researchers say, suggests that rock-ice planets like our own are predominant in the cosmos. That bodes well for future planet-hunting missions from space like the Terrestrial Planet Finders at NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distant planet manifested itself as a brief flash: As it passed at night in front of an even more distant star, its gravity focused and momentarily brightened the star's light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was all over in less than a day, a cosmic blink of an eye.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the blip in the night that we have been waiting for,'' said Jean-Philippe Beaulieu of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, who led an international collaboration of 73 astronomers. They reported their findings yesterday at a news conference in Washington and are publishing them today in the journal Nature.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan P. Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said in an e-mail message that the discovery was ''a big one.'' Another expert who took no part in the research, Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, said, ''The result looks solid to me, and perhaps the planet is, too.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, smaller than Neptune and dubbed OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, resides about 234 million miles from its star. At that distance, its surface temperature would be minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Beaulieu said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was largely that of two large teams that have built far-flung observing networks to exploit a feature of Einstein's general theory of relativity. The theory says a massive object can act as a gravitational lens, bending and magnifying the light from more distant objects in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One team, the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, led by Andrzej Udalski of Warsaw University, has been set up to monitor the brightness of millions of Milky Way stars every night from a telescope in Chile, so as to catch fluctuations caused by the passage of intervening objects of various kinds: dim stars, so-called dark matter objects or planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, alerted by the OGLE team that such a lensing event was under way, Dr. Beaulieu's team, Planet (for Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork), sprang into action to do high-resolution observations. On Aug. 9, that team recorded a tiny blip on a much larger blip that was caused by the passage of an unseen star, the planet's parent, in front of the more distant star. That tiny blip was the planet itself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Beaulieu explained in an e-mail message, it would have been much easier to see a giant gaseous type of planet. The long odds against detecting so small a planet as the new one argues for its commonness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If only a small fraction of the stars had such planets, we would have never detected this small planet,'' Dr. Beaulieu said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Tremaine, a theorist at Princeton, said, ''The results suggest that rock-ice planets must be more common than gas giants.''  </p>

Each in its own tragic way represents a pivotal moment in space exploration. The two most recent disasters continue to haunt the program with lost momentum and persistent doubts about its value and future direction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-nine years ago, on Jan. 27, 1967, the three astronauts of Apollo 1 lost their lives in a fire on the launching pad. The training accident set back the successful attainment of the goal to land men on the Moon by the end of the decade, but did not prevent it.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, on Jan. 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing all on board, including a schoolteacher. The disaster was all the more stunning because it occurred in full view of the crowds at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and of millions watching on television. It was more than two and a half years before another shuttle flew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, on Feb. 1, 2003, the shuttle Columbia broke apart over Texas on its return from orbit, killing the seven astronauts. It was again two and a half years before a shuttle returned to orbit, and it encountered a potentially disastrous problem. Although the mission was completed safely, flights were again suspended, and are not expected to resume earlier than May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference last week at Cape Canaveral, Fla., Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, acknowledged that ''this is a time to think about those kinds of losses.'' He compared those experiences ''surrounded by black crepe'' with the many setbacks in the early days of air transportation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that is the perspective with which we have to look at our losses in spaceflight,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''We are, as fallible and flawed human beings, trying very hard to learn how to do something very, very difficult to do.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts outside the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say the program of human spaceflight has never really recovered from the Challenger disaster. Even before 1986, the shuttles had failed to live up to expectations as reliable and cost-effective reusable vehicles for carrying crews and cargo into orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The shuttle could never do what the agency tried to make it do, and so they traded off safety,'' said Alex Roland, a former NASA historian who is a professor of history at Duke University. ''I don't blame the managers; they were presented with an impossible job.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immediate flaw in the booster rockets that ignited the Challenger explosion was fixed, Dr. Roland and other critics say, but not the systemic engineering and management shortcomings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The proof is the Columbia accident,'' Dr. Roland said, noting that engineers had had warnings on prior flights of the fuel tank debris that damaged the shuttle wing and led to the craft's fatal disintegration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was enormous pressure on the managers and they just kept flying with the problem, even though they could not explain why it was happening,'' he said. ''The law of averages caught up on Columbia.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said human spaceflight had never recovered from the decision to build the program around the shuttles and then the International Space Station, the orbiting platform assembled and maintained mainly by shuttles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA is attempting now to recover from 35 years that in many ways were a dead end,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''That was not NASA's mistake, but the country's, the national leadership's.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took two disasters -- the Challenger and then the Columbia -- to shock the White House and Congress into trying to redirect the program, Dr. Logsdon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the Bush administration announced an ambitious ''vision of space exploration'' plan to phase out the shuttles by 2010, while developing more reliable replacement vehicles based on the latest technology. The stated goal is to have them ready by 2012. Their main purpose is to return people to the Moon and, eventually, to take them to Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon said he was cautiously optimistic. ''All along, we should have been exploring and continuing the momentum of Apollo,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Roland and other critics are skeptical. ''The announcement was a piece of election year rhetoric,'' he said. ''It's not going to happen, not the way it has started. All the big money for the program will have to come after Bush leaves office.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But advisers close to Dr. Griffin and a former agency official say the NASA administrator believes that the shuttle is a dangerous vehicle and is committed to finding a replacement and a new mission. After the Challenger, they recalled, there was no such new vision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the anniversaries of past setbacks, Dr. Griffin said, ''It's a tough job, and the losses that we have sustained so far reflect the difficulty of the challenge and our limitations as human beings as we try to invent a new technology.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- It may be a little early, at 9 a.m., to hear a motivational speaker. Any motivational speaker. A certain bleariness sits over this crowd of about 50 financial and insurance conference planners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their attention sharpens as a video screen shows a space shuttle preparing to launch and a thin, reedy voice begins to describe what the takeoff feels like -- from the inside.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 15 seconds before launch, Col. R. Michael Mullane tells them, ''Our hearts are pounding, deep adrenal surges.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He continues: ''T-minus 9 8 7 6 -- main engines start. We hear nothing of the remaining count. The cockpit is violently wrenched as Atlantis' three liquid engines explode to life. The instruments blur with the vibration.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as the two solid rocket boosters ignite, putting more than seven million pounds of thrust at the astronauts' backs, he says, ''We're slapped in our seats with the force of two gravities as Atlantis leaps from the Earth.'' No one seems sleepy any more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motivational speakers usually deliver platitudes that resemble the inspirational posters advertised in airline magazines. But Colonel Mullane, who retired from the astronaut corps in 1990 after three trips on the shuttle, has a different goal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his talks and in a new book, ''Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut,'' he says he is trying to take the lessons he learned in a life of flight -- including the harsh lessons of NASA's deadly mistakes -- and distill them into something that people can apply in their terrestrial lives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he speaks of the importance of teamwork, he describes the rigors of preparing for a mission for months or years. When he talks of the importance of having the courage to speak up, he need only recount the time when, as a weapons and navigational systems operator on a fighter jet, he failed to challenge a pilot who continued to fly after ''Bingo fuel,'' the point beyond which a plane may not have enough fuel to return safely to base.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the ''little voice in the back of my brain'' that told him to say something, Colonel Mullane tells the audience, he was reluctant to second-guess the pilot, who had thousands of hours of experience in the jet, and passively accepted the pilot's decision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically at that critical moment of the flight, I ceased to be a team member and became a passenger,'' he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They ended up running out of fuel and ejected just short of the landing strip. The F-111 became a $20 million pile of rubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At NASA, too, Colonel Mullane tells audiences, little voices went unheard; danger signals were missed and warnings ignored on the way to tragedies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA designed the shuttle with no escape system -- an example of fatal hubris, Colonel Mullane said, after the successes of Apollo. Worries that flames from within the solid rocket boosters might burn through safety seals known as O-rings were played down, and seven astronauts died in the Challenger disaster 20 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recurring incidents of insulating foam's falling from the shuttle's external fuel tank and hitting the delicate shuttle orbiter were treated as maintenance issues, even though the problem had been recognized as potentially fatal. On Feb. 1, 2003, the shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry because of impact with foam during launching, and its crew of seven astronauts died.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts were ignorant of some of the risks and ignored others in their passion to reach space, he writes in the book. Management at NASA, he wrote, was secretive about astronaut assignments, turning the corps into an emotional pressure cooker with no room for dissent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The line into space was long and nobody wanted to be at its end, or worse, be banished from it altogether,'' Colonel Mullane writes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar criticisms of the space agency have been laid out in a shelf of reports, including the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, which said that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had a ''broken safety culture.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few insiders have been openly critical of the agency, and critics who are astronauts have been even rarer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question ''What next?'' is one that has confronted generations of retiring astronauts. Many find berths in academia or in the world of business. One, Dan Barry, will be part of the next cast of the CBS reality show ''Survivor.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Mullane, who concedes that ''anything an astronaut does after NASA is mundane,'' travels the country, speaking about 50 times a year at $10,000 per appearance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He delivers his talks in business attire -- slacks, a blazer, tie and a well-starched shirt. For years, he wore his blue astronaut jumpsuit, he said, but at 60, ''I look like one of those geezers on 'Space Cowboys.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic structure of his speech stays the same, a combination of anecdote and exhortation (''It's going to be on the wings of great teamwork and great leadership that great things happen,'' ''Courageous self leaders challenge themselves in the extreme.''), sprinkled with references to semiconductors or perfume or nuclear power plants or whatever field of work his audience is engaged in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you can do this, folks, you are going to take your teams to the highest achievement orbit -- of sales success, safety efficiency, profit -- taking your crew to new levels,'' he tells the crowd. ''I wish you godspeed on that journey.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one seems to mind that the references to sales and profit do not really apply to conference planning, the occupation of most of the audience members. Colonel Mullane's underlying message, said Steve Bova, the executive director of Financial and Insurance Conference Planners, whose Northeast chapter invited the astronaut to speak, ''had a lot of takeaways to our business,'' so ''even with the miss, he hit a home run.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Mullane grew up in Albuquerque, his father a flight engineer who lost the use of his legs to polio when Mike Mullane was 9. His parents, he said, indulged his bottomless curiosity about space, allowing him to build rockets at home and cook fuel in the kitchen, in retrospect a horrifyingly dangerous hobby. He fired the rockets -- basically pipe bombs, he said, open at one end -- in the desert, or sometimes off the roof of the house. The experiments, as often as not, ended with spectacular explosions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most dangerous period in a male's life isn't doing anything as an adult,'' he tells audiences. ''It's being a teenage boy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-deprecating humor fills Colonel Mullane's talks and his book, some of it unprintable here. He describes the challenges of going to the bathroom in a zero-gravity environment in squirming detail. The bathroom is separated from the crew's cabin by only a curtain. The shuttle toilet, which uses a vacuum seal and air jets, is inevitably messy. The suction funnel for collecting urine makes a loud slurping noise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the book, Colonel Mullane explains -- but does not try to excuse -- the behavior of the men who were military fliers in the astronaut corps toward their female counterparts. Women may be from Venus and men from Mars, he wrote, but military fliers are from the planet 'Planet A.D.,' for Arrested Development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spares himself no embarrassment, recounting an evening when he approached the astronauts Sally Ride and Steven Hawley at a restaurant as they dined with another woman. ''I walked over and said, 'Hey, Stevie, are you getting cookie recipes from these girls?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other woman, as it happened, was Jane Pauley, whom, he said, he did not recognize because ''she wasn't in Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, he said, ''Testosterone is neurotoxic.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert L. Gibson, nicknamed Hoot, who flew five shuttle missions, four as commander, and who read a manuscript of Colonel Mullane's book before publication, said, ''A lot of this stuff has never seen the light of day before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the glories of space flight, Colonel Mullane's career in space was one of relative obscurity. He was upstaged by the others in his NASA class: six women, including Dr. Ride, who would be the first American woman in space and three African-Americans, including Guion Bluford, who would be the first African-American in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could have mooned the press corps and I would not have been noticed,'' he recalled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of his three flights were military missions that involved deploying satellites. He cannot reveal what the satellites do, and the medal of intelligence he received for his first mission was classified. For many years, he was not allowed to take it out of the vault at NASA, although he was told that he could come back and put it on any time he was in the area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The medal was later unclassified, but the nature of the equipment is still secret.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the anonymity and secrecy, Colonel Mullane found that reaching orbit does not release you from mundane problems. His son Patrick, a technology executive who attended the talk in Providence, recounted the story of a family trip to Galveston, Tex., the resort town just down the road from their home in Clear Lake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family walked into Gaido's, a large seafood restaurant looking out over the Gulf of Mexico, Patrick Mullane recalled. But after they sat down, his father opened his menu and quickly realized that the prices were well out of range of his military salary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He ordered two baked potatoes for the five of us,'' Patrick recalled. The family ate, paid and left hungry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is one message that Colonel Mullane says he wants to get across, it is that space travel can be made safer. The designers of the shuttle were drunk with the success of Apollo missions, he said, adding, ''These guys thought they were gods.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They subjected the shuttle astronauts to unnecessary risks, and those risks will remain as long as the shuttle continues to fly, he argues.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to think that anybody who reads my book in the future knows that there are no gods,'' he said. ''The laws of physics don't remember that you landed on the Moon.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stardust mission to bring back samples of comet and interstellar dust was more successful than they had hoped, scientists said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 100-pound sample container from the seven-year mission, which landed on the salt flats of Utah on Sunday, captured thousands of particles, perhaps even a million, that originated at the edge of the solar system or from distant stars, they said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they had expected mostly microscopic samples, the researchers said, a surprising number of the particles were large enough to be seen with the naked eye.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It exceeded all of our grandest expectations,'' Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington said in a televised news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the samples were taken for study.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo in the Stardust's sample container, which was opened Tuesday, ''was an ancient cosmic treasure from the very edge of the solar system,'' Dr. Brownlee said. Scientists believe that these particles are the pristine remains of the material that formed the planets and other bodies some 4.6 billion years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft flew with a 14-inch-wide collector that resembled a tennis racket and was filled with aerogel, a silicon material composed of 99.8 percent air. The aerogel gently slowed and trapped particles without significantly damaging them. When the particles hit the aerogel, they left tracks in the material.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Stardust returned from its 2.9-billion-mile trek around the inner solar system, which included a close encounter with the comet Wild 2 near Jupiter on Jan. 2, 2004, Dr. Brownlee cautioned fellow researchers not to be disappointed if they did not see evidence of the particles with the naked eye, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prediction was that we would get a dozen particles larger than human hair size and one particle a little bit larger than a millimeter,'' Dr. Brownlee said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were totally overwhelmed by the ability to actually see this stuff so straightforwardly,'' he said. ''Just looking at it, you can see hundreds and hundreds of tracks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one of the tracks is large enough to insert a small finger, he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brownlee said some of the tracks in the aerogel might have been left by ice particles that later evaporated. If such cavities are found, he said, they may contain residue of the ice and its constituents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If a sample hit the aerogel, it's still there in some form,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its journey, the Stardust also spent 195 days collecting particles flowing through the solar system from stars far out in space. Scientists said there appeared to be hundreds of samples of these particles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brownlee said the $212 million cost of the 10-year Stardust project was a bargain considering the amount of knowledge it should provide about the origins of the solar system and Earth. ''The way I like to look at it,'' he said with a laugh, ''it's the same cost as a well-paid baseball player over a 10-year period.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA launched the first space mission to Pluto yesterday as a powerful rocket hurled the New Horizons spacecraft on a nine-year, three-billion-mile journey to the edge of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it soared toward a 2007 rendezvous with Jupiter, whose powerful gravitational field will slingshot it on its way to Pluto, mission managers said radio communications confirmed that the 1,054-pound craft was in good health.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $700 million mission began when a Lockheed Martin Atlas 5 rocket rose from a launching pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 2 p.m., almost an hour later than planned because of low clouds that obscured a clear view of the flight path by tracking cameras.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have ignition and liftoff of NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on a decadelong voyage to visit the planet Pluto and then beyond,'' declared Bruce Buckingham, NASA's launching commentator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than an hour later, all three stages of the booster rocket worked as planned, and the spacecraft separated from them and sprinted away toward deep space. The robot ship sped away at about 36,000 miles per hour, the fastest flight of any spacecraft sent from Earth, allowing it to pass the Moon in about nine hours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a historic day,'' said Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the mission's principal scientist and team leader.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Dr. Stern said the timing assured that the New Horizons would arrive for its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015 -- the 50th anniversary of the first flyby of Mars by the Mariner 4, the mission that began the exploration of the planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's liftoff also paid homage to Pluto's discoverer, the astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh, who in 1930 became the only American to find a planet in the solar system. (He died at 90, in 1997.) His widow, Patricia Tombaugh, 93, and other family members were present at the cape, and some of his remains were among the commemorative items aboard the spacecraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of Clyde's ashes are on their way to Pluto today,'' Dr. Stern said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons is to reach Jupiter's gravitational field in 13 months. The trip to Pluto will take eight more years, most of which the craft will spend in electronic ''hibernation'' to save power and wear on the equipment needed for its seven experiments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons is powered by a small plutonium-fired electric generator. Its instruments include three cameras, for visible-light, infrared and ultraviolet images, and three spectrometers to study the composition and temperatures of Pluto's thin atmosphere and surface features.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also carries a University of Colorado dust counter, the first experiment to fly on a planetary mission that is entirely designed and operated by students. This is the only experiment that will not hibernate during the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the two-hour delay, the launching was postponed twice in two days -- on Tuesday by strong winds at the cape and on Wednesday by a storm that caused a power failure at the spacecraft's control center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Mission planners had until Feb. 14 to launch the mission this year, but only until the end of this month to use the gravity boost from Jupiter, which will shorten the trip to Pluto by five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once near its target, the New Horizons is to conduct about five months of studies, including a closest-approach dash that takes it within 6,200 miles of Pluto's surface and 16,800 miles from the planet's large moon, Charon. The craft will also study two smaller moons found late last year by the Hubble Space Telescope and any new features discovered while it is on its way, scientists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is to continue past Pluto, possibly visiting large objects in the Kuiper Belt, an outer zone of the solar system that includes Pluto. The belt is made up of thousands of icy, rocky objects that include comets and small planets. Scientists believe that this material is left over from the creation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago and that studying it will provide clues to how the Sun and planets formed.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft that could be a time capsule carrying the history of the solar system made a predawn landing in a muddy Utah desert yesterday, completing a seven-year journey of almost three billion miles with a fiery, pinpoint descent to Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, a 100-pound sample container jettisoned from the Stardust explorer and bearing comet and star dust, landed at the Utah Test and Training Range of the Air Force, southwest of Salt Lake City, at 5:10 a.m. Eastern time after the sequential deployment of its two parachutes.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no initial indication that a small stabilizing chute had deployed after the container's flaming re-entry into the atmosphere, causing a few tense moments among the scientists and engineers awaiting the Stardust's return in the landing area and at mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA in Pasadena, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the main parachute opened on time at an altitude of 10,000 feet, however, it could be seen by long-range infrared cameras and some ground observers, resulting in applause and cheers among flight controllers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All stations, we have touchdown,'' announced Thomas Duxbury, the mission project manager.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duxbury said at a later news conference: ''This thing went like clockwork. To see that thing in one piece on the floor of the desert is very moving.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing was particularly tense because of memories of an earlier National Aeronautics and Space Administration probe, the Genesis, which crashed in the same area in 2004 when its parachutes failed to open. Both craft shared similar design and landing systems. The Genesis' collector plates, which trapped solar particles during the craft's two-year mission, were shattered and contaminated, but scientists remain hopeful they can salvage some of the science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Stardust touched down on the salt flats of the Utah desert, a recovery helicopter flew to the spot but could not immediately find the capsule in the early morning darkness. The sample vessel, however, was found shortly before 6 a.m., and recovery teams on two other helicopters swooped in to help secure it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technicians lifted the capsule into a transport cradle and enclosed it in two bags before the lead helicopter flew it to nearby Michael Army Air Field, where a ''clean room'' was set up in a hangar to reduce the chance of contamination. There, masked and suited workers opened the capsule and began preparing it for transport later this week to a laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, elated engineers and scientists said it was hard to describe their feelings now that the sample capsule was safely back on Earth. ''Inside this thing is our treasure, our sample of the edge of the solar system that truly contains star dust,'' said Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington, the mission's principal investigator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We visited a comet, grabbed a piece of it, and it landed here this morning,'' Dr. Brownlee said. ''It's an incredible thrill.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists believe that about a million samples of comet and interstellar dust, most of them less than one-tenth the width of a human hair, are locked inside the capsule. Researchers around the world are awaiting the samples, hoping they will provide clues to the origin of the planets and other bodies in the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grains are believed to be pristine remains of the birth of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. Studying comets not only provides clues to how the solar system was formed but also could help explain how certain materials and conditions combined to form life, researchers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists said the capsule would be cleaned of contamination, including mud and salt from the landing area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duxbury said the Genesis experience was ''a blessing'' for the latest mission because it forced the team to re-examine everything about the Stardust's design and testing, and draft strategies for dealing with a possible mishap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We take our hats off to Genesis for making us much, much smarter,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This final stage of the $212 million Stardust mission began four hours before landing, when the main spacecraft released the sample capsule thousands of miles from Earth, severing cables and using a spring device to push it free. Later, the mother craft fired rockets that pulled it away and placed it into a new orbit around the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The canister entered the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 28,800 miles per hour, the fastest speed any human-made object has achieved entering the atmosphere, causing it to reach peak temperatures around 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After its launching in 1999, the Stardust circled the Sun three times and even flew by the Earth in 2001 for a gravity boost to rendezvous with the comet Wild 2 near Jupiter. The spacecraft came within 149 miles of the comet on Jan. 2, 2004, deploying shields to protect itself from cometary dust while extending a collector filled with a material called aerogel. This low-density silicon material, called ''glass smoke'' because it is composed of 99.8 percent air, gently slowed and trapped particles without significantly altering or damaging them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its long cruise periods, the Stardust also spent 195 days collecting the particles from stars that constantly flow through the solar system from far out in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been a fantastic opportunity to collect the most primitive material in the solar system,'' Dr. Brownlee said. ''We fully expect some of the comet particles to be older than the Sun.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than four decades, humans have been sending out spacecraft to explore the known planets of the solar system. At long last, it is time to visit the last planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a powerful Lockheed Martin Atlas 5 rocket is scheduled to send a spacecraft called New Horizons on a journey to the dim outer reaches of the Sun's realm for the first close-up look at Pluto. If successful, the mission will complete the initial exploration of the nine planets that defined the solar system at the beginning of the space age.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-stage Atlas will hurl the spacecraft away from Earth at a record 36,000 miles per hour, fast enough to pass the Moon in nine hours -- compared with two and a half days for an Apollo mission -- so that it can reach Jupiter in just 13 months. A gravity assist from the giant planet, which also will serve as a test bed for New Horizons' seven instruments, is to speed the craft on to Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once near its target, in 2015, the spacecraft is to conduct about five months of studies, including a dash that takes it within 6,200 miles of Pluto's surface and 16,800 miles from the planet's large moon, Charon. In addition, mission scientists said, it will study two smaller moons, found late last year by the Hubble Space Telescope, and any new features discovered in transit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a fast start, the three-billion-mile journey to Pluto will take at least nine and a half years, and the compact robot craft will have to conserve energy. So for most of the flight, it will be in a state of hibernation, sending a brief weekly signal back to Earth to report its condition and being awakened by mission control only once a year for an instrument check.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the payoff at the end of the mission will be well worth the wait, said Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the mission's principal investigator and team leader.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is in a real sense the capstone of the initial missions to explore the planets,'' Dr. Stern said. ''Pluto, its moons and this part of the solar system are such mysteries that New Horizons will rewrite all of the textbooks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto, discovered in 1930 by the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, turns out to be the first known example of a new class of planetary bodies called ice dwarfs, Dr. Stern said. Scientists think these cold bodies, which number in the hundreds and populate a region beyond Neptune called the Kuiper Belt, represent some of the original building materials of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern dismisses recent debate over whether Pluto is really a planet, since it and its ilk are so different from the solar system's two other major classes of planets, the four rocky inner worlds like Earth and Mercury, and the four giant, gaseous outer planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Ice dwarfs are the most populous group of major bodies in the solar system, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just as a Chihuahua is still a dog, these ice dwarfs are still planetary bodies,'' he said. ''The misfit becomes the average. The Pluto-like objects are more typical in our solar system than the nearby planets we first knew.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once New Horizons completes its studies of the Pluto system, it will be redirected toward one or two other Kuiper Belt objects that will be selected later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,054-pound spacecraft is about the size and shape of a grand piano. It was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which is also managing the mission for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The program's budget is about $700 million, including launching costs and 10 years of operations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the mission will operate too far out to use solar power, New Horizons will draw its power from a plutonium-fueled thermoelectric generator that produces 200 watts of electricity. The use of the highly radioactive plutonium is controversial: antinuclear activists picketed the base last weekend, as they have done before other launchings of nuclear-powered spacecraft, saying a launching explosion could spread dangerous amounts of radiation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the space agency says that a launching accident is highly unlikely and that the fuel pellets in the hardened generator are designed to limit the spread of radiation. As a precaution, emergency management teams are to be stationed around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at launching time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Gibson, the mission's science payload manager, said the craft's instruments included three cameras to take visible light, infrared and ultraviolet images and three spectrometers to study the composition and temperatures of Pluto's thin atmosphere and surface features. The instruments are the most compact, energy-efficient designs ever flown on a planetary mission, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft also carries a University of Colorado dust counter, the first experiment to fly on a planetary mission that is entirely designed and operated by students. This is the only experiment that will not hibernate during the mission. Mission planners said New Horizons would carry some commemorative items from Earth, including an American flag, a small piece of SpaceShipOne, the first privately sponsored manned spacecraft and a CD bearing the names of 435,000 people who signed up on the mission's Web site ( http://pluto.jhuapl.edu [http://pluto.jhuapl.edu]).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Long Voyage''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is scheduled to lift off on the first voyage to Pluto and its moon  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charon. The mission may later be extended to explore additional objects in the Kuiper Belt, the vast region of icy worlds beyond the orbit of Neptune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Shortened Trip  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving the Earth at 36,000 m.p.h., New Horizons will be the fastest craft ever launched. A gravity boost from Jupiter, possible if launched by Feb. 2, will increase the speed by 9,000 m.p.h., shaving up to five years off a direct flight to Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collecting Data  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For long stretches the craft will be put in hibernation. Five months before arrival, it will begin making observations and collecting data from Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 weeks: Image resolution exceeds that of Hubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9 months: Data is downloaded from the craft's recorder. Because of the vast distance, this will take nine months.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-4 weeks: Daily studies begin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">+4 weeks: Post-encounter studies include observing haze in the atmosphere and looking for rings.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of the northern sky has detected a huge and diffuse structure within the confines of the Milky Way that does not seem to fit in with other parts of the galaxy that contains our solar system.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert H. Lupton of Princeton University told a meeting of the American Astronomical Society that the large, faint collection of stars rises almost perpendicular to the flat, spiral disk of the Milky Way. The most likely interpretation of the structure, the astronomer said, is that it is a dwarf galaxy that has been merging with our galaxy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dwarf galaxy lies in the direction of the constellation Virgo at an estimated distance of 30,000 light years from Earth, researchers reported. While some of the stars of the companion galaxy may have been observed with telescopes for centuries, they said, no one realized they belonged to another body because they were so close and commingled with Milky Way stars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milky Way is a flat, pinwheel galaxy measuring more than 100,000 light years across and containing an estimated 200 billion stars, including the sun, along its long, spiral arms and around the bulge at its center. A light year is the distance light travels in a vacuum in a year's time, about six trillion miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers found the merging galaxy through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a project that for more than five years has been mapping the distance and characteristics of millions of objects in space. The project is operated by a consortium of universities and other institutions, and uses a telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest study, which has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal for publication, shows that the Milky Way is still changing and evolving, said Mario Juric, a Princeton graduate student who is the principal author of the report. ''It looks as though the Milky Way is still growing, by cannibalizing smaller galaxies that fall into it,'' Mr. Juric said in a statement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporting at the same meeting, another group of researchers said they had an explanation for a mysterious warp in the disk of the Milky Way that has baffled scientists for decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leo Blitz, professor of astronomy at the University of California, and his colleagues Evan Levine and Carl Heiles charted the warp and found evidence that it is a ripple or vibration set up by two small galaxies that circle the Milky Way. These satellite galaxies, called the Magellanic Clouds, cause vibrations at certain frequencies as they pass though the edges of the Milky Way, the researchers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was previously believed, Dr. Blitz said, that the Magellanic Clouds, with their combined mass being only 2 percent that of the Milky Way, were too small to influence their neighboring galaxy. However, he said, when the Milky Way's dark matter is taken into account, the motion of the small galaxies can create a wake that influences the larger one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter, invisible material that accounts for most of the universe's mass, is 20 times more massive in the Milky Way than all visible material, including stars. According to a computer model created with Martin Weinberg, an astronomy theorist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, dark matter spreading from the Milky Way disk with the gas layer can enhance the gravitational influence of the Magellanic Clouds as they pass through it.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After covering 2.88 billion miles over seven years, the Stardust spacecraft is nearing home with its minute but precious cargo: samples of what are believed to be the oldest materials in the solar system.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucked away in what looks like a giant fly swatter of a collector is dust swooped up from a close encounter with the comet Wild 2 and an accumulation of particles picked up in three circuits of the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been a fantastic opportunity to collect the most primitive material in the solar system,'' said Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington, the principal investigator for the mission. ''We fully expect some of the comet particles to be older than the Sun.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets, icy bodies that normally inhabit a region near Pluto's orbit, are made of material many scientists believe is virtually unchanged since the Sun and the planets formed about 4.6 billion years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studying comets not only provides clues to how the solar system was created but could also help explain how certain materials and conditions combined to form life, researchers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Comets are a library of our history,'' said Thomas Duxbury, project manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which is supervising the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After its launching in 1999, the Stardust circled the Sun and flew by Earth for a gravity boost to rendezvous with Wild 2 (pronounced vilt 2) near Jupiter. On Jan. 2, 2004, the Stardust came within 149 miles of the comet, deploying shields to protect itself from cometary dust while extending a 160-square-inch collector filled with a material called aerogel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This low-density silicon material, composed of 99.8 percent air, gently slowed and trapped particles without significantly altering or damaging them. Stardust also spent 195 days collecting interstellar particles that flow through the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge now is to bring them home safely. If all goes as planned, a capsule bearing the space dust will dive into the atmosphere early Sunday morning and gently parachute the samples to the Utah desert.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But bringing the Stardust home will require an orchestrated sequence of events, many of them performed autonomously by the spacecraft. Adding to the tension is the fact that the Stardust return capsule is similar to one released by an earlier NASA probe called Genesis, which crashed to Earth in 2004 when its parachutes failed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collector plates that trapped solar particles during Genesis' two-year mission were shattered and contaminated, but scientists are trying to recover some of the science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are convinced that this is not going to happen on Stardust,'' said Edward Hirst, the mission's systems manager. ''We took the lessons learned on Genesis and looked at Stardust.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both craft were built by Lockheed Martin and share some systems. But engineers said that the faulty switch believed to have failed in deploying parachutes on the more complex Genesis capsule passed testing on Stardust before launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. Duxbury said, NASA has prepared contingency plans to recover the samples in case the mission, which cost $212 million, ends in a crash landing. ''If we have an accident and land hard, we still think we can get the science out,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust has begun its final preparations to come home. On Nov. 16, it performed the first of three trajectory correction maneuvers aiming it at a target area southwest of Salt Lake City. The second, Hirst said, was performed Thursday and was a textbook maneuver. ''After sifting through all the post-burn data, I expect we will find ourselves right on the money,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last adjustment, scheduled for Friday, will place the craft in a re-entry corridor for a landing point within an ellipse measuring 47 by 27 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans call for Stardust to release its 101-pound sample return capsule on Sunday at 12:57 a.m. Eastern time, when the spacecraft is 68,805 miles from Earth. About 15 minutes later, the main spacecraft is to fire thrusters that divert it from Earth into an orbit around the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four hours after release, the three-foot-wide return capsule is to enter the Earth's atmosphere at 410,000 feet above the Pacific. At 28,860 miles an hour, this will be the fastest a human-made object has ever entered the atmosphere. At 200,000 feet, the capsule's heat shield will reach a peak temperature of 365 degrees Fahrenheit, followed 10 seconds later by peak deceleration as the capsule experiences 38 times the force of gravity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fireball of the descent should be visible from areas in Northern California, Southern Oregon, Northern Nevada, Southern Idaho and Western Utah, depending upon clouds and the brightness of the Moon, NASA officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At about 100,000 feet, a small pilot parachute is to deploy, and the capsule will begin a vertical descent to 10,000 feet, when the large main parachute will unfurl to lower the craft to the ground at less than 10 m.p.h..  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialists aboard helicopters or all-terrain vehicles are to converge on the capsule to secure it and document its landing area. From there the space cargo is to be transferred to a temporary, special ''clean room'' in a hangar at Michael Army Air Field to avoid contamination and then moved to a special laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brownlee said Stardust's cargo should contain more than a million particles weighing in total less than a small fraction of an ounce, with only about 2,000 being as large as the diameter of a human hair. But because scientists will be examining them on a molecular scale, he said, they will look like ''huge, giant rocks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There should be enough samples to occupy scientists for decades without consuming them all, he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''Coming Home''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a journey of nearly 3 billion miles, the Stardust spacecraft is scheduled to return its cargo of comet and interstellar dust to Earth on Sunday morning. Launched in February 1999, the craft met up with Comet Wild 2 in early 2004 (right), passing through the halo of dust and gas surrounding its nucleus to collect samples. Scientists hope the returned particles will provide insight into the origins of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CATCHING A COMET  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To capture the dust, Stardust's collector uses cells filled with aerogel -- the lowest-density solid known. The microscopic dust slams into the gel at over 13,000 m.p.h., leaving behind trails in the gel but remaining relatively intact.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Stardust returns from comet.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International teams of astronomers using telescopes in South America were in the right position on July 10 when Charon, the largest of three known moons of the distant Pluto, briefly blocked the light of a star. This so-called stellar occultation, which lasted less than a minute, provided a flood of data on Charon's size, density and possible atmosphere, researchers report in two papers published today in the journal Nature.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observations indicate that Charon, discovered in 1978, is 750 to 753 miles in diameter, about half that of Pluto. Observing subtle optical effects when the starlight passed the edge of Charon, researchers said the moon showed no evidence of a substantial atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any tenuous atmosphere present would be less than one-sixth of a millionth as dense as the air surrounding the Earth, the reports said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto has a faint nitrogen atmosphere that rises and falls in density during the 248 Earth years it takes to orbit the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Comparing Pluto and Charon, we seem to cross a borderline between bodies which may have bound atmospheres -- like Pluto -- and airless bodies like Charon,'' said Olivier Hainaut of the European Southern Observatory in Chile, a member of one of the teams.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The studies, written by teams headed by Amanda Gulbis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bruno Sicardy of the Paris Observatory, said the findings were consistent with the theory that Charon was formed early in the history of the solar system when a massive object struck Pluto, blasting out a big chunk of its formative material.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accurate data on Charon's size, combined with optical observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope, allows astronomers to estimate the moon's density at 1.71 that of water, which they said indicates it is an icy body with rock making up about half its volume, similar to Pluto itself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charon is so large compared with its host planet and so close that they can almost be considered a double planet, some scientists said. In October, astronomers announced the discovery of two tiny new moons orbiting Pluto in the same plane as Charon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in the Pluto system has been building as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration prepares to launch the first space probe, the New Horizons craft, later this month to Pluto, the outermost planet. If it gets off on time, the spacecraft is expected to fly past Pluto and its moons in 2015.  </p>

For the first time, Congress clearly and explicitly endorsed the Vision for Space Exploration, which was announced by President Bush in January 2004, and directed NASA to plan for a permanent base on the Moon as a steppingstone toward a human mission to Mars. Yet it also tried to ensure that NASA would pursue a broad range of studies beyond the president's exploration plan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill requires that at least 15 percent of the money spent for research on the space station go to studies not related to the exploration programs. That seems consistent with a recent National Academy of Sciences report that complained that NASA was jettisoning fundamental research in the biological and physical sciences and focusing too narrowly on studies that could further the president's exploration goals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But authorization bills do not actually provide money. The real test will come when President Bush submits his budget proposal for fiscal year 2007 in February, and Congressional appropriations committees decide how much money they are willing to put up. If it is significantly less than NASA needs for its assigned tasks, the agency and Congress will need to curtail some of them, lest NASA fall into the old trap of cutting corners and jeopardizing safety. From our perspective, the costly shuttle and the space-station complex look more expendable than pathfinding robotic probes of the solar system and a transition to new manned space vehicles.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 -- A section of insulating foam that unexpectedly broke loose when the space shuttle Discovery lifted off in July will be removed from future fuel tanks to eliminate the hazard, a NASA official said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Gerstenmaier, the agency's director of space operations, said a large section of foam that shielded pipes and cables on the side of the shuttle's large external fuel tank would probably not be used again.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers have long assumed that the area, known as the PAL ramp, needs the insulating foam to protect the equipment. But since the shuttle was designed in the 1970's, the pressurized fuel lines, fixtures and a cable box protected by the ramp have been strengthened. Now, wind-tunnel tests and computer models indicate that the foam is no longer necessary in that area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The best thing to do is to just take it off,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said in a telephone news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers plan additional tests to make sure that removing the PAL ramp will be safe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the launching of the Discovery, the first in the more than two years since the Columbia disaster, NASA engineers were surprised and disturbed when a one-pound chunk of foam broke free from this ramp area despite years of efforts to eliminate or reduce foam shedding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, engineers found tiny cracks in the foam insulation of another fuel tank that had been filled with the shuttle's supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants that may be related to foam coming loose during launchings, agency officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the Discovery's flight, pieces of foam broke loose from four other areas of the redesigned tank, but Mr. Gerstenmaier said those losses had been attributed to causes other than the cracks and had been addressed with other solutions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the next shuttle flight could still take off next May, as NASA has tentatively planned, even with the fuel tank modifications. Officials had said previously that removing the foam ramp could push the flight to the end of 2006, but Mr. Gerstenmaier said a re-examination of old test data and new computer modeling suggested that such a long delay would be unnecessary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Discovery's flight last summer to the International Space Station provided valuable data for future flights by letting NASA assess the many changes made to the shuttle and its operation since the Columbia accident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said NASA was conscious of the cost of operating the shuttle and the added costs of modifications and was taking steps to reduce them. The agency's administrator, Michael Griffin, has testified before Congress that the shuttle program will have to spend $3 billion to $5 billion more than planned to fly 19 more flights before the program ends in 2010. The agency has an annual budget of more than $16 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas sent a letter co-signed by 29 fellow Republicans and 6 Democrats to the White House Office of Management and Budget asking for full NASA financing. Mr. DeLay, the former House majority leader, whose district includes the Johnson Space Center, suggested that NASA might have to retire one of its three shuttles early and lay off workers if more money was not found for the program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To save money, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, NASA is dropping research on some methods of repairing the shuttles' thermal tiles in flight that duplicate other approaches to do the same thing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if there are further delays before the next flight, he said, NASA can still reach its goal of flying the shuttle 18 more times to complete the space station and also mount a repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't need to have a flight this spring to make the 19 flights,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battered and somewhat broken, a sentinel stands between the Earth and the Sun, continually watching for impending solar storms and other activities. For a decade, the spacecraft -- the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO -- has not only peeled back many mysteries of the Sun but also revolutionized studies of the space weather that bathes every corner of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists and engineers around the world are celebrating SOHO's 10th anniversary and heralding it as one of the most productive spacecraft ever flown. Built by the European Space Agency and operated by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., it stares at the Sun 24 hours every day and sends back a steady stream of data and images documenting its influence on everything in its realm.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''SOHO brought home the point that we are living in the extended atmosphere of an active star,'' says Bernard Fleck, the solar physicist who is European project scientist for the spacecraft. ''Aside from its scientific accomplishments, it really has revolutionized the whole space weather business and provided a practical early warning system for solar disruptions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOHO was launched on Dec. 2, 1995, and four months later took up a position about 930,000 miles from Earth at a point where the planet's gravity and that of the Sun hold it in a line between the two. There, the spacecraft's instruments can provide early warning of mass ejections of solar material that can affect astronauts in space, satellites and distant spacecraft, and power and communications systems on Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before SOHO, Earth had little or no warning before being hit by a shockwave of high-energy, radioactive particles from the Sun. The spacecraft now provides space weather forecasters up to three days' notice of Earth-directed disturbances, scientists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOHO's suite of 12 instruments has also changed solar science, including understanding of the steady stream of particles, called solar wind, that are emitted by the Sun and permeate the solar system, said Joseph Gurman, NASA project scientist for the mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the last 10 years,'' Dr. Gurman said, ''SOHO has revolutionized our ideas about the solar interior and atmosphere, and the acceleration of the solar wind.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping SOHO operating past its original two-year mission time has not been easy. Dr. Fleck said, ''Everything that can break has broken.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three stabilizing gyroscopes aboard have failed, but European and American engineers developed software to retain control. All contact with the craft was lost for five months in 1998, but heroic efforts revived it. And in 2003, its main antenna got stuck, but operators found a way to use a secondary antenna to retrieve data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOHO's mission has been extended to 2007 in hope of studying a full 11-year cycle of solar activity. After that, scientists expect that a new NASA spacecraft called the Solar Dynamics Observatory, set for launching in 2008, will assume many of its duties.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar sailing is a bit like a missing link between Carl Sagan and Patrick O'Brian. ''Imagine hoisting a sail and being out there in space,'' says Louis Friedman, the project director of Cosmos 1, the world's first solar-sail spacecraft. ''It's a beautiful idea, and it conjures up the idea of the great sailing ships and whole notion of exploration.'' On June 21, Friedman's team placed the unmanned Cosmos 1 inside an intercontinental ballistic missile and launched it skyward from a Russian submarine. The missile faltered, and Cosmos 1 crashed into the sea -- a scene recalling great shipwrecks more than great discoveries.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if, someday, it works, Friedman says that solar sailing could have many advantages over conventional space flight. For one thing, a solar-sailing vessel does not require fuel. Once in space, the Cosmos 1 would have unfurled eight 50-foot-long sails, which would have arrayed themselves around the ship like flower petals. Engineers built the sails from thin sheets of aluminum-coated Mylar that were designed to reflect photons from the sun's light and thus propel the craft forward. As with an earthbound ship, the angle of the sails was to be manipulated to control the direction of the craft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, a solar-sailing vessel would accelerate very slowly. But its acceleration would be constant, so that in a little over a year's time the craft could be traveling at speeds in excess of conventional rockets. For this reason, Friedman sees solar sailing as the ideal method to visit other planets. It could, he predicts, shave a few years off a satellite's 10-year trip to Pluto.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is the dreamy speculation, anyhow, that Friedman allows himself as he sniffs around for funds to build his next solar-sailing vessel. (The first ship cost about $4 million; he predicts the second will cost about the same.) Friedman is happy to tailor his sales pitch to aesthetes who value scientific romance over rocket science. ''It's like the difference between power boating and sailing,'' he explains. ''The power boaters like their spaceships with big engines. The sailors like solar sailing because you just hoist your sail and catch the light.'' Bryan Curtis   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Branson, who's selling rides into space for $200,000 (cash up front), is close to sealing a deal to take off from a new spaceport in the New Mexico desert. The first flights are scheduled in three years, and his company, Virgin Galactic, has already collected more than $10 million from future passengers.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of paid-up customers includes the architect Philippe Starck, the actress Victoria Principal and the ''Superman Returns'' director, Bryan Singer. There's a waiting list of thousands, ranging from the actor William Shatner to the cosmologist Stephen Hawking.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Branson expects this venture to more than pay for itself, enabling him to start lowering ticket prices and expanding the business. ''We're going to plow all the money back into space,'' he told me. ''We'd love one day to have a hotel up there and keep pushing the boundaries.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has ordered five spaceships and plans to send more than 700 people into space in the first 18 months, which is more than all the government-sponsored space programs have sent in history. There's a lesson here for Congress and the White House as they haggle over financing NASA's plans for the Moon and Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Virgin Galactic spaceship will be a larger eight-person version of the ship that last year won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for a reusable spacecraft. Its designer, Burt Rutan, backed by the billionaire Paul Allen, spent over $25 million to beat two dozen competitors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the beauty of offering prizes: a little money buys a lot more R.&amp;D. than you would ever get by giving the funds to NASA. Prizes spurred Charles Lindbergh and others to quickly turn aviation from a stunt into an industry. Competition inspires innovations that would never be approved by bureaucrats -- like modeling a spaceship on a badminton shuttlecock.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rutan's spaceship, unlike NASA's space shuttle, doesn't need elaborate tiles as a heat shield because it re-enters the atmosphere much more slowly. Before returning to Earth, it changes its streamlined shape by feathering its wings, enabling it to descend relatively gently, like a shuttlecock.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Rutan and Branson and other entrepreneurs are entering space, there's no need for NASA to poke around in Earth orbit with the space shuttle and the space station. Nor does it need to return to the Moon. Rutan figures that private spaceships will be going there before long, so he'd rather see NASA concentrate on ways to reach Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So would I, but not all by itself. Instead of just financing NASA's plans for Mars, Congress and the White House should make it compete against engineers like Rutan. It could offer a prize, to be awarded by the National Academy of Engineering or the National Research Council, for the best plan on paper for a manned mission to Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Branson told me he'd be willing to enter that competition for a prize of $10 million -- a pittance next to NASA's $16 billion annual budget. Robert Zubrin, the president of the Mars Society, said he'd enter it, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even better idea would be to offer prizes for making actual progress on a Mars mission, not just drawing up plans. Zubrin suggests that the federal government get entrepreneurs started by offering a $5 billion prize for the first flight of a vehicle that can lift 120 tons into orbit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There could also be a grand $30 billion Mars Prize for getting a human to Mars and planting the American flag. That would be a bargain compared with the current plans of NASA, which wants to get to Mars by first spending $100 billion just to reach the Moon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realize that Congress and the White House are reluctant to upset NASA's monopoly because they don't want to offend government workers and the contractors defending the status quo. But these engineers could be eligible for the prize, too. The teams competing might well subcontract parts of the mission -- like tracking the spacecraft -- to divisions of NASA, and those government workers could share in the cash.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Mars Prize would have one wonderful political advantage over doling out money to NASA. Today's politicians could announce the prize without scrimping to pay for it in any budget anytime soon. They would get the immediate glory of inaugurating an interplanetary quest, and someone else would get the bill.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The amusing part of all this is, this little gal taking on these big organizations,'' said Lowell Grissom, 71, the astronaut's brother. ''I think everybody kind of gets a kick out of that. She's stirred them up a little bit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stirred them up, indeed, but the suit is still at the Florida museum and will remain there for at least another two years. What happens after that is unclear.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda lives with her parents, Carolyn and Larrie, and siblings Andriene, 13, and Zachary, 12. The walls of her bedroom are full of astronaut pictures, including a poster of Gus Grissom sent by Scott Grissom. Around the room, there are books about space flight, a ceramic Space Shuttle that she made and Kennedy Space Center playing cards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father, who manages a heating and air-conditioning business, said that although Amanda was very much a teenager, she had always carried herself with maturity and drive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She was born older,'' he said. ''Even at 2 or 3 years old, people were amazed by her mannerisms, how she would speak and things like that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda's mother, who works part time as a travel agent and as an assistant for a local publisher, said that her daughter, who has endured 11 operations for chronic hip dysplasia, could relate to Gus Grissom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it was because he was kind of the underdog astronaut,'' Ms. Meyer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgil I. Grissom, who was known as Gus, was among the seven pioneering Mercury astronauts. In 1961, he became the second American in outer space and, with his Gemini flight in 1965, the first man from any country to make multiple flights. To the chagrin of admirers like Amanda, Mr. Grissom is largely remembered for his Mercury capsule sinking after splashdown and his fiery death in 1967, with Edward White and Roger Chaffee, during training for the Apollo 1 mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, Mr. Grissom had brought home his Mercury spacesuit. His family said that NASA was about to discard the aluminized nylon and rubber outfit and that the astronaut saved it, some time in 1961 or 1962. NASA officials said he signed it out in 1965, for a school presentation. After the astronaut's death, they said, the space agency never retrieved it, but it remained government property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the spacesuit hung in a closet at Betty Grissom's home in Houston. ''It was kind of like still having him around the house,'' she said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1980's, the family lent the spacesuit to the privately owned Astronaut Hall of Fame in Titusville, Fla. But in 2002, with the museum experiencing financial woes, NASA and the Delaware North Companies Parks and Resorts, which operates numerous federal tourist sites, took over the operation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some of Mr. Grissom's other lent items, such as a logbook and a Stetson given to him by President Lyndon B. Johnson, were returned to the family, NASA refused to hand over the spacesuit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda, a sophomore at Daniel Hand High School in Madison, had been enthralled by outer space since the third grade, when her parents gave her a telescope for Christmas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fourth grade, her teacher asked for a brief biography of an astronaut. Looking to write about someone other than John Glenn or Neil Armstrong, Amanda asked her mother about the lesser-known space heroes. She chose Mr. Grissom, whom she found compelling not only for his achievements, but for his quiet manner and determination.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the encouragement of her parents, she continued learning about Mr. Grissom and the space program. In 2001, the family had attended a Space Shuttle launch. Amanda said all of her book reports involved NASA, and when asked for an essay about a personal hero, she always chose Mr. Grissom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He never doubted that this was the right thing to die for,'' Amanda said. ''He even made that statement, that it was worth the risk.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In eighth grade, for an English class, she wrote about Mr. Grissom again. But this time, the teacher, Martha Curran, suggested the students share their papers with whomever they chose as their hero.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Amanda said, 'I can't do mine because he's gone,' '' Ms. Curran said. ''And I said, 'What about his family? Don't you think that they would be honored to know that a teenager today still cares about him and what he did for the world?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda tried to send her paper to Betty Grissom through NASA, without success. In May 2004, Amanda and her mother traveled to Florida for the Astronaut Hall of Fame induction ceremony, hoping Mrs. Grissom might attend. She did not, but Amanda did come face to face with Mr. Grissom's Mercury spacesuit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, Ms. Meyer located Scott Grissom, the astronaut's son, through the Internet. She mailed him a copy of Amanda's essay, she said, and Mr. Grissom called from Texas to chat with Amanda. It was then that Amanda learned about the spacesuit dispute and vowed to win it back for the family.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've always wanted to help out the Grissom family, because I never felt they were treated fairly,'' she said. ''I felt if I could get the spacesuit moved, then it might make life a little bit easier for them, that it might make things a little less complicated and less tense between them and NASA.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grissom, 55, a pilot for Federal Express, tried to warn her about the morass she was about to enter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told her she was going to get a real education in the U.S. government,'' he said. ''And I wished her a lot of luck.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda fervently took to her cause. She collected signatures for her petition for the return of the spacesuit. Realizing that the government would never give the family the suit, she changed the petition to call for the transfer of the spacesuit to the Virgil I. Grissom Memorial Museum in Mitchell, Ind., the astronaut's hometown. (The museum already has Mr. Grissom's Gemini spacesuit and Gemini spacecraft.) Soliciting supporters at school, area supermarkets and on the Internet, Amanda said, she gathered more than 5,000 signatures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also sent e-mail messages to Gov. M. Jodi Rell, the entire Connecticut Congressional delegation and other politicians, including Mr. Glenn, a senator from Ohio. And though most replies were perfunctory, some took notice. The office of Senator Christopher J. Dodd, for example, made inquiries on her behalf to NASA and the Smithsonian.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a family trip to Florida, Amanda met with Daniel LeBlanc, who runs the Astronaut Hall of Fame for Delaware North, and pressed her point. She also contacted NASA. When she learned that ownership of the spacesuit had been transferred to the Smithsonian, she set her sights on that organization's top man, Secretary Lawrence M. Small.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She repeatedly sent e-mail messages to Mr. Small, demanding that the spacesuit be returned to the Grissoms. Amanda said she wrote to him about 50 times a day, ''from my e-mail, from my mother's e-mail, from my sister's e-mail. I asked my friends to e-mail him as well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claire Brown, a spokeswoman for the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, confirmed that the organization received messages from Amanda, though far fewer than the teenager suggested. ''The e-mail addresses she has used, one is for Carolyn Meyer, her mother, and the other one was a really funny name: Princess Fluffy.'' (Those are the names of two of the family's three cats.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Washington Post, The Associated Press and newspapers in Connecticut, Florida and Indiana have written about Amanda and her crusade. Still, no one's stance has budged very much.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betty Grissom opposes a compromise; she simply wants the spacesuit back. And despite Amanda's pronouncement of victory this fall on her Web site ( www.freewebs.com/mercury7savethesuit [http://www.freewebs.com/mercury7savethesuit]), Ms. Brown said that the spacesuit would remain in Florida at least another two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be lent to another museum one day, Smithsonian officials said, but as an artifact requiring special care, they don't expect to give it directly to the Grissoms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smithsonian officials have also been frustrated by errors on Amanda's Web site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She has the passion of youth,'' Ms. Brown said. ''But she doesn't have the experience to really understand issues like collections care and some of the other practices, standards, policies that we're required to follow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the Smithsonian sent Amanda and her family a letter, asking that various statements be removed from her Web site. One item they wanted taken off the site was Amanda's request for help to raise $23,000 through corporate donations for the cost of housing and protecting the spacesuit at the Grissom memorial. The Smithsonian had not agreed to move the suit there. Copies of the Smithsonian's letter went to several other people, including the Smithsonian's general counsel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda's mother considered that an intimidation tactic and wrote a letter to Vice President Cheney, who is on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. He has not responded, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's asking him to have a full investigation and to let Amanda speak before the Senate and find out what the hell is going on down there at the Smithsonian,'' Ms. Meyer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With or without a Congressional speaking engagement, Amanda is learning plenty: about Gus Grissom, the space program and the vagaries of fighting Uncle Sam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no college in America that can teach her this,'' said Steven Grissom, 31, a distant relation of Gus Grissom's family and a teacher in Mitchell, Ind., who has spoken with Amanda several times. ''She is learning how her government works, the red-tape bureaucracy, the ins and outs and the networking that's got to be done. She is learning a truly valuable lesson that she will never forget.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda said she expected some red tape, but nowhere near what she had encountered. ''I thought it would be a pain, but I didn't think it would be this confusing,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda said she still hoped the spacesuit would be transferred to the Indiana museum and promised to keep fighting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm the kind of person who will continue to ram my head against the wall until I go through it,'' she said. ''I won't give up until I get done what I need to get done. I never quit before, so, I'm like, why start now?''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 -- NASA engineers have found tiny cracks in the foam insulation of a space shuttle fuel tank and suspect that those cracks are related to the foam debris that has come loose during launchings, agency officials said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although engineers are still looking for the main reason behind the foam shedding during the launching of the Discovery in July, a detailed examination of the tank that was to have flown on that mission may provide a clue, John Chapman, a project manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said at a news conference televised from the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While studying the tank and its appendages with new scanning techniques at the agency's Michoud tank factory in New Orleans, technicians found nine hairline cracks in a foam ramp that protects fuel lines outside the tank, Mr. Chapman said. Only two of the weblike cracks were visible on the surface, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Hale, the shuttle program manager, said the tank had been filled twice and drained of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel while attached to the Discovery at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The tank was later removed for an unrelated problem, and a new tank that had not previously been fueled was flown on the Discovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said it appeared that pressure and temperature changes experienced by the tank during fueling could have caused the foam cracks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During last summer's launching, the first since the Columbia disaster, NASA managers were surprised and disturbed when a one-pound chuck of foam broke free from the ramp area despite efforts over more than two years to eliminate or reduce foam shedding. The Columbia and its seven-member crew were lost on Feb. 1, 2003, when hot gases entered a hole punched into its wing by foam debris at the launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chapman said it was too early to tell whether the cracks in the foam of the unused tank were detrimental or contributed to debris shedding. ''No crack is inconsequential in the business that we are in,'' he said. ''We are still trying to figure out what this means,'' he said. ''At this point, we haven't found a smoking gun.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said NASA was looking into eliminating the foam ramps that run down the side of the fuel tank, but studies to determine whether it is possible are not expected to be completed until next fall. Since the shuttle was designed in the 1970's, the pipes and fixtures protected by the ramps have been modified and strengthened, he said, and may be able to fly without the foam shields.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next one or two shuttle flights will include the protective ramps, but, Mr. Hale said, tanks used on those missions will have existing ramps removed and new ones applied to reduce the chance of flaws.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said that if all the fuel tank studies went well, the next shuttle mission could fly next spring, with launching sometime from May 3 to May 23. But no date will be set until all work related to safety is completed, he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Science Times on Tuesday about an asteroid that has a slight chance of hitting Earth in 2036 misspelled the surname of the chairman of the B612 Foundation, which has urged NASA to plan a mission to it. He is Rusty Schweickart, not Schweikart.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, a subheading incorrectly described the diameter of the asteroid. As the article reported, it is about the length of three football fields, not one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Nov 24 2005   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a human perspective, Earth-crossing asteroids can have good timing or bad timing. Good timing is when the asteroid and the Earth don't meet. Bad timing is when they do.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers say that a 1,000-foot diameter asteroid discovered last year may have bad timing. There is a slight possibility that the rock, 99942 Apophis, will hit Earth in 2036 after coming within about 20,000 miles in 2029. A collision could cause regional devastation on a scale far worse than last year's tsunami.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most likely thing is that it is not going to be a threat,'' said Rusty Schweikart, the former Apollo astronaut and chairman of the B612 Foundation, which is concerned about protecting Earth from asteroids. ''There's 5,499 chances out of 5,500 that it's going to miss us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with Apophis, Mr. Schweikart said, is that that one chance cannot yet be ruled out. Better optical and radar observations are needed to determine the asteroid's orbit, but the best measurements cannot be made until 2013.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That creates a different timing problem. If the threat from Apophis cannot be ruled out by then, will there be time to deflect it? Mr. Schweikart's group is not sure and has urged NASA to plan a robotic mission to put a radio transponder on the asteroid so that its orbit can be precisely determined. If such a mission takes 10 years to design and execute, it will still give plenty of time to plan and carry out a deflection mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has said that planning for a transponder mission can wait till after the more precise measurements are made in 2013.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a very high confidence that we can pinpoint exactly the track it's going to follow,'' said Andy Dantzler, director of NASA's solar system division. In the unlikely event that in 2013 a transponder mission would still be necessary, there would be enough time for that and a deflection mission, if needed, as well, he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schweikart said that NASA's response was ''probably fine.'' But he added that it made ''aggressive assumptions about how good things are going to be, and how much we're going to know.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward T. Lu, a current astronaut and a board member of B612, said a transponder mission made sense, given the timeline and the potential risks. ''We buy insurance for stuff that's a lot less likely than 1 in 5,500,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should deflection prove necessary, Mr. Lu said, it will have to happen before 2029, so that Apophis will miss a ''keyhole'' -- a region in space only 2,000 feet wide where earth's gravitational pull will put the asteroid on a collision course. Deflecting it after that, when it would have to miss a much bigger target, Earth, is not technologically possible in so short a time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lu and another astronaut, Stanley G. Love, have a proposal for how to go about deflecting the asteroid: by using a spacecraft to tow it, but without a tow line. In a brief paper in Nature, the two describe how such a gravitational tractor, hovering near an asteroid with its engines canted to avoid the exhaust's hitting the surface, can slowly pull it into a different orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pulling force would only be about one newton, or roughly the amount of force used to hold a full cup of coffee. ''But the point is, if you hang out long enough, it can add up to a substantial oomph,'' Mr. Lu said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''No Strings Attached''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two astronauts have proposed a novel way to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, by using the gravitational pull of a spacecraft to tow it into a different orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SPACECRAFT (artist's conception)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electric propulsion, perhaps using nuclear energy, would be necessary. The engines would be fired at an angle to avoid the asteroid's surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SLIGHT PULL  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovering above the asteroid, the craft would exert a very small gravitational force on it. But over a month or more the asteroid's course would be altered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTHER OPTIONS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMPACT  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nonexplosive impactor might only break the asteroid into large pieces that could still threaten Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATTACHED ROCKET  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixing it to the asteroid would be difficult. The asteroid's rotation also creates problems.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHORTLY after 9/11, I traveled to Houston with the historian Stephen E. Ambrose to conduct interviews with Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, for the official NASA oral history. I considered it an honor. Armstrong had been a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952, and had flown 78 combat missions over the Korean peninsula in a Grumman F9F-2 Panther. (James Michener, reporting on the Korean War for The Saturday Evening Post, was so impressed with the derring-do of Armstrong and his fellow aviators from the carrier Essex, that he profiled the squadron in his novel ''The Bridges at Toko-Ri''). When I asked Armstrong about the Air Medal and Gold Star he earned in Korea, however, he froze, saying they were ''unimportant.'' Asked later if he had ever moon-gazed in the days before the Apollo 11 liftoff, Armstrong scoffed, ''No. I never did that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 75-year-old Armstrong has become our nation's most bashful Galahad. While his space feats appear in American history textbooks, he could walk into any Wal-Mart or Neiman Marcus and not be recognized. Disdainful of the modern news media -- and insistent on not commercializing his ''moon walk'' -- Armstrong lives on a farm near Lebanon, Ohio, with his second wife, far from the autograph hounds. (Charles Lindbergh, who befriended Armstrong before his moon flight, warned him about the pitfalls of fame.) Armstrong is not, however, a hermit. He often delivers scientific papers like ''New Knowledge of the Earth From Space Exploration'' and ''The Ozone Layer Controversy'' at international conferences. And, as it turns out, he was cooperating with James R. Hansen, a professor of history at Auburn University. Hansen interviewed Armstrong for 50 hours in preparing ''First Man,'' a fine authorized biography brimming with groundbreaking research, fresh anecdotes and fair-minded analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armstrong's home state, Ohio, had an immense formative influence on him. His father, Stephen Armstrong, worked for the Ohio Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public Offices, which required him to hopscotch around the state like an itinerant plumber. Although Neil was born in Wapakoneta (on Aug. 5, 1930), his boyhood was one long truck odyssey, with stints in Lisbon, Warren, Ravenna, Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, Jefferson, Moulton, St. Marys and Upper Sandusky, then back to Wapakoneta. ''In these genuine Smallvilles,'' Hansen writes, ''young people -- with the right kind of family and community support -- grew up embracing ambition.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 10, Neil -- who was shy but strong-willed -- got his first job, cutting grass in a cemetery, and became a Boy Scout leader. Hansen, in fact, points out that out of the 294 candidates selected to be NASA astronauts between 1959 and 2003, over 200 had been active in Scouting (and 11 of the 12 astronauts to moonwalk were scouts). Meanwhile, Hansen dispels a number of falsehoods that circulated at the time of Apollo 11 about Armstrong's youth. He never studied the galaxy from his neighbor Jacob Zint's telescope. He had not read about the Wright Brothers in the first grade. But it was true that he flew in a Ford trimotor when he was 5 or 6, built exquisite model airplanes and had a recurring dream. ''I could, by holding my breath, hover over the ground,'' Armstrong recalls of these nighttime reveries. ''I neither flew nor fell in those dreams; I just hovered.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armstrong got a student pilot's certificate on his 16th birthday. Weeks later he was soaring solo over Ohio farmscapes. By the time he enrolled in Purdue University, aeronautical engineering was his obsession. But his college studies were interrupted by the Korean War, and the amateur aviator became a bona fide American fighter pilot. ''The great airplanes I had so revered as a boy were disappearing,'' Armstrong told Hansen. ''I had grown up admiring what I perceived to be the chivalry of the World War I pilots -- Frank Luke, Eddie Rickenbacker, Manfred von Richthofen and Billy Bishop. But by World War II, aerial chivalry seemed to have evaporated. . . . Air warfare was becoming very impersonal. The record-setting flights -- [John] Alcock and [A. W.] Brown, [Harold] Gatty, [Charles] Lindbergh, [Amelia] Earhart and [Jimmy] Mattern -- across the oceans, over the poles and to the corners of Earth, had all been accomplished. And I resented that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the moon? That was virgin territory. Most of ''First Man'' recounts, often in exacting slide-rulerish detail, how Armstrong worked his way to become a moon-bound astronaut. As a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California, Armstrong made over 900 flights in a wide range of models, even going hypersonic in a North American X-15. Clearly he possessed what Tom Wolfe called ''the right stuff.'' (Shockingly, Hansen claims that Chuck Yeager, Wolfe's cockpit ace, exaggerated his own heroics in his 1985 autobiography.) A turning point in Armstrong's life came in 1962 when his young daughter died of an inoperable brain tumor. ''People who knew Armstrong well,'' Hansen notes, ''indicated that Neil never once over the years brought up the subject of his daughter's illness and death.'' A few months after Karen Anne Armstrong's demise, her father signed up to be an astronaut.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using NASA records, Hansen superbly reconstructs the Gemini 8 mission (March 16, 1966) when Armstrong performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space. His reputation for sheer technical competence became legendary at Johnson Space Center in Texas. According to Chris Kraft, the chief of flight operations in Houston, Armstrong was tapped ''first man'' over Edwin ''Buzz'' Aldrin, one of his sidekicks on Apollo 11, because, ''Neil was Neil. Calm, quiet and absolute confidence. We all knew that he was the Lindbergh type. He had no ego.'' A disappointed Aldrin grew increasingly resentful that he had not been chosen. Hansen, though, takes Armstrong's side in the lingering ''first man'' squabble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One debate that Hansen straddles regards Armstrong's phrase ''That's one small step for [a] man. One giant leap for mankind.'' While Armstrong claims that those dramatic words came to him eureka-style while sitting in the Eagle landing craft on the lunar surface, Hansen offers other possible variations. Some Apollo 11 buffs speculate, for example, that ''The Hobbit,'' by J. R. R. Tolkien, was an influence on Armstrong because of the line ''not a great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark.'' This theory is given further credence because after leaving NASA in 1971 Armstrong named his farm Rivendell, a site in Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings.'' Then there is an April 19, 1969, internal NASA memorandum that suggested Armstrong or Aldrin declare a ''forward step for all mankind.'' On the morning of Armstrong's walk, Walter Cronkite talked about ''a giant leap,'' echoing President Dwight Eisenhower's 1957 post-Sputnik call for ''a giant leap into outer space.'' These coincidences have led to a widespread rumor that NASA had scripted the immortal words; they didn't. When presented with all this, Armstrong shrugged. ''You never know subliminally in your brain where things come from,'' he says. ''But it certainly wasn't conscious. When an idea runs for the first time through your own mind, it comes out as an original thought.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regrettably, there are no color photographs of Armstrong walking on the moon: Aldrin did not snap a single one. But we do have 842 pounds of rock from the different space missions that still haven't been properly analyzed. This scientific neglect is not surprising. While millions of Americans were glued to their television sets back in July 1969, the historic moon walk has evolved into a retro spectacle with little contemporary currency. And Neil Armstrong, once the most sought-after interview in the world, has virtually disappeared from the public eye. If nothing else, Hansen should be commended for decoding the enigmatic Armstrong: a space hero short on words but sky-high on Midwestern integrity.  </p>

That's nine years after President Bush leaves office. Starting from scratch in 1961, President Kennedy's commitment to put a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth was realized in just eight years. What is going on?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apollo 11 moon landing on July 16, 1969, transcended the superpower struggle for world domination that had motivated it. People everywhere were awed by what was above all an inspiring demonstration of human achievement. Could lunar colonies, expeditions to Mars and even the stars be far behind?   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just three years later, however, as the war in Southeast Asia drained American resources, the era of human space exploration abruptly ended. In 36 years, no human has ventured beyond the relative safety of low-Earth orbit. Who could have imagined, on that magic night in the summer of 1969, that the moon might be as far into space as humans would ever go?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, President George H.W. Bush spoke from the steps of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington. The president called for a return to the moon and for a human expedition to Mars. ''Like Columbus,'' he said, ''we dream of distant shores we've not yet seen.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George W. Bush seems driven to complete his father's unfinished business in space, as in Iraq. But much has changed. The cold war, which provided the initial motivation for our space program, is long gone. And technological progress has superseded human space exploration. Remotely controlled instruments have become natural extensions of frail human bodies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of what we yearn to discover in space is inaccessible to humans. Astronauts on Mars, locked in their spacesuits, could not venture far from shelter amid the constant bombardment of energetic particles that are unscreened by the thin atmosphere. Beyond Mars, there is no place humans can go in the foreseeable future. The great adventure of the 21st century will be to explore where no human can possibly set foot. The great quest is to find life to which we are not related. Could nature have solved the problem of life in some other way, in some other place? When we find out, we will know much more about ourselves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two mechanical geologists, Spirit and Opportunity, are doing this even now, by searching for evidence of water on opposite sides of Mars. They don't break for lunch or complain about the cold nights, and they live on sunshine. They've been at it for nearly two years, yet their mission costs less than sending a shuttle to the International Space Station. The brains of Spirit and Opportunity are the brains of geologists back on Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress in society is measured by the extent to which work that is dangerous or menial is done by machines. The benefits we enjoy from the space program -- weather satellites, communications satellites and global positioning -- come from robotic spacecraft. Few scientists are calling for a human mission to the Moon or Mars. Human space exploration is essentially over. It is too expensive and provides too little return. But politicians know that the American public identifies progress in space with human astronauts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration's solution is to create an impossibly expensive and pointless program for some other administration to cancel, thus bearing the blame for ending human space exploration. The return to the moon is not a noble quest. It is a poison pill.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has finally unveiled its plans for carrying out the ambitious space exploration program that was announced by President Bush in January 2004 but left vague and undefined ever since. The proposed new space vehicles look like a sensible way to put astronauts and cargo into space after the shuttle fleet is retired and will be built to facilitate landings on both the Moon and Mars. Michael Griffin, the new administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, deserves credit for putting real flesh on what had been little more than an aspiration. Unfortunately, the new plan lacks the pizzazz to inspire public support and will be operating under budget constraints that make delays or overruns likely.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new crew exploration vehicle will be built around well-known space technologies, with booster rockets and engines derived from the shuttle program and a crew capsule like the one used in the lunar program, only bigger. That has the great advantage of letting NASA use much of its current shuttle work force on the new program and the great disadvantage of making the technology look retrograde. This approach will not excite those looking for cutting-edge hardware, but it seems reasonable at a time when reliability is the main goal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The configuration largely eliminates the two hazards that destroyed the Columbia and the Challenger. NASA calculates that the new vehicle should be 10 times safer than the shuttle, with perhaps a 1 in 2,000 chance of a catastrophe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan pays only the barest lip service to international cooperation; Europe, Japan, China and India all have lunar programs of one kind or another under way. Mr. Griffin said NASA hoped to send Americans back to the Moon by 2018 under its own program but was open to partnerships on what to do or build on the lunar surface. Given that most experts say international collaboration will be imperative on a high-cost mission to Mars, it seems desirable to enlist international partners very early.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to see how NASA can complete all the tasks on its agenda while operating on a constrained budget, which is scheduled to grow at only the rate of inflation. The agency needs to repair the damage to its facilities from Katrina, fly the shuttle safely until 2010, complete the space station by that date, fly the new crew exploration vehicle by 2012 and return to the Moon by 2018 or 2020, all the while carrying out its science, aeronautics and robotics programs. The safety valve is that NASA will carry out the exploration program on a ''go as you can afford to pay'' basis, without raiding money from other space programs. That means that cost overruns may stretch out the completion dates, and leave the exploration vision a more distant prospect.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, NASA itself, still reeling from unexpected foam shedding on the first test flight since the Columbia disaster, has been forced to postpone the next shuttle flight until March or later while it struggles to fix the problem.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both events ought to force the administration and Congress to take a much harder look at how long the shuttles should keep flying -- or perhaps whether they should be flying at all. The underlying problems suggest the need to retire the shuttles quickly, both to end this needless flirtation with catastrophe and to free up funds for more exciting space ventures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After NASA spent two and a half years trying to repair the shuttles and instill a more rigorous, safety-conscious attitude in its work force, it was depressing to read a 19-page critique by the seven panelists accusing NASA of cutting corners to meet unrealistic launching schedules. That was precisely the kind of management failure that brought us the Challenger disaster of 1986 and the Columbia accident in 2003. If left uncorrected, it will probably bring us another shuttle catastrophe in years to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven critics were a minority on the panel, which had 25 members and was known as the Stafford-Covey Task Group, after the two former astronauts who led it. The panel was set up two years ago to assess how well NASA was doing in meeting the recommendations of the board that investigated the Columbia accident. In a lengthy final report issued this week, the task group concluded that NASA had met most but not all of the board's requirements.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven critics added a withering commentary based on observations they had made during two years of monitoring NASA up close. They found that arbitrary launching dates had led engineers to choose quick solutions for technical problems, not necessarily the best solutions. If a problem looked too hard to solve, the engineers and managers had a tendency to define it away. Performance standards that were supposedly mandatory became goals that simply required NASA's ''best effort.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's top leadership was accused of failing to set high standards and hold people accountable for meeting them, although the new NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, was praised for astute interventions after his arrival. Most troubling of all was the bald assertion in the minority report that NASA's much vaunted engineering force had lost its appetite for careful and rigorous analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One technical review meeting degenerated into a series of status reports, with not a single technical question asked or answered. It can only be disheartening that such lackadaisical behavior is still entrenched after all the exhortations for NASA to reach new heights of vigilance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of the panel -- which included members with substantial expertise in space matters, including some who have headed large technically based organizations -- did not sign on to the minority report. Some members even praised NASA's performance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the minority report gains credence from the wealth of detail it cites and the expertise of the critics. Their ranks include a retired NASA engineer who spent years in key positions within the agency; an astronaut who made five shuttle flights and now oversees military space launchings in Florida; a longtime deputy director in the Navy's nuclear program, which is frequently touted as a model of technical management; a former director of the Congressional Budget Office; a former under secretary of the Navy; an academic who managed recovery operations in Texas after the Columbia accident; and a professor of public administration who has been analyzing the need to encourage dissenting views in organizations like NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a marginal group that can be dismissed as a bunch of misguided rabble-rousers. All seven were appointed by NASA because of their presumed expertise and objectivity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin pledged yesterday to read the critique carefully, as well as the main report, to extract ideas for improving the space program. He contended that the agency had made great strides in improving the shuttle and tightening its engineering discipline, but he clearly wants to shuck off the shuttle program when feasible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new administrator said he was no longer aiming at a specific number of shuttle flights but was working instead toward an expeditious but orderly retirement of the shuttle over the next five years -- enough time, he thinks, to finish the space station. If the minority critique is anywhere near on target, as it appears to be, he ought to move that retirement date forward considerably.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the space shuttle fleet has been grounded until NASA can solve its foam-shedding problem, it's time to re-examine the future of the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station is circling the globe, partly finished, some 240 miles overhead. Its fate and that of the shuttle fleet are intertwined. The shuttle is a finicky and technologically outdated vehicle that should be replaced with a safer and more reliable spacecraft. The rub is that a replacement is at least five years away and the space station cannot be completed without many more shuttle flights.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the space station did not have to be finished, there would be little reason to keep the shuttle fleet in operation beyond a single flight to refurbish the Hubble Space Telescope. But how important, really, is the station?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear top government officials tell it, the station has to be completed to honor solemn obligations to our 15 international partners and to gain scientific knowledge of great importance to further travel in space. Both rationales are highly questionable. Indeed, it looks as though the United States is bent on spending billions more dollars and at least five years of effort to complete a station that will have only minimal value for more ambitious explorations of the Moon or Mars, the long-range goals enunciated by President Bush. It will do so because of a possibly mistaken belief that our international partners will be outraged if we give up in midstream.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albatross in the Making  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems little doubt that the station has been a disastrous misallocation of resources. It has already cost $75 billion to $80 billion by some counts, and even NASA's own manager of the space station program has acknowledged that no one would invest that kind of money in the project today. The station's planned size and capabilities have shriveled steadily under the impact of huge cost overruns, repeated downsizings, and slowdowns in the wake of the Challenger and Columbia accidents. Today, the half-finished structure is limping along with two crew members, the bare minimum needed to keep it operating. If the shuttles start flying again, there are plans to complete the station by 2010 and enlarge the crew to six or seven, the number most experts think is needed to perform worthwhile science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Station supporters say we would be foolish not to keep going and get at least some value from our huge investment. But spending billions more on a white elephant would be throwing good money after bad. Worse yet, focusing our prime efforts on flying the shuttles to finish the station will inevitably drain resources from NASA's other research programs and slow the planned shift to human exploration of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scientific Rationale  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it is fashionable in some circles to denigrate the research conducted so far as little more than make-work for the astronauts, the National Academy of Sciences rates some of it highly. The real problem is that the value of the work is not commensurate with the cost of the station-shuttle complex. The studies are not remotely comparable to the path-breaking research conducted by NASA's armada of orbiting telescopes and its robotic probes of distant planets. When NASA threatened to abandon the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers rose in wrath. If the station disappeared tomorrow, the response would most likely be tepid.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA now plans to shrink the station's research and focus it on studies to examine the long-term effects of space travel on human biology. But the station will have limited value for that purpose. It is shielded by the Earth's magnetic field from the fierce cosmic radiation thought to pose the greatest danger in interplanetary travel, so it will tell us little about how to cope with that problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the presumed trump card for the station -- the opportunity to study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on the health of crew members -- has been greatly exaggerated. In low Earth orbit the astronauts are subjected to zero gravity, whereas on the Moon they would face one-sixth Earth's gravity, and on Mars one-third. The important question is how those low levels of gravity will affect their health. Incredibly, the one scientific instrument that could shed light on the issue -- a centrifuge that would subject test animals to a range of different gravities -- seems likely to be eliminated from the station. Zero gravity would be relevant on a trip to Mars, but that journey can be made in less time than astronauts have already spent in weightless environments in orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the Partners Want  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason some administration officials cite for completing the station is a fear of antagonizing our international partners. Some of them, notably Japan and the European Space Agency, have invested substantial sums on modules for the station that have yet to be put up. Any effort to explore the Moon or Mars will be hugely costly and best done with international cooperation, so it would foolish to renege on promises unless the partners agree.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody seems sure just what the partners really want. Their space agency heads have formally agreed to complete the station, but whether the governing powers in these countries would welcome a way to ease their own budget problems has not been thoroughly tested. There are credible reports that even space authorities in some partner countries are appalled that the high cost of operating the station will eat up their own budgets, constraining other space ventures. If diplomatic concerns are to be the main rationale for completing the station, diplomats should try harder to ascertain whether the partners might be willing to accept half a loaf.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whither the Station?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the shuttle fleet remains grounded for a long time, the station will have to stay as is and rely on smaller Russian spacecraft to carry up crew members and cargo. That seems like a sensible approach over all. But NASA is not talking about that as a serious option. Rather, the debate is over how many flights to schedule before the shuttles' planned retirement in 2010. Michael Griffin, the new NASA administrator, has been talking of 19 or 20.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The better, but more drastic option would be to retire the shuttles immediately and back out of the station. That would save some $40 billion over a decade or so, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The money could be used to accelerate a landing on the Moon by four years or bolster research programs that would otherwise be cut.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a radical change would, of course, be hard to stomach, even if international partners agreed. Many members of Congress would be outraged by the potential job loss, and NASA itself would be hurt over the long run if it had to let go all the scientists and engineers who are currently working on the shuttle and space station and will be needed later for the Mars project and others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But right now we should at minimum be hearing administrators explain how they will plan for the lowest number of shuttle flights possible, while they work on development of a successor spacecraft and automated vehicles to carry loads into orbit. Even better would be some signs that NASA is thinking boldly as it looks for a way out of this morass -- to free up resources for more exciting explorations.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's smooth landing of the shuttle Discovery ended a flight that was successful in almost every respect but one: the dislodging of a big chunk of foam, like the one that doomed the Columbia. This flight was supposed to vault the shuttle fleet back into space after a prolonged grounding for repairs. But given the repeat of the very problem that two years of retooling was supposed to resolve, the verdict is necessarily mixed. Once again, the space agency has been forced to suspend further flights until it can find a fix for the foam-shedding, and no one seems willing to guess how long that may take.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery astronauts performed superbly during their two-week mission, and the shuttle looked better than ever in some respects. Space officials were justifiably jubilant that so much had gone well, despite daily hand-wringing over possible perils. The flight clearly achieved its prime objectives.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts transferred tons of cargo to the international space station, which has been limping along overhead with a reduced crew and limited supplies carried up on smaller Russian spacecraft. They replaced a broken gyroscope, repaired another and carted away a load of trash that had accumulated on the station, showing the shuttle can bring substantial loads back down from space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the most scrutinized shuttle flight ever, with the vehicle undergoing close inspection while still in orbit. New sensing and photographic equipment to look for potentially perilous damage to the sensitive external skin proved valuable. A new back flip maneuver allowed station astronauts to photograph the shuttle's underbelly, and an extra-long robotic arm enabled astronauts to see parts of the shuttle that were previously out of sight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flood of images and NASA's openness in discussing its uncertainties about potential hazards sometimes made it appear that the shuttle was about to fall apart. In the end the damage was clearly tolerable. A much-touted spacewalk to repair the shuttle's skin -- the first of its kind -- moved an astronaut close enough to pluck out some protruding material with his hand. Preliminary evidence indicates that Discovery has far fewer nicks and gouges than shuttles on previous flights, perhaps showing that improvements to reduce the shedding of debris from the external fuel tank have had some success.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest concern was the nearly one-pound piece of foam that fell off the external tank during liftoff and several other pieces of foam debris that exceeded NASA's size limit. NASA has not yet solved the foam-shedding problem, which it claimed to have largely fixed during the long grounding for repairs. Successful as it was, this flight and the visible uncertainties of its managers left the unsettling impression that there is a lot NASA doesn't know about the performance of the spacecraft it has relied on for the past quarter-century.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even accepting for the sake of argument that the mission is, as the NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, put it on Friday, ''magnificent,'' the shuttle returns to a realm of enormous uncertainty. NASA cannot yet say when shuttles will fly again, or how many missions can be flown before the 2010 retirement date that the Bush administration has set for the shuttle. Designs for follow-on vehicles are taking shape, but are still vague -- and the president's plan to use those new craft for missions to return to the moon and go beyond are even more so.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary goals of Discovery's mission -- resupplying the space station and testing the cameras and sensors that let NASA truly measure the extent of launch debris for the first  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">time -- were accomplished handily by the commander, Col. Eileen M. Collins, and her crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, it has been a mission with high and low points. Discovery's external tank shed so much less debris than earlier ones that the shuttle had just 25 scars on its tiles, onesixth  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">of the usual amount. But the largest chunk of foam, at 0.9 pounds, was more than enough to cause another catastrophe if it had fallen at an earlier point in the ascent and hit the vehicle; NASA officials announced that no shuttle could fly again until the problem was fixed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also the dangling strips of cloth called gap fillers that might have led to damaging heat during re-entry. To remove that threat, NASA ordered the first-ever spacewalk to the underside of the shuttle. The astronaut Steven K. Robinson plucked the offending bits of rigid cloth from between the tiles with ease. But mission managers decided against a spacewalk to correct an insulating blanket that had puffed out from a spot near the commander's window. The engineers could not come up with a fix they had confidence in, and which made it worth  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the risk of a spacewalk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery is scheduled to glide to the ground as early as 4:46 a.m. Eastern time Monday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The time is dictated by the way the shuttle's orbit brings it in line with the approach to Cape Canaveral; if necessary, a second opportunity will come slightly later in the morning, at 6:21.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the weather does not bode well for landing in Florida on Monday, NASA managers will consider two additional landing sites for Tuesday -- Edwards Air Force Base in California  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">or the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The strong preference is for a Florida landing, however, since the shuttle does not need to be ferried to Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a briefing on Saturday, the deputy manager of the shuttle program, N. Wayne Hale, said mission managers believed that the return would be safe but that if a landing at Edwards  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">was necessary they would adjust the shuttle's orbit to avoid flying over Los Angeles. Current weather predictions for Florida, he said, are ''about as good a forecast as you're going to get.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still risks in re-entry, where the fiery plunge into the atmosphere exposes surfaces of the craft to thousands of degrees of heating. NASA hands say they were not always deeply concerned about this leg of the mission, however.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly, de-orbit was considered, for lack of a better word, a less risky part of flight than ascent,'' said John Ira Petty, a spokesman for NASA, ''until Columbia.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The descent gives few clues of its progress. By comparison, the launching has milestones that help observers mark the progress past the various dangerous stages: the solid rocket  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">boosters break away from the shuttle after two minutes, and the external tank separates at eight and a half minutes. Moment by moment, the spectators' tension eases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said at the news conference Friday that descent was different: ''We don't have those kind of milestones,'' he said. ''We just have to go through  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">it and see how it comes out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why he has warned that the risks of space flight do not end until the mission does. On NBC's ''Meet the Press'' last Sunday he was asked, ''When will you be absolutely confident  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">that it's safe for Discovery to return home?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin wryly replied, ''When Eileen has Discovery stopped on the runway and is ready to be towed off.'' He added, ''There is no elimination of all risk.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, with the return in sight, the shuttle families, mission managers and NASA officials are beginning to talk about what to do when it is all over. Pat Youngs, Colonel Collins's husband, says his wife has told him in several e-mail messages from space what she wants when she gets home: Mexican food. ''She's an enchilada fan,'' said Mr. Youngs, who is a commercial pilot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a briefing for reporters on Friday morning, Paul Hill, the lead flight director for the mission, was asked how he might celebrate. ''I'll probably shake hands, hug a few people in the control room and go back home to be with my family,'' he said. ''And drink.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Dr. Griffin, who prides himself on maintaining an unemotional mien, when asked the same question, paused briefly. ''I'll smile,'' he said.  </p>

When this object -- a little more than a thousand feet across -- was first discovered last year, astronomers estimated that it had a distant chance of striking Earth in 2029. After closer observation, it seems likely that this asteroid will still pass very near our planet, but without striking it. There is still a possibility, however, that as it swings by it may hit a gravitational ''keyhole,'' shifting its orbit far enough to make it strike Earth in 2036.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the question of whether Apophis deserves to be added to our regular list of doomsday worries, there's the practical matter of whether we can do anything about it. Hollywood heroics -- trying to blast it out of the sky -- might do more harm than good. NASA scientists think they have the technology to safely give it a nudge that might shift the orbit a few thousand feet. The trick is figuring out exactly when the asteroid will be in the exact place where such a modest bump would be effective.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility is to put a radio beacon on the asteroid, as if it were a member of a wolf pack in Yellowstone. That would let astronomers refine their predictions of the asteroid's potential orbit when it next approaches Earth, in 2012-2013. Given NASA's recent success in firing a probe at the comet Temple I, planting a beacon on an asteroid seems doable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't need to be a science-fiction writer to see a curious convergence here -- the approach of a possibly Earthbound asteroid and the emergence of the scientific and technological capacity to cope with it. That, of course, is merely coincidence. Time will tell whether the risk from 99942 Apophis increases or whether it diminishes naturally, its orbit deforming away from harm, in ways that are well within the realm of probability.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Op-Ed article yesterday about the need to take risks in space exploration misstated the year of John Glenn's flight in the Friendship 7 capsule. It was 1962, not 1961.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Aug 04 2005   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston -- TO read and listen to the coverage about the space shuttle, you would think NASA's mission team has taken careless risks with the lives of the seven astronauts who went into space on the Discovery last Tuesday. During the launching, foam fell off the external tank. For the risk-averse, the only acceptable thing to do now is retire the shuttle program immediately and wait for the divine arrival of the next generation of spacecraft. I am disgusted at the lack of courage and common sense this attitude shows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All progress involves risk. Risk is essential to fuel the economic engine of our nation. And risk is essential to renew American's fundamental spirit of discovery so we remain competitive with the rest of the world.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My take on the current mission is very straightforward. The shuttle is in orbit. To a great extent mission managers have given the spacecraft a clean bill of health. Let us remember that this is a test flight. I consider it a remarkably successful test so far.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technical response to the Columbia accident led to a significant reduction in the amount of debris striking this shuttle during launching. Mission managers have said that the external tank shed 80 percent less foam this time than on previous launchings. Only in the news media, apparently, is an 80 percent improvement considered a failure. Rather than quit, we must now try to reduce even more the amount of foam that comes off the tank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instruments and video equipment developed to assess the launching and monitor debris falling from the tank worked superbly. For the first time, the mission team knows what is happening, when it is happening and the flight conditions under which it occurred. This was a major mission objective, and it is an impressive achievement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having spent more than three decades working in the space program, I know that all of the flights of the early days involved some levels of risk. Some of those risks, in hindsight, seem incomprehensible by today's timid standards. If we had quit when we had our first difficulties in Project Mercury, we would have never put John Glenn on the Atlas rocket Friendship 7 in 1961. Two of the previous five Atlas rockets test-fired before Friendship 7 had exploded on liftoff.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Gemini 9, 10 and 11, all in 1966, we had complications with planned spacewalks that placed the astronauts at risk. Rather than cancel the walks, we faced the risks and solved the problems. These set the stage for Gemini 12 later that year, during which Buzz Aldrin spent more than five hours outside the capsule and confirmed to NASA that spacewalks could be considered an operational capability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, this ability enabled astronauts to retrieve satellites and repair and maintain the Hubble space telescope; and during the current mission, spacewalks were used to repair a gyroscope on the International Space Station and will allow the crew to fix some of the damage that occurred during the launching. These are the rewards for the risks we took on those early Gemini flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I understand the tragedy inherent in risk-taking; I witnessed the fire aboard Apollo 1 in 1967 that killed three crew members. It filled us with anger at ourselves and with the resolve to make it right. After the fire we didn't quit; we redesigned the Apollo command module. During the Apollo missions that followed, we were never perfect. But we were determined and competent and that made these missions successful.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I see the same combination of anger, resolve and determination in the space shuttle program today. These people are professionals who understand risk, how to reduce it and how to make that which remains acceptable. Most important, the current mission has demonstrated the maturity of the shuttle team that endured the Columbia disaster and had the guts to persevere. This is the most important aspect of the recovery from the Columbia accident, and is a credit to the great team NASA now has in place, headed by its administrator, Michael Griffin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many nations that wish to surpass us in space. Does the ''quit now'' crowd really believe that abandoning the shuttle and International Space Station is the way to keep America the pre-eminent space-faring nation? Do they really believe that a new spacecraft will come without an engineering challenge or a human toll? The path the naysayers suggest is so out of touch with the American character of perseverance, hard work and discovery that they don't even realize the danger in which they are putting future astronauts -- not to mention our nation.   </p>

But I'm afraid we won't get there unless he comes to the meteor crater here and puts on a spacesuit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crater on this Canadian island 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle is about the closest earthly approximation of the Martian surface, which is why scientists from the Mars Society are roaming it in spacesuits. When I joined them, I quickly learned several lessons about extraterrestrial exploration.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lesson1: Be careful sipping water. I began the extravehicular activity by breaking off the tip of the water tube and flooding my helmet. The mission leader declared me the first drowning fatality on Mars, which was a useful reminder of the perils of sending humans to space. But after my reincarnation, I began to see the offsetting advantages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one afternoon we covered more ground than either of NASA's Rover robots has traveled in two years. The scientists used all-terrain vehicles to cruise the rocky desert looking for signs of life: slivers of green, beds of fossils. When they spotted something, they quickly dismounted and clambered over the rocks to investigate and retrieve samples.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Society scientists have tried using robots to explore here, but the machines took 1,000 times as long as humans to do the work, even when they were getting instantaneous instructions from scientists nearby. On Mars the robots would be much slower. They'd have to wait for radio signals to travel to Earth and back, which could take more than half an hour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we want to explore much of Mars any time soon, we need to send humans, and they need to be in good shape when they land after the six-month flight. If President Bush put on a spacesuit and a backpack and tried climbing to the top of this crater's ridge, or lifting an A.T.V. out of a crevice, he'd see what's wrong with NASA's plans for Mars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades NASA's doctors have been trying to find some physical therapy to mitigate the effects of weightlessness, but astronauts can still barely walk after six months of it. Meanwhile, NASA has largely ignored an obvious alternative: redesign the spaceship instead of the human body. Artificial gravity could be created during the flight to Mars by twirling the ship.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a ship was designed during the 1990's by Robert Zubrin, the president of the Mars Society, but NASA just went on watching astronauts' bones and muscles deteriorate in orbit. The zero-gravity research provided a rationale for its chief programs, the space shuttle and the space station -- which have always been in desperate search of a rationale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Imagine,'' Mr. Zubrin said, ''that Prince Henry the Navigator had sent one ship out in the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles and put sailors there for six months at a time and measured the rate at which they got scurvy -- and that was all he did. That would be ludicrous enough. But now imagine he did that even though it was already known you could cure scurvy by giving the sailors limes.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Henry, the 15th-century Portuguese prince, actually did was to set a goal: reaching India by sea. Instead of paying for never-ending programs that went nowhere -- like the shuttle and the space station that Congress keeps financing at the expense of a Mars mission -- he rewarded mariners who made progress down the African coast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has started to buy into that philosophy by offering a few prizes, like a $250,000 reward for the best new glove for astronauts. But it could think a lot bigger: prizes to any public or private groups that build a Mars A.T.V., Mars rocket or Mars spaceship. Even if NASA won't spring for the prizes, there's no reason someone else couldn't afford the tab. The 19th-century British Navy, bound by the same kind of bureaucracy and politics as NASA, foundered in its search for the Northwest Passage and the North Pole because its huge ships got trapped in the ice near here. But explorers like Roald Amundsen and Robert Peary had much better luck with small expeditions financed privately.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peary had a millionaires' club that paid for his treks toward the North Pole. Mars is a tougher mission, but Mr. Zubrin figures he could get there within a decade for less than $10 billion, a sum that doesn't even require a club of billionaires, when you consider the fortunes of a Paul Allen or a Bill Gates. One angel would be enough to pay for this flight.   </p>

There was, he said, just no good scientific rationale for considering either of those distant bodies in the same league as the eight indisputable planets that circle the Sun at closer range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Dr. Brown has found something orbiting the Sun that's bigger than Pluto and even farther away. He's changed his mind and proposed that Pluto keep its designation, and that the new object, an extremely big lump of ice and rock, should also be deemed a planet. There is still no good scientific rationale for the judgment, he admitted, but this is a case where habit -- 75 years of calling Pluto a planet -- should trump any scientific definition.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no real debate that the four terrestrial planets -- Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars -- and the four gaseous giants -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- deserve their status as planets. But scientists have long been uneasy about including Pluto, an icy ball smaller than our Moon, whose orbit is more eccentric than the others and tilts in a different plane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try as they might, scientists could not come up with a definition that would retain Pluto as a planet without requiring that scads of other objects be deemed planets as well. Nor could they satisfy the legions of space enthusiasts who remain certain from their grade school lessons that there are nine planets -- no more, no less.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now Dr. Brown proposes that scientists give up the battle and accept a cultural definition of what a planet is. It's either the nine planets we learned about in grade school, or those nine plus any new-found object orbiting the Sun that turns out to be bigger than Pluto. He opts for the latter approach on the theory that most people, deep down, accept that definition. This definition would also, of course, qualify Dr. Brown for the historical footnotes as the discoverer of a new planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our own preference is to take a cleaner way out by dropping Pluto from the planetary ranks. Scientists may well discover many more ice balls bigger than Pluto, and it's a safe bet that few in our culture want to memorize the names of 20 or more planets. Far better to downgrade Pluto to the status of an icy sphere that was once mistakenly deemed a planet because we had not yet discovered its compatriots on the dark fringes of the solar system.   </p>

This is a strange exercise, but it is easier to explain than the shuttle's mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Marsonauts, as these unpaid scientists call themselves, have been tromping around in spacesuits to dig up fossils and look for other signs of life in a huge meteor crater that may be the most Mars-like bit of real estate on this planet.   </p>

The astronauts' primary mission is to discover, with the aid of new cameras trained on the shuttle, whether it's safe for them to be up there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer was clear well before the latest bits of foam fell off. Sending astronauts on the shuttle isn't worth the risk, and not simply because of its design flaws. For all its problems, the shuttles have safely returned from 98 percent of their missions, which may well be the highest success rate of any exploration program in history.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real problem with this exploration program is that it doesn't explore anything. Three decades after going to the Moon, NASA is sending astronauts a few hundred miles above Earth to conduct high school science experiments. Can you name anything -- besides repairing the Hubble Telescope -- they've accomplished?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've delivered cargo and people to the space station, but that could be done far more cheaply and safely with old-fashioned rockets and capsules. Phasing out the shuttle quickly would be painful for the armies of government and aerospace-industry workers who've made a career out of it, but it would liberate NASA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of striving to produce a foolproof short-haul truck, NASA could try looking at space travel the way the Marsonauts do. They're not obsessed with worry about a little foam falling off their ship.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Marsonauts are sticklers for staying ''in sim,'' simulating every inconvenience they can imagine on Mars. No venturing outside the Hab without at least half an hour of preparation: putting on a spacesuit and helmet, wiring a radio, and going through five minutes of decompression in the airlock. No removing a glove to dig for a fossil. No food or bathroom breaks in the field.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have their own jargon (''HabCom, EVA11 is ready to begin its egress de-co'') and their own bureaucracy. Reports are filed nightly to Mission Support and the Remote Science Team, a group of researchers on three continents who are referred to as ''the scientists back on Earth.'' There's even a Martian tricolor -- a red, green and blue flag flapping above the Hab to symbolize their plans to ''terraform'' Mars into a green planet with liquid water and a breathable atmosphere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know this all sounds silly. I arrived sympathetic to the Marsonauts' cause, but ready to write a wryly detached column on an amusing bunch of zealots. Their fantasy sounded like a futurist version of explornography: the simulation of exploration by people trekking through terra cognita on adventure vacations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Marsonauts are really figuring out how to explore the unknown, how to look for life in a place worth risking lives to reach. By the second day here, I was caught up in the sim, too. As we returned to our home on the edge of the crater, the white Hab up on the rocky brown ridge looked like a spaceship on Mars, and the sight was a bigger thrill than anything that's lifted off from Cape Canaveral in a long time.   </p>
