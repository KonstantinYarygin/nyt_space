<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, hours after arriving on Jupiter, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Juno spacecraft had already been flung by the planet's immense gravity onto the outward leg of its orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the plan, of course. The spacecraft arrived on Monday night, diving through intense barrages of radiation and reaching 130,000 miles per hour as it passed 2,900 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno fired its main engine for 35 minutes, slowing it down just enough to be captured by Jupiter's gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything executed just like we designed it to,'' Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager, said in an interview. ''It's doing very well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spacecraft sped around Jupiter, the team at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> spent much of Tuesday eliminating its wobbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, Juno cartwheels as it flies, which helps stabilize the spacecraft. The firing of the main engine can induce slight wobbles because of fuel left in the tanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission controllers can compensate by adjusting the positions of Juno's three 30-foot-long solar panels, much as a skater can adjust her spinning speed by pulling in her arms or extending them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the realignment is complete, the spacecraft will resume communications via its main antenna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This brief lull gives scientists and engineers time to catch their breath after Juno's suspenseful but flawless arrival and before work begins to peer deep inside Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission scientists will be looking for clues that might tell how the planets came together in the early history of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the gateway to being that much closer to getting this really tantalizing science data,'' Mr. Nybakken said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took five years for Juno to travel this far on its $1.1 billion mission, and the spacecraft is to make 37 orbits around Jupiter over the next 20 months. The science instruments, which were turned off for the arrival, will be restarted on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after its close encounter with the gas giant on Monday night, Juno is already too far away to make precise measurements: As of Tuesday afternoon, it was 700,000 miles from Jupiter and speeding away at 30,000 m.p.h.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno will swing back around on a 53-day highly elliptical orbit and make another close pass over Jupiter on Aug. 27, the first time the camera and science instruments will gather eagerly awaited data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno will fire its engine again on Oct. 19 to move to a 14-day orbit, when the science measurements begin in earnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slight discrepancies in Juno's radio signals will reveal minute variations in Jupiter's gravitational field. From that data, scientists hope to figure out if there is a rocky core inside the gas giant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnetic fields measurements will give hints of the churning electric currents deep inside the planet. Microwave emissions will tell researchers about the temperatures and the concentrations of any water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that information will yield clues about whether Jupiter formed where it is now or farther out in the solar system, then migrated to its current orbit. Because Jupiter is the biggest planet and formed first, the information will also tell scientists about the cosmic leftovers that coalesced into the solar system's other planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno's data will also provide insights into the meteorology of Jupiter's colorful bands of clouds and will help explain how the Great Red Spot has persisted for centuries -- and perhaps why it is now shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday night, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists released a video of images taken by Juno as it approached Jupiter, showing the dance of the planet's four large moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even these early photos hint at scientific mysteries. Callisto, for instance, is unexpectedly dim. ''We don't know why,'' Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator, said during a news conference after Juno's arrival. ''We'll have to figure it out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a different vantage on a polar orbit, the spacecraft's cameras are likely to add to the number of Jupiter's known moons, now 67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Juno is really searching for some hints about our beginnings, how everything started,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But these secrets are pretty well guarded by Jupiter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assault of radiation each time Juno zooms past Jupiter will take its toll on the electronics. As the mission progresses, the spacecraft will pass through increasingly violent parts of the radiation belts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 20, 2018, during the 37th orbit, Juno is to make a suicidal dive into Jupiter, ending the mission the same way that Galileo, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s previous Jupiter orbiter, was disposed of in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will ensure that there is no possibility of Juno's crashing into Europa and contaminating it with microbial hitchhikers from Earth. The moon is regarded as one of the likelier places for life elsewhere in the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Juno mission so far is the latest in a string of successes for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, including the flyby of Pluto a year ago by the New Horizons spacecraft and the landing of the car-size Curiosity rover on Mars in 2012.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe countdown for the Juno spacecraft to reach its destination at Jupiter is now a matter of hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Happy Fourth of July, everyone,'' Scott Bolton, the principal investigator of the mission, said during a news conference on Monday. ''That's my favorite holiday. And I think this is my favorite Fourth of July that I've ever had.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space enthusiasts and scientists have eagerly been awaiting this point in Juno's five-year journey, the first solar-powered spacecraft to travel this far from the sun. If the explorer successfully latches onto Jupiter's gravity, it will be only the second time that a probe has gone into orbit around the giant planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're barreling down on Jupiter really quick,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA Television will begin coverage at 10:30 p.m Eastern time. The crucial moment will be the end of the engine burn, at 11:53 p.m..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bolton said even then he would not feel at ease, not until Juno's expansive 30-foot-long solar arrays are pointed back at the sun, crucial for a spacecraft that is relying on sunlight for power. ''The whole game is, get back to the sun before you run out of battery,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of the sun, Jupiter is bigger than everything in the solar system put together. But little is known about the interior beneath its colorful cloud stripes. Juno will orbit it 37 times over the next 20 months, with the hopes that it will collect data and images that offer clues to the origins of our solar system and the formation of the planets and moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mysteries of Jupiter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several spacecraft have flown past Jupiter, beginning with Pioneer 10 in 1973. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Galileo spacecraft, entering orbit in 1995, dropped a 750-pound probe into Jupiter's atmosphere, sending back data that showed Jupiter had strong, turbulent winds and offering details about the composition of its atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its eight years at Jupiter, Galileo confirmed ideas of how Jupiter's diaphanous rings formed out of dust particles blasted off Jupiter's small inner moons. It measured the sizzling 2,800-degree temperatures of volcanoes on Io, one of the planet's four large moons, and it found evidence of under-ice oceans on the other three moons of Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Galileo, Juno will be in an orbit passing over Jupiter's poles, providing a first close look at those regions. With repeated close passes over the cloud tops, the spacecraft will measure microwave emissions, the gravity field and the magnetic field, offering glimpses into what is deep inside Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Search for Water</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might seem odd to care about the water on Jupiter, but it is one of the main issues that Juno scientists are focusing on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's in some ways our premier measurement,'' said Steven Levin, the mission's project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mars, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s strategy seeks to find out whether there was water there that would have ever made Mars cozy enough for life. Jupiter, with its crushing gravity and ultra-intense radiation, clearly is not a hospitable place for life, but that's not why scientists are interested about water there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, the question is, ''Where's the oxygen?'' Jupiter has greater concentrations than the sun of most of the heavier elements like nitrogen and carbon, except for oxygen, which is scarce. Thus, scientists expect that oxygen atoms have each been tied up with two hydrogens to form water molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measurements collected by Juno of microwave emissions emanating out of Jupiter will tell both the temperature and how much water there is, because water molecules absorb microwaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Juno finds a lot of water, that suggests Jupiter formed farther from the sun in the colder, icier regions and later migrated to its current orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does Jupiter have more of the heavier elements, anyway? That's a mystery, too. One hypothesis is that the heavier elements came from comets that crashed into Jupiter and it absorbed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Heart of the Matter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Jupiter have a rocky core at its center?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measuring Jupiter's gravity field will tell the distribution of mass within. If there is a rocky core, planetary scientists will have to explain how rocky bodies formed that early in the solar system. If there is not, then Jupiter formed out of a collapse of a gas cloud, much as the sun did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mysteries of Metallic Hydrogen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter is almost entirely hydrogen and helium, the two simplest and most abundant elements in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cool these two gases, and they change to a liquid. Inside Jupiter, hydrogen is believed to undergo another transformation, to a metal. Scientists have not been able to recreate metallic hydrogen on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In laboratory experiments, hydrogen, squeezed to tens of millions of pounds per square inch between two diamonds, has remained stubbornly nonmetallic. The pressure inside Jupiter is hundreds of millions of pounds per square inch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By studying Jupiter's magnetic fields, probably generated by currents of metallic hydrogen, scientists will receive hints about the properties of this elusive substance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm confident it's going to work,'' Dr. Bolton said, ''but I'll be happy when it's over and we're in orbit,''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the ways that this could turn into a bad day:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno blows up. In August 1993, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s instrument-packed Mars Observer spacecraft vanished. An inquiry concluded that a fuel leak caused the spacecraft to spin quickly and fall out of communication. While Juno's setup is different, there is always a chance of an explosion with rocket fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engine doesn't fire at all. The Japanese probe Akatsuki was all set to arrive at Venus in December 2010, but its engine didn't fire, and Akatsuki sailed right past Venus. Last year, Akatsuki crossed paths with Venus again, and this time, using smaller thrusters, it was able to enter orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It crashes into something. Jupiter does not possess the majestic rings of Saturn, but it does have a thin ring of debris orbiting it. Juno will pass through a region that appears clear, but that does not mean it actually is. Even a dust particle could cause significant damage, as Juno will be moving at a speed of 132,000 miles per hour relative to Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It flies too close to Jupiter and is ripped to pieces. In one of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s most embarrassing failures, the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft, was lost in 1999 because of a mix-up between English and metric units. Climate Orbiter went far deeper into Mars' atmosphere than planned. On its first orbit, Juno is to pass within 2,900 miles of Jupiter's cloud tops, so a miscalculation could be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computer crashes. On July 4 last year, the mission controllers of the New Horizons spacecraft that was about to fly by Pluto experienced some nervous moments when the spacecraft stopped talking to them. The computer on New Horizons crashed while trying to interpret some new commands and compressing some images it had taken, the electronic equivalent of walking while chewing gum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controllers put New Horizons back in working order within a few days, and the flyby occurred without a hitch. For Juno, the scientific instruments have been turned off for its arrival at Jupiter. ''We turn off everything that is not necessary for making the event work,'' said Dr. Levin, the project scientist. ''This is very important to get right, so you don't do anything extra.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intense barrage of radiation at Jupiter could knock out Juno's computer, even though it is shielded in a titanium vault. Usually, when there is a glitch, a spacecraft goes into ''safe mode'' to await new instructions from Earth, but in this case, that would be too late to save Juno. The spacecraft has been programmed to automatically restart the engine to allow it to enter orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If that doesn't go just right, we fly past Jupiter, and of course, that's not desirable,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Final Hours of the Approach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno has been executing an automated sequence of actions since Thursday. A timeline of what Juno will be doing (all Eastern time):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9:13 p.m. Start of transmission of single frequency ''tones'' that will provide updates on the spacecraft's condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9:16 p.m. Juno begins turning away from the sun to position the engine in the right direction to slow the spacecraft for its arrival at Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10:41 p.m. With the main antenna pointing away from the sun, Juno switches to a smaller antenna for sending the tones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10:45 p.m. Juno adjusts itself to eliminate any wobbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10:56 p.m. Juno speeds up its spin rate from two rotations a minute to five rotations a minute, a process that takes about five minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11:18 p.m. The main engine begins firing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11:38 p.m. The spacecraft has slowed down enough to be captured into orbit around Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11:53 p.m. The main engine shuts off, leaving Juno in the desired orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11:55 p.m. The spacecraft starts slowing its spin rate back down to two revolutions per minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12:07 a.m. Tuesday Juno changes direction to point its antenna back at Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12:11 a.m. Juno ends the transmission of status tones and switches to its medium-gain antenna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12:16 a.m. Juno begins transmitting detailed telemetry, although it may take 20 minutes or longer to lock into the signal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Happens Next?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first two highly elliptical orbits will be 53 days in duration, lasting until mid-October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Juno will fire its engine again on Oct. 19 to move to a 14-day orbit when the science measurements begin in earnest. Three 30-foot solar panels provide a mere 500 watts to power Juno and its instruments. On Nov. 3, people will be able to start voting on where Juno should point its camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 37th orbit, on Feb. 20, 2018, Juno is to make a suicidal dive into Jupiter, ending the mission, the same way that the Galileo spacecraft was disposed in 2003. That is to ensure there is no possibility that Juno would crash into Europa and contaminate it with microbial hitchhikers from Earth. Europa is regarded as one of the most likely places in the solar system to look for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why Only 20 Months in Orbit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took five years to get to Jupiter, and the mission costs $1.1 billion, yet Juno will have a far shorter stay than the eight years Galileo spent exploring Jupiter in the moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The close approaches to Jupiter means Juno will pass through intense bombardment of the radiation belts. As the mission progresses, Juno's orbits will receive more direct hits of radiation. In the best outcome, the mission might be extended for a few months. But over time, the spacecraft's electronics will fail.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan G. Finley began working on rockets before <span class="companylink">NASA</span> existed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now at age 79, instead of watching fireworks on the Fourth of July, she will be at her post in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., waiting for confirmation that the latest of its space adventures has succeeded.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Finley, an engineering specialist for the Deep Space Network of radio telescopes, will monitor radio signals, waiting for one critical beep -- a signal sent from Juno, the solar-powered planetary explorer -- that announces it has finally reached Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, after a five-year journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a hard signal to track,'' Ms. Finley said. ''We do think it's going to work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If everything goes right, her computer will pluck tones out of the data sent by Juno and received by an array of four radio telescopes in Canberra, Australia. Those tones will be translated and displayed as 36 reassuring messages over four hours. ''It has real words in it about what's happening,'' Ms. Finley said. While agency officials will want to know what the tones mean in real time, Ms. Finley said the signals are often most important when something goes awry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tones are useful when a spacecraft's main antenna is not pointed at Earth, as is the case with Juno during the phase in which it fires its engine to get captured by Jupiter's gravity. The smaller, weaker antenna can transmit only simple tones as communication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a far different job from one Ms. Finley had in January 1958 when she first walked into the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. One of the female space pioneers featured in the book ''Rise of the Rocket Girls'' by Nathalia Holt, Ms. Finley started just before the launch of Explorer I, the first satellite that the United States successfully sent into space. Six months later, Congress passed the law creating <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, and at the end of year, the laboratory, which had been performing rocketry work for the Army, was transferred to the space agency to focus on sending robotic probes to explore the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Finley was not an engineer. In college, she aspired to become an architect, but dropped out after three years. ''I couldn't learn art,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had taken some mathematics classes and, with an affinity for numbers, she literally became a human computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electronic computers were still rare and expensive, so engineers -- invariably men back then -- handed off the equations they needed to have solved to a computer, almost always a female employee. Ms. Finley computed, first at Convair, an aeronautics company in Pomona, Calif., then at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You just wrote across the top a step-by-step breakdown of how to use the numbers and then down the other side were the numbers you were going to have to try,'' Ms. Finley recalled. ''You just went across, plugging in and clanking away. And then at the end, you gave them the piece of paper with all the answers on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the work appeared to be tedious, ''if you liked puzzles and things like that, it was fun,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And you always got an answer,'' she said, ''unlike a lot of problems in the world that there are no answers to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She left for six years to raise two sons until the younger one entered nursery school, and then returned in 1969, picking up computer programming and becoming an engineer. ''Being a programmer is more fun than being a computer,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, she also worked as a test engineer and then an engineer on the Deep Space Network. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> used the simple tones technique in landing Mars Pathfinder in 1997. But it left them out for two later Mars spacecraft, Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander, which were both lost in 1999. Investigations into what went wrong were hampered without the data supplied by the tones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> resumed using the tones for its next Mars mission, two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004. For the Spirit landing, Ms. Finley went to the Goldstone observatory in California, part of the Deep Space Network, to process the tones as Spirit bounded to the surface of Mars inside a cocoon of airbags. (Back then, the engineers did not trust the internet to reliably convey the signals to mission control.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last moments of the landing, the tones dropped out. ''A lot people were worried for 15 minutes,'' Ms. Finley recalled, although she was not one of the worriers. ''I knew I had seen it bouncing. I knew it had landed O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers had taken into account the shift in frequencies because of changing velocities of the spacecraft as it descended. They had assumed that once on the ground, Spirit's transmitter would send a steady signal back. But the frequency drifted as the transmitter warmed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found it,'' Ms. Finley said. ''It was there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To this point, the tones appear to be good luck. All of the missions that have used them have succeeded, Ms. Finley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout much of her career, which spans more than five decades, Ms. Finley was classified as an engineer, a point of pride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a laboratory-wide review of jobs and pay in 2008 altered her employment status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We redesigned our entire compensation structure and all disciplines were reviewed and updated to accurately describe employee duties and responsibilities,'' said Veronica McGregor, a laboratory spokeswoman, in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An explanatory memo the laboratory distributed when the changes were revealed said that ''a four-year college degree in engineering, science or similar technical field is required to be classified as an engineer, consistent with industry and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Ms. Finley, who never finished her degree, fell into a newly created classification: engineering specialist, an hourly position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her overall pay did not change, and she is now eligible for overtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She retained her same salary and standing,'' Ms. McGregor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the change still irks Ms. Finley; she must mark down her arrival each day, her half-hour of lunch and the time she leaves to go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a demotion,'' she said. ''No one wants a demotion. We want to be treated like we deserve. But it's true. I don't have a degree.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''I think I'm kind of smart, maybe.'' Finishing a degree was not an option. ''I just hate school,'' she said. ''I love work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Juno is in orbit around Jupiter, with its big antenna pointing at Earth, it will no longer be sending tones but complex data about the planet's interior during its 20-month stint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Finley will return to her usual duties, with no plans to retire. When the next rover lands on Mars in 2021 -- sending out its tones -- she hopes to be back at her post.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before the spacecraft Juno finishes a five-year trip to Jupiter on Monday, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has decided to extend the missions of nine older robotic explorers that have lived beyond original expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency announced the decision on Friday, saying the nine are still producing bounties of observations for scientists.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the extensions were expected. The New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto last year, had already been steered toward a new target, known as 2014 MU69, one of the small icy objects in the ring of debris beyond Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s decisions, about the Dawn spacecraft orbiting Ceres, the dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, was somewhat of a surprise -- as well as a disappointment to some working on the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a bit unexpected because Dawn is low on fuel. ''Less than a year ago, I would have thought it was ridiculous that the spacecraft would even be operating at this point,'' said Marc D. Rayman, the chief engineer for the Dawn mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dawn spacecraft was designed to use four spinning wheels to pivot in different directions. But at its previous destination, the asteroid Vesta, two of the four wheels overheated and failed. At Ceres, the wheels stayed off, and the spacecraft used its thrusters instead to pivot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Dawn reached its lowest orbit, just 240 miles above Ceres. Dr. Rayman said he and his team had expected Dawn to exhaust its remaining propellant by March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they spun up the wheels again. That succeeded, cutting the use of the thrusters. ''It all worked out beautifully,'' Dr. Rayman said. That left enough fuel to contemplate doing something more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Dr. Rayman's blog made a stunning announcement: Dawn would leave Ceres and head toward a flyby of a third asteroid, Adeona, in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The posting was yanked. A member of Dawn's social media team had mistakenly published an unfinished draft that Dr. Rayman had started writing in case <span class="companylink">NASA</span> selected that course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, around noon, Dr. Rayman received word from officials at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> headquarters that they had decided on the other option proffered by the Dawn team: Dawn will stay where it is, continuing observations of Ceres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rayman said Dawn could continue until next spring, as long as the spinning wheels kept working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The long-term monitoring of Ceres, particularly as it gets closer to perihelion -- the part of its orbit with the shortest distance to the sun -- has the potential to provide more significant science discoveries than a flyby of Adeona,'' James L. Green, NASA's director of planetary science, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rayman said he did not have a preference. But the mission's principal investigator, Christopher T. Russell, said he was disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Almost every time when you are doing exploration, a new path is going to provide more return on your investment (time or money) than continuing to repeat the old well-worn path,'' Dr. Russell, a professor of geophysics and space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nevertheless, given that we were told to stay at Ceres, we will continue our exploration of Ceres and do our best possible work in the time we have remaining,'' he said. ''There is still science that can be done here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other missions receiving extensions are the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and a flotilla of spacecraft at Mars: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, the Mars Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, the Mars Odyssey orbiter, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s support for the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Mars Express mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials periodically ask managers of the long-lived missions to justify the cost of their continued operations. Final decisions depend on whether <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has enough money in its budget for all of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Juno will be on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s center stage as it begins 20 months of orbiting Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Juno spacecraft closes in for its Monday arrival at Jupiter, many other eyes are also staring at the solar system's largest planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from about 25 observatories -- including some of the largest on Earth, like the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and in orbit around Earth, like the Hubble Space Telescope -- will aid scientists in interpreting the data that Juno is expected to gather as it swoops close to the cloud tops of Jupiter over the next 20 months.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has taken Juno nearly five years to reach this point in its journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In just a few days, we're about to arrive at Jupiter, and it's hard to believe,'' Scott Bolton, the mission's principal investigator, said at a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around last Friday, Juno crossed from interplanetary space into the magnetic bubble surrounding Jupiter that deflects the stream of particles from the sun known as the solar wind. ''Inside that magnetosphere is Jupiter's domain that's filled with its particles,'' Dr. Bolton said. ''It has blocked out the sun's particles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Juno's instruments measures radio emissions from the charged particles, and those radio waves are easily converted into sound waves, which sharply changed in tone as the spacecraft crossed the ''bow shock,'' where Jupiter's magnetic field plows through the solar wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Data Recorded as Juno Crossed Jovian Bow Shock Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just the sound of it can tell you it's nontrivial to go into Jupiter,'' Dr. Bolton said, as <span class="companylink">NASA</span> released the recording of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of days ago, the propulsion system was pressurized in preparation for the firing of the spacecraft's engine, which will take 35 minutes on Monday. On Thursday, the last set of instructions before the arrival was sent to Juno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then it'll be hands-off from the team,'' said Edward Hirst, the mission manager. ''The spacecraft is on its own, and it's designed to take care of itself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When in orbit, Juno's instruments will be able to peer deep into Jupiter, but only for a narrow swath. The faraway observations by telescopes will ''fill in the blanks to get the big-picture story,'' Leigh Fletcher, of the <span class="companylink">University of Leicester</span> in England, said in an interview. ''We'll have the best observational data set of Jupiter that we've ever had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Dr. Fletcher and his colleagues released infrared photographs of Jupiter seemingly on fire. ''You can see the internal glow of Jupiter coming out,'' Dr. Fletcher said. ''Those clouds are colder and are absorbing in the infrared.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Juno begins orbiting Jupiter, each time that the spacecraft zips in close, the team will take similar photographs using the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span>'s Very Large Telescope in Chile ''to place the Juno close-up observations in their broader spatial context.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Dr. Fletcher said he wanted to piece together Juno's measurements of ammonia and water -- key constituents of Jupiter's clouds -- with the weather patterns seen in the Very Large Telescope pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Juno providing the first good look at Jupiter's poles, Dr. Fletcher is curious as to whether huge hurricane-like storms rage, similar to what has been observed in Saturn's polar regions. The auroras -- glowing patterns powered by charged particles slamming into the atmosphere -- might also affect the weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To gain more data on the auroras, the Hubble Space Telescope has been staring at Jupiter for 45 minutes every day for the past month. At Earth, auroras light up when solar wind particles slam into molecules of air near the polar regions. At Jupiter, the charged particles come mostly from a different source: the volcanos of Io. Jupiter's powerful magnetic fields then accelerate the particles into the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, the auroras are subdued. At other times, they are ''almost like fireworks going off in the ionosphere of Jupiter,'' said Jonathan Nichols, a University of Leicester scientist who is leading the Hubble study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things that is unknown is how much the solar wind contributes to Jupiter's auroras. ''We'll be working on that over the next few weeks and months,'' Dr. Nichols said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, auroras appear over an area about as large as the United States. Jupiter's auroras, like everything else there, are vastly larger, about as wide as five Earths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But we've never been able to get up close and really observe these processes,'' Fran Bagenal, a professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado and one of the mission scientists, said at the news conference. ''So we can then compare them with what we see at Earth, what we seen at Saturn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bagenal said scientists were curious about whether Jovian auroras were simply larger versions of Earth's auroras. ''Or do we have to really go back to the fundamental physics and work out what's really going on here?'' she asked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2004 the probe has twirled around Saturn, studying the gas giant's rings, storms and moons. But it has recently started preparing for next year, when it will plunge into the planet's atmosphere and vaporize.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> chose the ringed planet as Cassini's final resting place because the space agency doesn't want to risk contaminating a potentially habitable world with hardy microbes that may be aboard the craft. Saturn, with its gaseous surface consumed by hydrogen and helium, is inhospitable to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same may not be true for some of its moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titan, the biggest Saturnian satellite, has an atmosphere that is much less hostile than its overlord's. It is a wet world similar to Earth, but unlike our planet, it is awash in methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Methane plays the role on Titan that water plays on Earth,'' said Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ''Methane can be a vapor and form clouds. It can rain methane and that methane can flow into tiny lakes and large seas at the north pole of Titan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini is currently exploring the methane seas and trying to determine if they have waves. Its goal is to detect mirror-like reflections of sunlight off the liquid surface, known as specular reflections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someday we might land a boat on the sea of Titan and make measurements,'' she said. ''You could have very unusual kinds of life in those seas, life that uses methane instead of water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To protect Titan and other potentially life-bearing places, Cassini's final mission calls for its obliteration. Researchers have dubbed the spacecraft's swan song the ''Cassini Grand Finale'' because it includes an ambitious maneuver: 22 loops through the gap between Saturn's surface and its innermost rings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before launching Cassini, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> drew up plans to dispose of it in Saturn's upper atmosphere, but they only developed its elaborate end-of-mission maneuver in the past couple of years. Once they found that some of Saturn's moons may be potentially habitable to life, keeping the probe clear of them as it ran out of fuel became crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Cassini can thread the needle through the planet's gap, it must first reach the proper angle in its orbit. That means climbing to an inclination of approximately 64 degrees. The problem is that Cassini doesn't have the power to propel itself to that position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fuel tank gauge is on 'E,''' said Dr. Spilker, adding that the probe is in desperate need of a gravity boost. To get one, it will tango with Titan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Imagine Titan as having a giant extra fuel tank,'' Dr. Spilker said. By performing a flyby of the moon, Cassini can swing from one partner to another. ''We can use its energy and gravity to raise the tilt of Cassini's orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month Cassini completed a flyby that raised its inclination from 35 degrees to 42 degrees. It has plans to conduct five more this year before its final mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each of the six will raise the tilt of the orbit a little bit,'' said Dr. Spilker, ''until we get the right orbit to go in between the rings and the planet.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of you asked questions about black holes so profound and clever I couldn't even start to answer them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite a few readers wanted to know what happens at the center of a black hole. Is there a wormhole to another space and time, another universe, another big bang, other dimensions? The short honest answer is that nobody knows. We have no accepted theory of quantum gravity, and that is needed to explain what happens when gravity is very intense and the distances are very short, as in a black hole or the Big Bang. According to Albert Einstein's classical equations of general relativity, the density of matter and energy becomes infinite under such circumstances, but the appearance of infinity in scientific calculations is usually a sign that something is being missed. That's why the work of theorists goes on.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime you are free to imagine anything. And here are some of the great questions I was able to answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions for Beginners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hello Dennis, my name is JJ Hennessy and I am 13 years old. I think the entire realm of black holes is completely fascinating, and I am dying to learn more about them in order to achieve a more fruitful understanding of these mysterious things. Since you are probably going to get a lot of questions about the scientific side of things, I thought I would instead ask you how you became interested in this complex field and where you began your pursuits. -- James Joseph Hennessy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I read too much science fiction when I was about your age, and became fascinated with questions that had to do with the origin and destiny of the universe. I think we all want to know who we are and where we came from. And where this is all going. The idea that science could shed light on questions like this, that the laws of physics predict their own downfall, that matter could just disappear and that space and time could end is just too delicious. That is some powerful magic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I f math is used to understand physics, what is the difference between the two fields, and how do physicists see this differently from mathematicians? -- Amy Sillman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of the great mysteries of nature (I know I have used this phrase a lot) that mathematics works so well to describe physics. The quantum physicist Eugene Wigner referred to the ''unreasonable effectiveness'' of math. Some of it seems miraculous, as when the British physicist Paul Dirac wrote down an equation for the electron in 1928 and found it had two solutions -- one with a negative charge like the electrons we already knew and loved, and the other with a positive charge, which had never been observed but would be. His equations predicted the existence of antimatter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could we possibly detect whether or not a black hole is passing by our solar system? Or worse, how could we detect whether or not our solar system is in the process of being absorbed by a black hole? -- Richard Robinson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like anything in the universe, a black hole would be in motion, orbiting the center of the galaxy for example. Or in the case of the colliding black holes detected by LIGO astronomers earlier this year, orbiting each other. The solar system and planets are also in constant motion. In fact, one lesson of Einstein's relativity is that there is no absolute standard of rest in the universe. If a black hole came by, or we came by it, we would notice its gravity perturbing planets and spacecraft. And if it passed in front of, say Saturn, we would see the planet and its rings warped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intermediate Questions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could someone briefly (from their perspective) orbit a supermassive black hole (with an event horizon with a huge radius) and thereby ''jump'' millions of years into the future? -- Michael Barnes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes. As dramatized in the movie ''Interstellar,'' time seems to slow down for someone deep in a powerful gravitational field. So you could get close to a big black hole and what would seem like a few hours to you would be thousands of years to an outside observer far away. This is in fact the basis of ''Icarus at the Edge of Time,'' a book and film by Brian Greene, the <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> physicist and World Science Festival impresario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could black holes be the seeds of galaxies? -- Jack Aitken</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is indeed true that, as far as we know, every large galaxy harbors one or more supermassive black holes -- weighing in at millions or even billions of times more massive than the sun -- in its heart. Moreover, there seems to be a rough correlation between the masses of these black holes and the masses of the galaxies in which they live. The bigger the galaxy, the bigger its black hole. How this comes about is a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">W hat determines the life span of a black hole, and have we been able to record the final explosion of one? -- Coenraad van der Poel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have never seen a black hole explode. So far. According to Stephen Hawking's math, the temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. So the smaller it is, the hotter it should be. For normal astrophysical objects this would be negligible. A black hole as massive as the sun would radiate with a temperature of about 60 billionths of a Kelvin -- colder than you'll ever be. We would not notice it -- now. But this is a runaway process. As a black hole of this size radiates, it shrinks slightly and thus gets hotter, which makes it shrink faster and hotter, and so forth almost until the end of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a billion-ton black hole ( about the size of a small asteroid) that might have squeezed into existence from the enormous pressure of the Big Bang would be blazing hot today, spewing gamma rays at a temperature of 100 billion degrees. Astronomers have surveyed the sky looking for evidence of these, but haven't found any. Which doesn't mean they do not exist. They could be too far away or too few in number to stick out above the background noises of the universe and register on our devices here at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advanced Questions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have always been thrilled by the quantum physics concept of particle entanglement. ''Spooky action at a distance,'' to paraphrase Einstein, allows for two entangled particles to ''inform'' one another without being physically connected. This property is not just theoretical but is being proven at ever-increasing distances. If one entangled particle went into a black hole, could we get information out of the black hole by watching the other entangled particle that was not in the black hole? -- Noah Arthur Bardach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a scary good question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That not only can happen, but it is apparently required for information to escape from a black hole. Unfortunately, the particle outside the event horizon -- the invisible boundary that is a black hole's point of no return -- also has to be entangled with another particle that has already emerged from the black hole, and the laws of quantum mechanics prohibit such promiscuous arrangements, which leads to a paradox and the possibility that there is a firewall at the edge of a black hole. See my article from a few years ago for an additional explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't understand how astrophysicists talk of mega black holes being formed by swallowing stars. There is nothing to prevent black holes from coalescing but how can you make a black hole larger by swallowing stars when all possible observers are outside? -- Jay Spivack</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">External observers will see anything that falls into a black hole basically freeze at the event horizon. The original term for these objects was ''frozen stars.'' But their gravitational fields are still there, like ghosts of the disappeared star. And so whatever falls into a black hole just adds its own gravity to whatever was there in the first place. So the ''hole'' over time gets bigger as its field increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Didn't Leonard Susskind basically 'win' the black hole war quite some time ago? And, didn't Professor Susskind already indicate that all of the information in a black hole is also revealed on its surface, as indicated by his string theory calculations? -- Lewis Waldman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one reader asked about the absence of Dr. Susskind from my most recent article. I am a great admirer of his work, and it would have been discussed had there been more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Susskind has stressed that there is a deeper problem about information in black holes that soft hair does not solve. Namely there is a famous principle in quantum theory that says information cannot be cloned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can make copies of The New York Times and spread them around, but quantum bits cannot be copied; they have to be one place or another. So a person can't be both on the horizon and inside of it at the same time. An outside observer might think all my information was stored in soft hair on the black hole's horizon, but if I fell into a black hole I would perceive that I am still the same person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing drastic is supposed to happen when you cross the event horizon, according to the Einstein equations. But I can't be in two places at once. So am I in the black hole or spread out on its surface? I have to be one place or the other according to quantum theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My understanding of Hawking Radiation is that quantum foam pops into its normally-evanescent existence right on the event horizon, but before it can dissolve back into nothingness, one part gets sucked in, and the other blasted out into space. What I don't understand is why that causes the black hole to eventually evaporate. (My understanding comes from your great ''Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos.'') -- Stephen Foster</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many ways to visualize a black hole's leaking process. One of my favorites is from Dennis Sciama, Dr. Hawking's mentor, who said that due to quantum uncertainty, the exact location of the event horizon -- the spherical shell in space that delineates the point of no return -- would be uncertain and would fluctuate or wiggle as a result. That wiggling in the strong gravitational field would cost the hole energy, and thus mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hawking himself imagines a pair of virtual particles, which are constantly coming into brief existence on energy borrowed from the gravitational field of the black hole. If one of them falls into the black hole its energy gets returned but the other can then run free, and its energy does not get paid back. As a result the black hole loses a small amount of mass in each such transaction, the way hackers siphon a fraction of a cent at a time from bank transactions can wind up shorting it a fortune.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geologists in Sweden have found what they call the first-ever ''extinct'' meteorite buried within a 470-million-year old limestone slab. The new space rock belongs to a family of meteorites that once bombarded Earth, but no longer plunge to the planet, according to a paper published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No similar meteorite is known on Earth of the 50,000 meteorites that have been found,'' said Birger Schmitz, a geologist from <span class="companylink">Lund University</span> in Sweden, and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half a billion years ago, two asteroids between Jupiter and Mars are believed to have collided, spewing celestial shrapnel across the solar system. Countless pieces flew past Earth, but some crash-landed in its ancient oceans. Following millions of years of sediment buildup and compression, the meteorites fossilized, much like the trilobites and shellfish that shared the seafloor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, miners in a Swedish quarry came across the fossilized meteorites among limestone that was destined to be made into floor panels. At first they began throwing the ugly black rocks into the dump, until a geologist finally got a look at one and realized its significance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 25 years, Dr. Schmitz and his colleagues collected more than 100 fossilized meteorites from the Swedish quarry. They classified all but one as L-chondrites, a common type of meteorite. These space rocks came from the same parent rock and provided evidence for the first asteroid from the collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the team was stumped by the one leftover. The so-called ''mysterious object'' landed on Earth around the same time as the other meteorite fossils, but it had different chemical signatures and grain patterns. All clues indicated that it might have been a new type of meteorite, possibly belonging to the second asteroid from the smash, but the team was skeptical of their findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,'' Dr. Schmitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For four years they studied the 3-inch-wide black rock to find its origins and prove themselves wrong. Instead, what they found only strengthened their theory. The oddball space rock was exposed to identical levels of cosmic rays as the L-chondrites, which indicated that both meteorite types were ejected from their parent asteroids around the same time. Then they analyzed the fossil for isotopes of the elements oxygen and chromium to determine if it had a composition that was similar to any existing meteorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The chromium isotopes are the nail in the coffin,'' Dr. Schmitz said. ''This is really, really strong confirmation that this is something completely different than what is known among meteorites on Earth today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schmitz and his team concluded that the new space rock, which they named Öst 65, came from the asteroid that smashed into the same L-chondrite parent rock that littered the ancient seafloor with debris. They think Öst 65's parent asteroid was annihilated in the collision, which is why they call the meteorite ''extinct,'' because it can never again rain down on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our result gives a hint that the types of meteorites that normally fell on Earth 470 million years ago,'' he said, ''might have been very different from the meteorites that fall to Earth today.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything about this project, called Stratolaunch, screams bigness. The slogan ''Think Big'' is plastered on workers' T-shirts and on posters around the hangar in the desert outside Los Angeles, where the plane is being assembled. The effort is being financed by the jumbo fortune of Paul G. Allen, the billionaire space enthusiast and a <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plane's nickname is Roc, after the gigantic mythical bird that carried an elephant in its talons, though Stratolaunch executives are not crazy about it; it sounds like something not known for staying aloft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rare tour of the plane and hangar last week by executives working for Mr. Allen showed that the project was still underway, and on track to begin commercial operations before the end of the decade. But there are lingering questions about how Stratolaunch's business will work once its flying behemoth is ready for takeoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an incredibly ambitious undertaking,'' said Charles Beames, president of Vulcan Aerospace, the entity Mr. Allen created to oversee Stratolaunch and other space initiatives. ''A really big plane means carrying anything from a really big rocket to a smaller rocket. That allows us to serve a broader set of customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen unveiled Stratolaunch in 2011 with the goal of revolutionizing access to space, mostly for commercial satellite operators hungry for more efficient methods of getting into orbit. Mr. Allen lured the renowned aerospace engineer Burt Rutan out of retirement to help with the project. A decade earlier, Mr. Allen financed Mr. Rutan's efforts to build SpaceShipOne, a rocket-powered plane that in 2004 won the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first private-crewed spacecraft to reach space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stratolaunch bought two used Boeing 747s from <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span>, removed most of their critical parts and is now reassembling them into one carrier plane with a new shell made of lightweight graphite composites. It is hoped that the plane will take off with a rocket slung underneath, which it would then drop from an altitude of more than 30,000 feet, sending it on its way to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other private space ventures, including Blue Origin, funded by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, founded by the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, are trying to reduce the costs of getting into space by operating reusable rockets that launch from and land back on Earth. (On Sunday, Blue Origin conducted another successful test of its New Shepard rocket, launching and landing the same rocket for the fourth time.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stratolaunch executives said an airborne launcher would have other advantages, like the ability to simply fly to patches of clear sky to avoid foul weather that could scrub a mission. They also say their plane can easily move to areas that are better suited for launching satellites into certain orbits, although the plane needs a landing strip that can handle its great size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wingspan of Stratolaunch's airplane stretches 385 feet. A football field could fit on top of the plane's wings and there would still be extra room for a few rows of bleachers. The Spruce Goose, the flying boat designed by Howard Hughes that flew only once, has a wingspan of about 320 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been tumult around aspects of Stratolaunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its partnerships ended with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Orbital ATK</span>. Stratolaunch had worked with them both to develop rockets for blasting satellites into space from the plane. And questions have been raised about whether there would be enough business -- given the trend toward smaller satellites -- for such a large plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Beames said that Stratolaunch, which will be able to carry payloads of over 500,000 pounds, was the right size. ''It's definitely not overbuilt,'' he said. ''What the size gives us is flexibility in payload.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Ostrove, a space systems analyst at Forecast International, an aerospace and defense research firm, says the real demand for Stratolaunch's services will be determined by its ability to serve the small-satellite launch market, which is extremely competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Stratolaunch can figure out its strategy and develop a working rocket, it should be able to capture some business, as long as the small-satellite market continues to grow and demand for launch vehicles continues,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the tour last week, workers with Scaled Composites, the company founded by Mr. Rutan that is building the plane, were positioning panels on the twin fuselages of the plane and grinding surfaces down to a smooth finish. Over 300 people are working on the craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assembly of the plane, inside a cavernous hangar built especially for it, is more than three-quarters finished. The size of the plane is difficult to comprehend. The top of its tail wing is nearly four stories from the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucked away in corners of the hangar are the landing gear components from the two 747s. The new plane will use six of the eight <span class="companylink">Pratt &amp; Whitney</span> engines Stratolaunch acquired when it bought the 747s. The plane's cockpit is being outfitted with electronics, crew seats and windows from the 747s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beames said Stratolaunch would announce new partnerships in the coming months that will fill out details about the project. He declined to say when Stratolaunch would begin test flights, but he vowed to meet a goal of Mr. Allen's to be up and running by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Come hell or high water, you can be sure we'll do that,'' Mr. Beames said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDA new experimental airplane being built by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> could help push electric-powered aviation from a technical curiosity and pipe dream into something that might become commercially viable for small aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference on Friday of the <span class="companylink">American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics</span> in Washington, Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, announced plans for an all-electric airplane designated as X-57, part of the agency's efforts to make aviation more efficient and less of a polluter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The X-57 will take the first giant step in opening a new era of aviation,'' Mr. Bolden declared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steps taken by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> will not translate into all-electric cross-country jetliners. But the agency hopes the technology can be incorporated into smaller, general aviation and commuter aircraft some years from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X-57 will look more like a Cessna, unlike some of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s earlier sleek, futuristic X-planes. Its cruising speed might hit 175 miles per hour. Its wings, however, will be unique -- far skinnier than usual and embedded with 14 motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem with traditional aircraft design is you have to size the wings so that you have safe takeoff and landing speeds, and so the wing tends to end up bigger than you need for cruise flight,'' said Sean Clarke, co-principal investigator for the project at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the X-57, the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> researchers are designing narrower wings that are efficient during cruise flight, powered by two 60-kilowatt electric motors at the wingtips that spin five-foot-wide propellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For takeoff and landing, 12 smaller 9-kilowatt motors powering two-foot-wide propellers will kick in to blow extra air over the skinny wings to generate the necessary lift. In flight, the smaller propellers are folded away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> has already purchased the Italian-designed Tecnam P2006T twin-engine four-seat aircraft that it will transform into the X-57. In the first step, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> will replace the gasoline-powered motors with electric ones, aiming for takeoff in about a year. Swapping out the wing will take another one to two years, Mr. Clarke estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X-plane designations are handed out by the <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> for experimental, cutting edge aircraft starting with the X-1 that broke the sound barrier in 1947. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s last X-plane effort, more than a decade ago, was the X-43A, a pilotless black dart that accelerated to almost 7,000 m.p.h., which set the record for a jet-powered aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NASA</span> researchers have nicknamed the new plane ''Maxwell,'' after James Clerk Maxwell, a 19th-century Scottish physicist who came up with the basic equations underlying electromagnetism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X-57 is far from the first electric airplane, and a solar-powered electric airplane called Solar Impulse is currently making a series of flights that will take it around the world. But Solar Impulse cruises at 30 to 40 m.p.h., of which Mr. Clarke said, ''I don't think anyone would classify as high speed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 175 m.p.h., the X-57 would be as fast as the original P2006T and other similar general aviation planes. ''That's a speed that could enable much greater market share for a technology like this,'' Mr. Clarke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operational costs could be cut by as much as 40 percent, and electric motors are much quieter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design does not overcome the shortcomings of electric propulsion. Its 800 pounds of batteries will replace the rear two passenger seats, and the seat next to the pilot will be replaced with instrumentation, leaving space for only the pilot and no passengers. It can stay aloft for only about one hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clarke said the technology could be scaled upward for commuter or regional airliners, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is investigating using fuel cells rather than batteries to provide the electricity. But limits in the speed of propeller-driven aircraft means they are unlikely for cross-country airline flights. ''I think all-electric would be a stretch for jetliners,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has four other X-plane projects in the pipeline, part of a 10-year aviation research program proposed by the Obama administration in February. ''This will be <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s moonshot for aviation,'' Mr. Bolden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That includes a supersonic airplane that would not generate supersonic booms. ''Talking about going around the world in six hours or going from Dubai in New York in an hour,'' Mr. Bolden said. ''That's absolutely incredible.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST month astronomers from the Kepler spacecraft team announced the discovery of 1,284 new planets, all orbiting stars outside our solar system. The total number of such ''exoplanets'' confirmed via Kepler and other methods now stands at more than 3,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This represents a revolution in planetary knowledge. A decade or so ago the discovery of even a single new exoplanet was big news. Not anymore. Improvements in astronomical observation technology have moved us from retail to wholesale planet discovery. We now know, for example, that every star in the sky likely hosts at least one planet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But planets are only the beginning of the story. What everyone wants to know is whether any of these worlds has aliens living on it. Does our newfound knowledge of planets bring us any closer to answering that question?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little bit, actually, yes. In a paper published in the May issue of the journal Astrobiology, the astronomer Woodruff Sullivan and I show that while we do not know if any advanced extraterrestrial civilizations currently exist in our galaxy, we now have enough information to conclude that they almost certainly existed at some point in cosmic history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among scientists, the probability of the existence of an alien society with which we might make contact is discussed in terms of something called the Drake equation. In 1961, the National Academy of Sciences asked the astronomer Frank Drake to host a scientific meeting on the possibilities of ''interstellar communication.'' Since the odds of contact with alien life depended on how many advanced extraterrestrial civilizations existed in the galaxy, Drake identified seven factors on which that number would depend, and incorporated them into an equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first factor was the number of stars born each year. The second was the fraction of stars that had planets. After that came the number of planets per star that traveled in orbits in the right locations for life to form (assuming life requires liquid water). The next factor was the fraction of such planets where life actually got started. Then came factors for the fraction of life-bearing planets on which intelligence and advanced civilizations (meaning radio signal-emitting) evolved. The final factor was the average lifetime of a technological civilization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drake's equation was not like Einstein's E=mc^2. It was not a statement of a universal law. It was a mechanism for fostering organized discussion, a way of understanding what we needed to know to answer the question about alien civilizations. In 1961, only the first factor -- the number of stars born each year -- was understood. And that level of ignorance remained until very recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why discussions of extraterrestrial civilizations, no matter how learned, have historically boiled down to mere expressions of hope or pessimism. What, for example, is the fraction of planets that form life? Optimists might marshal sophisticated molecular biological models to argue for a large fraction. Pessimists then cite their own scientific data to argue for a fraction closer to 0. But with only one example of a life-bearing planet (ours), it's hard to know who is right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or consider the average lifetime of a civilization. Humans have been using radio technology for only about 100 years. How much longer will our civilization last? A thousand more years? A hundred thousand more? Ten million more? If the average lifetime for a civilization is short, the galaxy is likely to be unpopulated most of the time. Once again, however, with only one example to draw from, it's back to a battle between pessimists and optimists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But our new planetary knowledge has removed some of the uncertainty from this debate. Three of the seven terms in Drake's equation are now known. We know the number of stars born each year. We know that the percentage of stars hosting planets is about 100. And we also know that about 20 to 25 percent of those planets are in the right place for life to form. This puts us in a position, for the first time, to say something definitive about extraterrestrial civilizations -- if we ask the right question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our recent paper, Professor Sullivan and I did this by shifting the focus of Drake's equation. Instead of asking how many civilizations currently exist, we asked what the probability is that ours is the only technological civilization that has ever appeared. By asking this question, we could bypass the factor about the average lifetime of a civilization. This left us with only three unknown factors, which we combined into one ''biotechnical'' probability: the likelihood of the creation of life, intelligent life and technological capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might assume this probability is low, and thus the chances remain small that another technological civilization arose. But what our calculation revealed is that even if this probability is assumed to be extremely low, the odds that we are not the first technological civilization are actually high. Specifically, unless the probability for evolving a civilization on a habitable-zone planet is less than one in 10 billion trillion, then we are not the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To give some context for that figure: In previous discussions of the Drake equation, a probability for civilizations to form of one in 10 billion per planet was considered highly pessimistic. According to our finding, even if you grant that level of pessimism, a trillion civilizations still would have appeared over the course of cosmic history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, given what we now know about the number and orbital positions of the galaxy's planets, the degree of pessimism required to doubt the existence, at some point in time, of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization borders on the irrational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In science an important step forward can be finding a question that can be answered with the data at hand. Our paper did just this. As for the big question -- whether any other civilizations currently exist -- we may have to wait a long while for relevant data. But we should not underestimate how far we have come in a short time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Floating, and then learning to move around in zero gravity and essentially flying from place to place, is pretty amazing. I find that the longer I'm here, the more coordinated and natural it feels. The other aspect of our life here that is just incredible is looking out our windows and seeing Earth. The view is truly remarkable, and it is diverse in so many ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are your favorite natural phenomenon or places on Earth to fly over?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love the coral reefs around the planet -- the different shades of blue are very striking. And Africa and Australia in places look like an alien world. I love trying to capture the unique and strange features on these continents. Photographing cities at night is also one of my favorites.

I don't think that will happen soon, though. Getting to space takes a tremendous amount of energy, and once you arrive, there is a lot of overhead to living here. Your environment is completely based on the life support system onboard your vehicle, and you also have to send up everything you need to live. We will have to find a significantly cheaper way to leave the planet, and life support systems will need to be very robust.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing our planet from this perspective is pretty unbelievable. The Earth is beautiful, dynamic, unusual and diverse. When I'm taking photographs and we pass over countries where I know someone, I often think about them, and when we pass over historical sites or areas where there is some current event, it immediately brings them to mind. In this way, it makes the world seem smaller and more interconnected to me.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an imposing stance, the astronaut Gordon Cooper towers over visitors to the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at <span class="companylink">Vassar College</span>. Everything about him glows: his metallic spacesuit, the soles of his shoes, the helmet he clutches in the crook of his arm. His head is an otherworldly blue, his hair and eyes blaze white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper was one of the seven astronauts who participated in Project Mercury, America's first manned space program. His giant image, at the entrance to the museum's atrium gallery, is a site-specific mural created by Mungo Thomson, who manipulated the colors in a photograph from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s public archives. Part of the Los Angeles-based artist's continuing series ''Negative Space,'' the mural covers a 23-foot-high wall where, near the ceiling, a small circular window suggests a celestial orb in the distance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper is an apt ambassador for ''Touch the Sky,'' an exhibition of 51 works by 19 artists, each responding to the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe. The show presents an array of approaches, on a spectrum from factual to imaginary, in media including paint, pencil, printmaking, video, assorted photographic techniques and a bit of powdered cocaine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a deep human desire to know more about our surroundings,'' said Mary-Kay Lombino, the museum's curator of contemporary art and photography and the organizer of the exhibition. ''But human understanding has its limits. We can't really see the universe. We can't conceive of its vastness. We can't truly understand it. Still, we have this desire to do so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That desire is manifest throughout the galleries. It is there in a grouping of astrophotographs, shot through telescopes. The oldest, ''Moon in First Quarter,'' was taken by Lewis M. Rutherfurd, an amateur scientist in New York, who invented the device he used. It shows the moon's maria (lava plains) in remarkable detail, considering it was made in 1865.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technological leaps are evident in the images of much higher resolution produced by two contemporary artists. Four black-and-white photographs by David Malin, an Australian astrophotographer, include a similar view of the moon's maria as well as other dramatic -- and beautiful -- interstellar events. Michael Benson, an artist and writer in New York, stitched together raw digital data collected by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to create his composite version of Jupiter's moon Io. The dazzling gold sphere, pockmarked with craters, pops against a black background, red flames from two volcanic eruptions visible near the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Benson and Mr. Thomson, other ''Touch the Sky'' artists mined the expressive potential of appropriated imagery. The source materials for a suite of 10 lithographs made by Nancy Graves in 1972 were <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s color-coded geologic maps of Earth's moon. Using pointillist marks, Ms. Graves abstracted the maps into dotted expanses of color.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiki Smith's photogravure ''Europa'' underscores the correlation between female and celestial bodies. Twin found images of Jupiter's icy moon are printed in mottled tones on linen-hued Japanese paper. Crinkly and slightly raised, the moons' roundness conjures orbs, but it also conjures breasts, and the creaminess around them evokes lingerie or bare skin. Below, inscribed in red, are the words ''I am the flesh of the full moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to depict the magnitude of the universe, the Belgian artist Mishka Henner made ''Astronomical,'' a scale model of the solar system in the form of a 12-volume, 6,000-page artist book. With the sun on Page 1 and Pluto on Page 6,000, and the width of each page equivalent to a million kilometers in space, the work, completed in 2011, contains page after page of blackness. ''When you finally come to a planet, it's just a speck. In this context, it's almost possible to get your head around it,'' Ms. Lombino said, emphasizing the word ''almost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The serene multitude in Vija Celmins's etching ''Untitled Galaxy,'' from 1986, is an imagined realm where the stars are actually absences of black ink. ''Every star is a tiny area where you are seeing through to the paper,'' Ms. Lombino said. ''You can see the human hand in the markings on the plate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multilayered universe in Laura Battle's ''How Long Is Your Past, How Far Is Your Future'' is also invented. The 16-foot-long, site-specific painting is filled with cosmological symbols: a north star, a blood moon, a reference to the Fibonacci sequence, the suggestion of a black hole (albeit a colorful one). A subtle but overarching spiral pays homage to Vera Rubin, an astronomer (and a 1948 Vassar graduate) who studied spiral galaxies. In an email, Ms. Battle, who teaches painting and drawing at Bard College, attributed her fascination with astronomy to ''my interest in the profound connection between knowing and imagining, the basis for all artistic and scientific research.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Touch the Sky'' was organized as part of a yearlong, campuswide celebration of the sciences. Ms. Lombino dedicated the exhibition to Maria Mitchell, one of America's first professional female astronomers and the first professor hired at Vassar. All of the works challenge visitors to the museum to reconsider, and perhaps expand, their conceptions of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what Sharon Harper aimed to do when, in Clearmont, Wyo., in 2005, she brought her large-format camera outside nightly to photograph the sky. She chose different locations, shifted the orientation of her camera, altered her exposures from eight seconds up to 30 minutes and repeatedly re-exposed the same sheet of film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the resulting print, which is part of a body of work titled ''Moon Studies and Star Scratches,'' a cobalt blue sky is flecked with radiant orbs, fingernail moons and slender white lines tracing the paths of stars. In a second piece from the same series, gleaming spheres and crescent moons seem to be frolicking among smears of light. During a telephone interview, Ms. Harper, a professor of visual art at Harvard, described her process as a ''call and response'' and a ''partnership'' incorporating her movement, the astronomical movement, the camera's optics, the film's properties and, ultimately, the viewer's perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Photography is such an observational medium,'' she said. ''Usually it tracks things that are culturally referential, or that show veracity, or that are a window to reality as we see it. I'm trying to turn it inward and look at the process of perception.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the cocaine, Matthew Brandt, who lives and works in Los Angeles, sprinkled it onto photographer's velvet, the vivid white against the rich black mimicking a distant galaxy. The accompanying label quotes the artist as stating that the piece ''hints at altered perceptions, and making pictures of nebulas and stars is a way to talk about that.'' (The label also includes a legal disclaimer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mounted behind Plexiglas, the surface of the dark work, from a series called ''Night Skies,'' is reflective. Noting her image in its surface, Ms. Lombino said, ''We are able to look into it and see ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Touch the Sky'' through Aug. 21 at the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at <span class="companylink">Vassar College</span>, Poughkeepsie. ''Late Night at the Lehman Loeb: Observatory Night'' on June 23; gallery open until 9 p.m. fllac.vassar.edu or 845-437-5632.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomically speaking, Mars and Mercury dominated May. But now that it's June, Saturn has a chance to shine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our solar system's ''Lord of the Rings'' will be at opposition starting the early morning hours of Friday, meaning it will align with Earth and the sun. This arrangement will provide amateur astronomers with one of their best opportunities this year to see the butterscotch beauty with the naked eye.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be visible all night, rising at the exact point in the sky opposite where the sun sets. Saturn reaches opposition around 3 a.m. Eastern time, but the best time to look for it will be after midnight your local time when it is highest in the night sky. You'll be able to see the ringed planet glow throughout the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An easy way to spot Saturn is to let Mars be your guide. The red planet, which reached its own opposition earlier this week, will be a hard-to-miss bright crimson dot. Saturn is the golden orb to its left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a telescope, you can see the planet's cream-colored cloud bands, which are caused by ammonia crystals floating in its atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a bonus, the planet's famous disks will be tilted at a 26-degree angle, offering those with backyard telescopes a chance to see them. At this angle you'll catch a view of a dark gap that separates the rings in two parts called the ''Cassini Division.'' The gap was discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, the namesake of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting the planet since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After you ogle Saturn's regal rings, it's time to turn toward its moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you look at Saturn through a telescope, you can't help but see several of its four brightest moons -- Rhea, Tethys, Dione, Titan -- and maybe more,'' Linda Spilker, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in an email. ''If you just see one, that's Titan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titan is the largest Saturnian satellite, with a diameter that's about 50-percent larger than our own moon. ''Titan is so bright that even if you have a pair of binoculars and look out to Saturn you can see this bright point of light,'' said Dr. Spilker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you find Titan, keep its location in mind for next week because on June 7 it will be the sight of Cassini's next flyby.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Approaching the Unknown'' can't avoid comparisons with ''The Martian'' from last fall. Both movies feature a solo astronaut (Mark Strong here, Matt Damon in that Ridley Scott film) who fends off probable death with Rube Goldberg solutions. In this case, the problems begin long before Mars is reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the movie is often derivative -- there are also echoes of ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' both adaptations of ''Solaris,'' ''Moon,'' ''Interstellar'' and Epcot -- the tense scenario can withstand repetition, and seeing it executed on a lower budget, with modest effects, carries its own interest. (This is the feature directing debut of Mark Elijah Rosenberg, who founded the outdoor screening series Rooftop Films.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strong plays Capt. William D. Stanaforth, who believes he has seen enough of Earth. He is stubbornly, nihilistically private: Before his Mars mission, to perfect a device that produces water from dirt, he ventures into the desert alone. (You would think his success would solve this planet's water problems, but word doesn't seem to have gotten around.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanaforth's individualism at times puts him at odds with mission control (Luke Wilson plays his friend there) and colleagues (Sanaa Lathan, Anders Danielsen Lie, Charles Baker). If ''Approaching the Unknown'' isn't entirely satisfying, Mr. Strong reaches high with his portrayal of the unraveling of a man who believes survival is a matter of engineering.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the photos featured on these stamps came from New Horizons' predecessors, like the Messenger spacecraft for Mercury and Voyager 2 with Neptune. The images of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus came from the Hubble Space Telescope. Earth's ''Blue Marble'' was made using the weather satellite Suomi NPP, which orbits the planet 14 times a day.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- <span class="companylink">NASA</span> successfully inflated a new experimental room at the International Space Station on Saturday, producing the world's first pump-up compartment for astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation took much longer than expected, stretching over three days.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronaut Jeffrey Williams spent seven hours on Saturday opening and closing an air valve to expand the compartment. Enough air finally seeped inside so that the puffy white pod could stretch to its full size of 13 feet in length and 10.5 feet in diameter, which is equivalent to a small bedroom. Internal air tanks provided the final pressurization to complete the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams and his five crewmates will now have to wait a week before entering the pod. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> wants to make certain the chamber is airtight before opening the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s second attempt to inflate the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, named for the aerospace company that created it as a precursor to potential moon and Mars habitats, and orbiting tourist hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BEAM barely expanded during Thursday's inflation attempt. Experts believe the soft-sided compartment was tightly packed for so long before its launch last month that its fabric layers had trouble unfolding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure inside the chamber was relieved on Friday to ease the friction among the multiple layers. By Saturday, the cubicle had swelled an additional six feet in length, and looked more like a giant beach ball with every pulse of air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, Mr. Williams opened the valve 25 times on Saturday for a total of 2.5 minutes' worth of air flowing from the space station into the chamber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popping noises could be heard as pressure built inside the BEAM. Officials said it was the sound of internal straps releasing as the pod swelled in both length and girth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> insisted on a slow inflation to avoid a sudden pressurization of the BEAM that could stress the connecting parts of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> paid $17.8 million to <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> for this version of the BEAM, which could lead to a bigger inflatable room being constructed at the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's founder, Robert Bigelow, is developing a pair of private inflatable space stations that could fly in a few years. Mr. Bigelow, a longtime hotel entrepreneur, sees inflatables as the future of spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because expandable spacecraft can be compressed for launch, the saved space allows rockets to carry more cargo. The standard aluminum rooms that currently make up the space station cannot be larger than what fits into a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BEAM -- which sits empty except for sensors -- will remain attached to the orbiting lab for two years as engineers measure temperature, radiation levels and resistance to impact from space debris. Given its experimental status, the compartment will be off limits to astronauts most of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, formally known as <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., delivered the BEAM early last month, and the compartment was installed on the outside of the 250-mile-high outpost. Launch delays had kept it grounded an extra six months.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDNASA will try again on Saturday morning to inflate a new room for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first attempt on Thursday to pump air into the module known as the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam, the bulbous, balloon-like structure did not expand as much as expected. Beam is a test of technology to construct soft-sided space habitats with walls made of fabric instead of metal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fold-up, blowup approach would help solve the problem of how to build something spacious that can be packed into the narrow payload confines of a rocket. Beam was taken to the space station last month on a Falcon 9 rocket launched by the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. The module was then attached to one of the station's docking ports, and it remained folded up until Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first steps of closing valves, cutting straps and releasing bolts went without a hitch. But as the crew tried to inflate it, Beam moved out only five inches toward the fully expanded length of 73 inches. The diameter reached 103 inches, but fully expanded, Beam's diameter is meant to be 127 inches. The process was halted as engineers took a closer look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ran into higher forces than our model predicted,'' Jason Crusan, NASA's director of advanced exploration systems, said in a telephone news conference on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, the company that built Beam at a cost of $17.8 million, said there were no concerns about the module itself. Still, they said they wanted to take a slow, methodical approach to ensure that the module does not pop out suddenly, potentially shaking and twisting the rest of the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said the snag was most likely caused by friction between the layers of fabric. The launching of Beam was delayed after the loss of an earlier <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> cargo flight, and the additional months spent in the folded-up configuration may have added to the friction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overnight, Beam expanded a bit more, adding another inch in length and eight inches in diameter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, air was taken out of the module, to be pumped back in on Saturday. Coverage by NASA Television on the web will begin at 8:45 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it runs into another snag, deployment would likely be delayed to late next week, as astronauts on the space station tend to other tasks like deploying small satellites known as CubeSats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said that there was no rush to get Beam inflated, and that they were confident they would eventually succeed. ''We have plenty of time to work this,'' Mr. Crusan said. ''Beam doesn't expire. It's perfectly safe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once inflated, it will be tested for leaks. Astronauts will then install sensors inside the module to measure its performance during the next two years. After that, Beam is to be detached and disposed, burning up in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launched another Falcon 9 rocket, this time not for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> but to put the Thaicom 8 communications satellite in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> was able to successfully land the booster stage of the rocket on a floating platform in the Atlantic. That is the fourth time <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has recovered the booster, part of efforts to cut the cost of launches by reusing rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch was postponed from Thursday because of a glitch with the second-stage engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating,'' Elon Musk, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief executive, reported on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hundreds of thousands more have not yet been discovered, and whether any of those are on course to slam into our planet, no one knows. So finding and tracking all the asteroids that could cross Earth's path would allow officials to issue warnings and potentially provide time to deflect dangerous ones.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community of scientists contemplating such doomsday possibilities is small and usually cordial -- at least until Nathan P. Myhrvold barged in. Once the chief technologist at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, Dr. Myhrvold moved on to other endeavors like a six-volume, 2,438-page compendium of cooking knowledge that has been celebrated by chefs. (A sequel, about baking, is in the works.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also become a statistics scold of scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His latest target is <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, in a squabble over data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WISE, launched in 2009, snapped images of three-quarters of a billion stars, galaxies and other celestial objects, including the heat emissions of asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An offshoot called Neowise used the heat data to calculate the size and reflectivity of 158,000 asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold contends that the Neowise analysis is deeply flawed. ''The bad news is it's all basically wrong,'' he said. ''Unfortunately for a lot of it, it's never going to be as accurate as they had hoped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He submitted his own analysis of the Neowise results to the journal Icarus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold isn't arguing that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has overlooked dangers from the known asteroids. But he does question whether scientists know as much as they think they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also zeroed in on a proposed space-based telescope with a price tag of more than half a billion dollars, the Near-Earth Object Camera, or Neocam, a project headed by some of the same scientists whose work he is second-guessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the millions of asteroids are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some dip closer to the sun. There is no doubt that some will hit Earth someday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger the asteroid, the greater the potential cataclysm. The reflectivity of the surface -- what astronomers call albedo -- tells how easily it can be detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From the practical perspective of finding asteroids,'' Dr. Myhrvold said, ''it's really important that we know the distribution of diameters and the distribution of albedos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s scientists, the estimates of asteroid diameters made by Neowise are often within 10 percent of the actual size. But Dr. Myhrvold says the uncertainties are much greater, more than 100 percent in many cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space agency officials disagree. ''He's a very smart man,'' said Lindley Johnson, who oversees <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s efforts to protect the planet from space rocks. ''But that doesn't make him an expert in everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Johnson said <span class="companylink">NASA</span> experts had pointed out errors and that Dr. Myhrvold had not fixed them. ''It's overly simplistic, and he makes some assumptions that are not valid,'' Dr. Johnson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other scientists say that Dr. Myhrvold's criticisms have merit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do think he's performed a really very useful service,'' said Alan W. Harris, a senior research scientist at the Space Science Institute, ''to do the error analysis more carefully and alert people that you shouldn't just take some of the data out of the WISE table and just assume they're gospel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if Dr. Myhrvold is correct, Dr. Harris said the Neowise data ''has good enough validity to be useful for most purposes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not Even an Astronomer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold is not an astronomer. He had never done research on asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is often vilified as a ''patent troll,'' because <span class="companylink">Intellectual Ventures</span>, the company he founded after leaving <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> in 1999, acquires patents and extracts licensing fees from other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his paleontological endeavors -- another hobby -- he challenged research by a Florida State University professor, Gregory M. Erickson, about the growth rates of dinosaurs. In a 2013 paper, Dr. Myhrvold described the perceived statistical wrongs and stopped just short of accusing Dr. Erickson of manipulating the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections have been appended to several of Dr. Erickson's papers, including two in Nature. Dr. Erickson and his colleagues maintain that the mistakes did not alter their conclusions. Florida State cleared Dr. Erickson of wrongdoing after an inquiry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having somebody like Nathan having a different perspective and different background coming in and looking at it with fresh eyes, I think there's nothing wrong with that,'' said Kristina Curry Rogers, a vertebrate paleontologist at Macalester College in Minnesota who was an author on Dr. Erickson's Nature papers. ''It makes us all think.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold was drawn into asteroids research when the <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span>, a nonprofit organization that advocates planetary defense efforts, asked him to contribute money for Sentinel, a privately financed $450-million, asteroid-finding spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What they didn't know is that I had been interested in killer asteroids for a long time,'' Dr. Myhrvold said. After all, an asteroid slamming into Earth is believed to have brought the age of dinosaurs to an end 66 million years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Myhrvold learned of several other efforts, including <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Neocam, which would cost about $500 million (plus the rocket to launch it), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a ground-based observatory already under construction in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each group offered computer simulations of how many unseen asteroids would be spotted, making different assumptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published in March in The Publications of the <span class="companylink">Astronomical Society of the Pacific</span>, Dr. Myhrvold took a simpler approach to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. He looked at the volume of space that each telescope could observe, then calculated what fraction of unseen asteroids would pass through that space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought it all looked quite reasonable,'' said Steven R. Chesley, a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ''Nathan definitely brings a fresh approach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold concluded that the ground-based telescope in Chile, a $665 million collaboration of the <span class="companylink">United States Department of Energy</span>, the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span> and other organizations, could find up to 90 percent of near-Earth asteroids if it spent more time looking low in the sky, closer to the Earth's horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zeljko Ivezic, the telescope's project scientist, said the trade-off would be a two-year postponement in completing its survey of the rest of the cosmos and an additional cost of $100 million, and telescope officials have asked <span class="companylink">NASA</span> whether it would help pay for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Dr. Myhrvold, who became wealthy from his <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> days, decided not to donate money to B612.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also not given any money to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which has received some private financing from Bill Gates, his former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> boss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In writing the paper published in March, Dr. Myhrvold talked with people working on the different projects, including Amy Mainzer, the principal investigator for Neocam and Neowise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold said that Dr. Mainzer argued that a ground-based telescope could not detect asteroids within Earth's orbit because they would be too close to the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seemed strange to Dr. Myhrvold, because even amateurs can easily spot celestial objects far inside Earth's orbit like Venus, 26 million miles closer to the sun than Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold said Dr. Mainzer responded that large telescopes were not designed to point that close to the ground. But the one in Chile is, he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was happy he pointed out there was a misconception that LSST could not see within the Earth orbit,'' said Dr. Ivezic, a professor at the University of Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chesley of <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is coordinating a more detailed analysis of the telescope's asteroid-finding prowess, with preliminary findings expected in late summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent presentations, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials have portrayed Neocam more as a complement than a competitor. ''It's a team sport,'' Dr. Johnson said. ''There isn't any one system that is going to provide us all the data we need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> declined to make Dr. Mainzer available for an interview. Responding to written questions, she said the Neowise team stood behind the findings and that the results had been validated by independent observations and other researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Principle of Hibachi Grills</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It struck Dr. Myhrvold that the albedo calculations of the Neocam team violated a basic tenet of physics known as Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which says shinier objects radiate less heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple demonstration of that, Dr. Myhrvold said, is the shiny chrome cooking surface of a restaurant hibachi grill. A dark grill surface would bathe diners in uncomfortable waves of heat. The Neocam models failed to take into account the effects of reflected sunlight, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then took a closer look at Neowise, too. One aspect Dr. Myhrvold found curious was that in more than 100 instances, the Neowise team reported asteroid diameters that matched exactly what had previously been determined by other methods like radar measurements and spacecraft flybys. ''I think it's a pretty strong smoking gun that something is wrong,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For her part, Dr. Mainzer said the asteroids with exact measurement matches were used for calibration and thus the values were set to those that had been previously observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid community, while small, includes two unrelated scientists named Alan William Harris. The Dr. Harris at the <span class="companylink">Space Science Institute</span>, who is 71, is known as ''Al the Elder,'' while ''Al the Younger,'' 64, is a German Aerospace Center scientist who developed the computer model used by the Neowise scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The younger Dr. Harris agrees that Dr. Myhrvold has raised a valid point about Kirchhoff's Law and that a closer look at the Neowise analysis would be fruitful. Earlier satellites looked at longer wavelengths where reflected sunlight was less of a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he disapproves of Dr. Myhrvold's scolding tone. ''There's very much a schoolteacher attitude about it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Myhrvold insists he has no vendetta against the Neowise scientists. But, he added, ''I don't think it's unduly mean of me to point out their data is irreproducible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirchhoff's law could again come into play with Neocam, which would make observations at fairly short infrared wavelengths. Neocam is one of five lower-cost missions under consideration, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is to approve one or two of them in September, aiming for launch in the 2020s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mainzer deferred answering some follow-up questions, saying those issues would be best addressed by the referees reviewing Dr. Myhrvold's paper. ''We believe at this point it's best to allow the process of peer review -- the foundation of the scientific process -- to move forward,'' she wrote.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers operating <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s planet-finding spacecraft announced Tuesday that they had validated the planethood of 1,284 new candidates from Kepler's voluminous catalog of potential exoplanets, the largest collection of new planets announced at one time. It brings the total of actual planets Kepler has discovered to more than 2,000.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of them orbit stars in a patch of sky on the Cygnus-Lyra border, where Kepler, launched in 2009, spent four years staring at 150,000 stars looking for the characteristic dimming when planets crossed their faces, until its pointing system broke down and the team had to develop a new observing strategy. Since then, Kepler has identified some 4,700 possible planets, and more keep being found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, it took lengthy and arduous ground-based telescopic observations to winnow impostors like double stars and other pretenders from the planet list. But the numbers have grown too large, the cosmos too verdant, for this case-by-case analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new results rely on a statistical technique developed by Timothy Morton, an astronomer at Princeton University, to vet the potential candidates in bulk, by analyzing the shape of the dips they make in starlight and taking into account how common the various types of impostors are and assigning a reliability score to each one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Planet candidates can be thought of like bread crumbs,'' said Dr. Morton in a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> teleconference on Tuesday. ''If you drop a few large crumbs on the floor, you can pick them up one by one. But if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, you're going to need a broom. This statistical analysis is our broom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, two dozen of the planets found and confirmed by Kepler occupy the so-called Goldilocks zones of their stars where liquid water and perhaps ''Life as We Think We Know It'' could exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extrapolating these results to the entire galaxy, Natalie Batalha, Kepler mission scientist from the Ames Research Center, said there could be 10 billion roughly Earth-size planets in the galaxy within their stars' habitable zones. The nearest habitable planet, she estimated, could be as close as 11 light-years. In the cosmic scheme of things, that is next door and reachable in our lifetimes with current or near-future technology. Last month, scientists announced a plan to try to send smartphone-like spacecraft to Alpha Centauri, which is 4.4 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was conceived as a mission to determine how common Earth-size planets, possible habitable rocks, are in the universe. The Kepler team, Dr. Batalha said, is now approaching in the next year or two the closeout of that mission, one that has helped change humanity's view of how friendly the cosmos might be to life, and has made exoplanets one of the most explosive fields in astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That quest will go on. Kepler will be passing the baton to future missions like <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s TESS, which will search for planets around nearby bright stars, starting in 2017.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's space agencies are calling for a new generation of satellites that would be precise enough to map greenhouse gas emissions from individual nations. Their goal is to replace decades of rough estimates with advanced monitoring of what has become one of the world's foremost concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, based on a growing body of research in space sensors, is delicate politically because the global system could verify or cast doubt on emission reports from the 196 member states of the <span class="companylink">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</span>, which was adopted in 1992. If built, the system could serve as an independent way to measure greenhouse gases and encourage lax countries to better comply with abatement goals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent Paris accord, which calls for the ''verification and certification of emission reductions,'' essentially gave the plan a diplomatic stamp of approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed system of satellites, six to eight in all, would be in orbit by 2030 to map clouds of carbon dioxide, the invisible gas linked to climate change. Rough estimates put the system's cost around $5 billion. It would resemble the global fleet of weather satellites that observe water clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials call the undertaking crucial for better dealing with aspects of climate change linked to civilization's waste gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's what we have to do if planet Earth is to be saved,'' said Jean-Yves Le Gall, the head of France's space agency and a leader of the initiative. ''It's a consciousness shared by the heads of all the space agencies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's well known that carbon dioxide emissions from natural sources and fossil-fuel combustion merge slowly into a global average long reported to be rising. But the exact contributions of individual countries are something of a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each nation draws on a mix of surface readings, economic analyses and ecological estimates to quantify their emissions. Experts say the self-reporting varies enormously in thoroughness, frequency and accuracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1992 climate accord calls on industrial states to issue reports annually, typically with much documentation. But developing countries, which comprise the vast majority of the pact's signatories, are required to make only sporadic communications. For instance, the world's biggest emitter, China, issued reports in 2004 and 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sense of urgency behind the satellite plan arises in part because developing countries a decade ago surpassed industrial nations as global emitters of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel combustion. Their estimated share stands at 60 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate experts say the rising percentage of sketchy information makes the overall portrait of global emitters increasingly blurry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The uncertainty,'' an October study by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> said, ''has increased up to the point where it could undermine the credibility and the stability of future climate agreements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting last fall, space agency leaders from China, India and other developing countries and industrial powers, including the United States, seized on such analyses to begin arguing for the satellite fleet. Last month, at a meeting in New Delhi, they issued a draft public declaration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''An international independent way of estimating emission changes,'' it said, ''would create a level playing field.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, France's space agency, known as CNES, for <span class="companylink">Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales</span>, based in Paris, said it had sent a penultimate draft for approval to the world's space agencies, 67 in all. The French agency added that it expects a final declaration by Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fleet proposal grows out of strides in the development of carbon-dioxide sensors for use in space. In 2002, the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> launched an environmental satellite, and in 2014 <span class="companylink">NASA</span> sent up the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, a satellite that takes readings of the earth's atmosphere nearly a million times a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, Japan and France plan to launch three more research satellites from now to 2020. Europe and the United States are considering two more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say that making sufficient progress in the tricky research to warrant the establishment of an operational fleet will pose a major challenge, especially in learning how to distinguish human emissions from natural fluxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is hard science,'' said Stephen W. Pacala, a Princeton University scientist who was the chairman of a National Research Council study on verifying greenhouse gas emissions. ''The aspiration is marvelous. But the devil here is very much in the scientific details.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fleet, for instance, would have to differentiate new human releases not only from the globe's existing blanket of carbon dioxide but from such natural sources as volcanoes, forest fires and decomposing plants and animals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael H. Freilich, the director of NASA's Earth Science Division, said the goal was nonetheless easier in some respects than monitoring the weather from orbiting spacecraft. Clouds and storms are tracked on scales of minutes to hours, he said, whereas the necessary time frame for scrutinizing carbon-dioxide plumes ranges from days to weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble, he added, is that ''each measurement you make is going to be harder.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Freilich said that he had no doubt that the world's scientists in coming years would learn how to turn ''measurements into information'' that could help determine if nations are meeting their reduction goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would such a capability spark global resentment? Could it stir fears of an orbital police force?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is exactly what we want to avoid,'' Dr. Le Gall of the French space agency said last week in an interview. ''It's a risk. But it's why we want to have all the space agencies involved'' and agreeing on the best way forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, when the National Research Council released ''Verifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Methods to Support International Climate Agreements,'' Dr. Pacala took the opportunity to stress how a new era of precise measurement could have positive implications for diplomacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An objective system, he noted, ''would give nations confidence that their neighbors are living up to their commitments.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Directed by Toni Myers and made in cooperation with <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, most of ''A Beautiful Planet'' was shot by astronauts while on monthslong space missions.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before that happens, Mr. Musk, not to mention any would-be colonists, have to make sure that the technology for getting to Mars in one piece actually works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an announcement on Wednesday, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said it planned to send an unmanned Dragon capsule to Mars in 2018 and land it on the surface about six months later. (Mars and Earth line up only once every 26 months.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> also plans to send people to Mars, although not as quickly, aiming for the mid-2030s. On Wednesday afternoon, a couple of hours after the SpaceX Twitter message, Dava J. Newman, NASA's deputy administrator, wrote: ''We are closer than ever before to sending American astronauts to Mars than anyone, anywhere, at any time has ever been. A new consensus is emerging around <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s plan and timetable for sending astronauts to the Red Planet in the 2030s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> has emphasized that -- unlike the Apollo missions to the moon -- it is not working alone, but is enlisting the help of other countries and endeavors. Almost in passing, Dr. Newman mentioned the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> Mars effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Among the many exciting things we're doing with American businesses, we're particularly excited about an upcoming <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> project that would build upon a current 'no exchange of funds' agreement we have with the company,'' she wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In exchange for Martian entry, descent and landing data from <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>,'' she continued, ''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> will offer technical support for the firm's plan to attempt to land an uncrewed Dragon 2 spacecraft on Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landing on Mars is tricky. The atmosphere is thick enough that the energy of the arriving spacecraft slamming into the air molecules heats its outside to thousands of degrees, but it is too thin for parachutes to provide a gentle landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> has turned to innovative devices like airbags, used to cushion the landings of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004, and a Rube Goldberg-esque ''sky crane'' system to set down the larger and heavier Curiosity rover in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Ames Research Center in California proposed <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Dragon capsule as a cheaper way to land on Mars, using rocket engines. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> liked the idea enough to start working on it as well, signing an agreement to tap into <span class="companylink">NASA</span> expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dragon capsule would be launched on <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s larger Falcon Heavy rocket, which has yet to have its first flight. ''These missions will help demonstrate the technologies needed to land large payloads propulsively on Mars,'' said Philip Larson, a SpaceX spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s recent technological tours de force, getting to Mars in 2018 would be a huge, quick leap for a company that has yet to leave Earth's neighborhood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers announced on Tuesday that they have spotted a small moon around Makemake, one of the icy worlds beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This distant region of the solar system, known as the Kuiper belt, has been one of intriguing mysteries. When the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> demoted Pluto in 2006, it created a new category of celestial classification: dwarf planets, which are big enough to be round, but not big enough to be the gravitational bullies of their orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Pluto, three other Kuiper belt objects have been recognized as dwarf planets: Haumea, Makemake, Eris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto has five moons. Haumea has two moons. Eris has one moon. It had seemed that Makemake, (pronounced MAH-kay MAH-kay), 890 miles wide and the largest Kuiper belt object after Pluto and Eris, had none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Makemake was the odd one out,'' said Alex Parker, a research scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. ''Makemake was the only one that didn't have a moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology who led the team that discovered Haumea, Makemake and Eris, and the moons of Haumea and Eris, had looked for moons around Makemake, too. He did not find any, but that was not necessarily the end of the story. ''I've always been suspicious in the back of my mind,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers led by Marc W. Buie of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> decided to use the Hubble Space Telescope to take a closer look and see what might have been missed. They found a dot next to Makemake -- the moon, which, for now, is designated S/2015 (136472) 1 and nicknamed MK 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the moon turned up in the data, it was not actually that faint,'' said Dr. Parker, who performed the image analysis. (For the astronomers, 1/1,300th the brightness of Makemake is considered not that faint.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon's orbit is almost edge-on when seen from Earth. In the earlier observations, the moon was, by chance, too close to Makemake and obscured in the glare, Dr. Parker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers estimate that MK 2 was about 13,000 miles from Makemake and orbits about once every 12 days. More observations will enable them to precisely trace the orbit, and that will give an accurate measure of the mass and density of Makemake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery should also help resolve one of Makemake's mysteries: Temperature data has indicated that most of the surface is bright and cold, but some of it is dark and comparatively warm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the brightness of Makemake does not change as would be expected if the dark spots were rotating in and out of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the dark, warm signal emanates not from Makemake's surface, but from a moon covered with a charcoal-dark material circling Makemake. A dark, warm moon about 100 miles wide would largely agree with the observations, Dr. Parker said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than 50 women having flown in space over the last 50 years and the ranks of women astronauts growing, one might assume that a basic physiological question has been answered: What's the best approach to manage menstrual cycles in space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis published Thursday in the journal ''npj Microgravity'' reports that many women astronauts might choose to pause their periods while in space, especially as missions get longer, and discusses ways to do that. Using long-acting contraceptive methods, like implants or intrauterine devices, may be best, the authors say -- not only for the women but for reasons of convenience and cargo.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors, Dr. Varsha Jain at King's College London, who has been described as a space gynecologist, and Virginia E. Wotring at <span class="companylink">Baylor College of Medicine</span>, who might be considered a space pharmacologist, write that menstruating in space is safe. (The old myth that zero gravity would cause ''retrograde'' menstrual flow, causing blood to accumulate in the abdomen and cause infections, has been shown to be baseless.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> oral history, Dr. Rhea Seddon, an astronaut who flew on three space shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s, said, ''I'm not totally sure who had the first period in space, but they came back and said, 'Period in space, just like period on the ground. Don't worry about it.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sally Ride, who in 1983 became the first American woman in space, said in another oral history that engineers were ''trying to decide how many tampons should fly on a one-week flight; they asked, 'Is 100 the right number?''' She replied: ''No. That would not be the right number.'' When the engineers told her, ''Well, we want to be safe,'' she said she answered: ''Well, you can cut that in half with no problem at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But having a period in space can be a logistical challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The waste disposal systems onboard the U.S. side of the International Space Station that reclaim water from urine were not designed to handle menstrual blood, thus idealizing the minimization of breakthrough bleeding during menstrual suppression,'' write the authors, whose review included discussions with the astronauts Dr. Ellen Baker and Serena Aunon, among others. Also, ''the practicalities of personal hygiene while menstruating during spaceflight could be challenging, e.g., limited wash water supply or the task of changing hygiene products in microgravity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors write that birth control pills that ''terrestrially'' are taken for 21 days followed by seven days of placebo, have long been adapted by women in space, who skip the placebo week and take the real pills continuously in order to halt menstruation. But as spaceflights get longer, there are things to consider, including that taking a pill every day on, say, a three-year mission, would require about 1,100 pills, the authors wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Drug stability has not been tested for hormonal medications over such a long time in space or with the impact of deep-space radiation,'' the analysis says. Plus, think of all the blister packs. They increase ''upmass,'' the weight of stuff carted along from Earth, and they add to waste disposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors also suggest areas for further investigation with long--term birth control. With injections, which last three months, some studies have found a reduction in bone mineral density, and it is unclear how space travel would affect that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers examined hormonal I.U.D.s, which are currently licensed for five years, and implants, which last up to three years. Both, they wrote, look like a pretty good bet, they write, but they flag one potential issue with implants:r Might the tiny match stick inserted under the skin of the upper arm ''rub or catch on specialist equipment or attire such as the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory diving suit or the extra-vehicular activity suit?'' Terrestrial women don't typically have such wardrobe issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also the authors include this fun fact: Because women these days start menstruating sooner, give birth later, have fewer pregnancies and live longer, ''Modern women living in an industrialized country have more menstrual cycles compared with women of prehistoric times.'' How many more? Nearly three times as many: ''There are an estimated 450 ovulations per lifetime now, compared with 160 ovulations'' for prehistoric women. That's a lot more periods, period.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an attempt to leapfrog the planets and vault into the interstellar age, a bevy of scientists and other luminaries from Silicon Valley and beyond, led by Yuri Milner, a Russian philanthropist and Internet entrepreneur, announced a plan on Tuesday to send a fleet of robot spacecraft no bigger than iPhones to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system, 4.37 light-years away.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it all worked out -- a cosmically big ''if'' that would occur decades and perhaps $10 billion from now -- a rocket would deliver a ''mother ship'' carrying a thousand or so small probes to space. Once in orbit, the probes would unfold thin sails and then, propelled by powerful laser beams from Earth, set off one by one like a flock of migrating butterflies across the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within two minutes, the probes would be more than 600,000 miles from home -- as far as the lasers could maintain a tight beam -- and moving at a fifth of the speed of light. But it would still take 20 years for them to get to Alpha Centauri. Those that survived would zip past the star system, making measurements and beaming pictures back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of this plan is probably half a lifetime away. Mr. Milner and his colleagues estimate that it could take 20 years to get the mission off the ground and into the heavens, 20 years to get to Alpha Centauri and another four years for the word from outer space to come home. And there is still the matter of attracting billions of dollars to pay for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you and I will be happy to see the launch,'' Mr. Milner, 54, said in an interview, adding that progress in medicine and longevity would determine whether he would live to see the results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We came to the conclusion it can be done: interstellar travel,'' Mr. Milner said. He announced the project, called Breakthrough Starshot, in a news conference in New York on Tuesday, 55 years after Yuri Gagarin -- for whom Mr. Milner is named -- became the first human in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The English cosmologist and author Stephen Hawking is one of three members of the board of directors for the mission, along with Mr. Milner and Mark Zuckerberg, the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What makes human beings unique?'' Dr. Hawking asked. He went on to say, ''I believe that what makes us unique is transcending our limits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hawking added, ''Today we commit to the next great leap in the cosmos, because we are human and our nature is to fly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project will be directed by Pete Worden, a former director of NASA's Ames Research Center. He has a prominent cast of advisers, including the Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb as chairman; the British astronomer royal Martin Rees; the Nobel Prize-winning astronomer Saul Perlmutter, of the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>; Ann Druyan, an executive producer of the television mini-series ''Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'' and the widow of Carl Sagan; and the mathematician and author Freeman Dyson, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are about 20 key challenges we are asking the world's scientific experts to help us with -- and we are willing to financially support their work,'' Dr. Worden said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A detailed technical description of the project appears on the project's website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimating that the project could cost $5 billion to $10 billion, Mr. Milner is initially investing $100 million for research and development. He said he was hoping to lure other investors, especially from international sources. Both <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> have been briefed on the project, Dr. Worden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of that money would go toward a giant laser array, which could be used to repeatedly send probes toward any star (as long as the senders were not looking for return mail anytime soon) or around the solar system, perhaps to fly through the ice plumes of Saturn's moon Enceladus, which might contain microbes -- tiny forms of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense, the start of this space project reflects the make-it-or-break-it mode of Silicon Valley. Rather than send one big, expensive spacecraft on a journey of years, send thousands of cheap ones. If some break or collide with space junk, others can take their place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interstellar travel is a daunting and humbling notion, but Alpha Centauri is an alluring target for such a trip: It is the closest star system to our own, and there might be planets in the system. The system, which looks to the naked eye like one star, consists of three: Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, which circle each other, and Proxima Centauri, which may be circling the other two. In recent years, astronomers have amassed data suggesting the possibility of an Earth-size planet orbiting Alpha Centauri B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take Voyager 1, humanity's most distant space probe, more than 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri if it were headed in that direction, which it is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, a variety of propulsion plans have been hatched to cross the void more quickly. In 1962, shortly after lasers were invented, Robert Forward, a physicist and science fiction author, suggested they could be used to push sails in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, Darpa, the <span class="companylink">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</span>, got into the act with 100 Year Starship, a contest to develop a business plan for interstellar travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts, Mr. Milner was initially skeptical of an interstellar probe. But three trends seemingly unrelated to space travel -- advances in nanotechnology and lasers and the relentless march of Moore's Law, making circuits ever smaller and more powerful -- have converged in what he called ''a surprising way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now possible to fit the entire probe with computers, cameras and electrical power, a package with a mass of only one gram, a thirtieth of an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, Dr. Loeb said, is about what the guts of an iPhone, stripped of its packaging and displays, amount to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power would come from a tiny radioactive source like americium, the element in smoke detectors. Propulsion would come from foil sails that would unfold to catch laser light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laser is the most intimidating and expensive of the challenges. It would have to generate 100 gigawatts of power for the two minutes needed to accelerate the butterfly probes to a fifth of the speed of light (subjecting its tiny innards to 60,000 times the force of normal gravity, by the way). That is about as much energy as it takes for a space shuttle to lift off, Dr. Loeb said, and about 100 times the output of a typical nuclear power plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To achieve that energy would require an array about a mile across combining thousands of lasers firing in perfect unison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, to keep the beam tightly focused on one probe at a time would require an adaptive optics system that compensated for atmospheric turbulence -- something astronomers know how to do over a span of 10 meters, the size of a big telescope mirror now, but not over a mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Posing another challenge is the design of the sails, which would have to be very thin and able to reflect the laser light without absorbing any of its energy. Absorbing as little as one part in 100,000 of the laser energy would vaporize the sail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another challenge might simply be to the imagination. Nobody knows what the Starshot fleet might find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Looking is very different from going and visiting,'' Dr. Loeb said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he noted, referring to recent physics experiments, ''Nature teaches us that its imagination is better than ours.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually: If you were in the middle of an asteroid belt, you probably wouldn't see any asteroids at all.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A popular game in the early days of video games was <span class="companylink">Atari</span>'s Asteroids. You would maneuver and spin a small triangular spaceship, blasting space rocks to bits until inevitably one of the asteroids smashes you into line segments. (Magically, the asteroids passed through each other unscathed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, it seemed, one had to continually dodge destruction. That was true in the ''Green Lantern'' movie in 2011 and perhaps most memorably in ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive conked out and Imperial TIE fighters and star cruisers close in pursuit, Han Solo steers his spacecraft into a thicket of asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're not actually going into an asteroid field?'' Princess Leia asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?'' Han Solo replies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C3PO, the fussbudget android, helpfully informs Han, ''Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.'' (Statistics pedants point out that C3PO should have said, ''approximately one in 3,720.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Never tell me the odds,'' Han says as the Millennium Falcon swerves past giant rocks left and right, top and bottom. One of the TIE fighters goes kaboom, then another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that asteroid field was in a galaxy far, far away, but it was still silly. Asteroids -- small, rocky chunks that never coalesced into a planet -- would not be that close to one another for a simple reason: If they were big enough and close enough to pose a danger to a spaceship, they would also be banging into each other, themselves reduced to tiny pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bad science inspired J.L. Galache, an astronomer at the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Mass., to figure out just how likely a spacecraft would get hit by an asteroid. In our solar system, most asteroids, perhaps a billion of them 100 meters or wider, can be found in a circular belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He calculated for those billion asteroids that are bigger than a football field, there would be just one asteroid per 33 quadrillion cubic miles. That means that in a cube 320,000 miles on a side -- that's a volume equal to some 120,000 Earths -- there would be, on average, just one asteroid inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> takes advantage of this fortunate circumstance every times it sends a spacecraft to the outer solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During nine missions -- most recently <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Juno mission on its way to Jupiter, nothing of significance has ever collided with a spacecraft. Of course, there is never a person seated in that spacecraft; the people looking for problems are back on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto wrote that when his spacecraft passed through the asteroid belt in 2006, the chance of collision was ''almost vanishingly small -- far less than one in one billion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, one could snooze while flying through the asteroid belt. But that would make for dull movies and easy video games.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest haul of freight aboard one of the company's Falcon 9 rockets includes an inflatable module that is to be added to the International Space Station, a test of technology that could provide ample living space for astronauts on future deep-space journeys.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really important to have a very regular supply chain,'' Kirk A. Shireman, NASA's manager for the space station program, said during a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasts call for a 90 percent chance of favorable weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s last cargo delivery in June last year ended in failure, with the rocket disintegrating 2 minutes, 19 seconds after launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investigation found that a strut holding a bottle of helium in the second stage snapped, starting a chain reaction that destroyed the rocket within a second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, founded by Elon Musk, a tech entrepreneur, revamped the design of the strut and its manufacturing process; it now individually tests every strut to ensure that each meets strength requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> resumed launching in December with a Falcon 9 carrying a commercial payload of 11 small communications satellites to orbit. That launch also was the first time <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> successfully recovered the booster stage of the Falcon 9 in one piece, landing it back at Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Friday's launch, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will again try to land the booster, on a floating platform instead of on land. So far, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is 0-for-4 in landing attempts at sea. Each time, the booster has reached the platform, but then toppled over and exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I certainly hope we will nail the landing this time,'' said Hans Koenigsmann, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s vice president for flight reliability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If launched on Friday, the Dragon capsule on top of the Falcon 9 rocket will arrive at the space station on Sunday. Plans are for it to stay at the space station until May, and then return to Earth carrying experimental samples including blood samples of Scott Kelly, the NASA astronaut who returned to Earth last month after nearly a year in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the nearly 7,000 pounds of supplies, equipment and experiments packed in the Dragon are seeds that will be grown on the space station. Last year for the first time, station astronauts ate red romaine grown and harvested in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, Chinese cabbage, chosen as the best growing and best tasting among tested vegetables, was added to the mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gioia D. Massa, the principal investigator of the experiment, said the research ''gives us a lot more information on how we can grow crops to provide supplemental nutrition to the astronauts as we start to do regular salad crop lettuce production on space station.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other experiments include an effort to track and catalog the variety of microbes living on the space station and a study of fungi in hopes that the weightless environment could spur them to produce novel compounds potentially useful as medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payload also includes 25 students' experiments that were lost on the earlier <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest piece will be the $17.8 million Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam. Unlike the other metal modules of the International Space Station, Beam has soft sides made of layers of materials including tough fabrics similar to those found in bulletproof vests. The soft sides allow the module to be packed into a tuna can-shape enclosure at the bottom of the Dragon capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks from now -- exactly when has not yet been scheduled -- the space station's robotic arm is to pluck the 3,100-pound module and attach it to a port on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fans will blow air from the rest of the station into Beam, pushing the walls outward to its final configuration, a cookie jar-like shape 12 feet long and 10.5 feet in diameter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During at least two years attached to the space station, sensors inside will take measurements like temperature, radiation, leakage of air, to gauge how well such structures perform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> of North Las Vegas, Nev., has been pursuing an ambitious project developing expandable modules after licensing technology that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had developed in the 1990s then abandoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Crusan, director for advanced exploration systems at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, said the space agency has long been intrigued by expandable modules, especially for habitats on the surface on Mars, but the uncertainties of the technology made them less appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Beam design incorporates much higher levels of safety than other parts of the space station, but the data could enable simpler, more cost effective designs in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigelow has also developed the B330, a much bigger module, with 20 times the volume of the Beam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company intends to create private space stations that it could lease to companies, other countries or even <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, but has slowed its work because there is currently no transportation other than Russian Soyuz rockets to take people to and from orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> is financing two companies, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, to develop spacecraft to take astronauts to the space stations with the first flights as soon as 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that occurs, Robert T. Bigelow, the founder and president, said he hoped to hook up two B330s together in orbit into a space station in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in the early phase of a new kind of spacecraft that offers a lot of promise,'' Mr. Bigelow said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlton Hall pointed to the puzzling object and explained that it was once a tie-down block for securing structures like antenna towers. Dr. Hall, the chief scientist for the space center's ecological program, said that when he started working here a few decades ago, the block had been buried. Now the sand that enveloped it is gone, swept away by the forces of coastal erosion and storms.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He gestured toward the waves rolling in nearby and said, ''The beach used to be at least 50 yards out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the dunes, a quarter mile away, sit two artificial hills some 50 feet high. Those are <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s two biggest launchpads. And to the south sit several smaller ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is America's busiest spaceport, and the water is coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like so much of Florida, the Space Coast -- a 72-mile stretch along the Atlantic -- is feeling the threat of climate change. Some of the erosion is caused by the churning energy of ocean currents along the coastline. Hurricane Sandy, whose power was almost certainly strengthened by climate change, took a big bite in 2012, flattening an already damaged dune line that provided protection from the Atlantic's battering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rising sea level will bring even greater risk over time -- and perhaps sooner than most researchers expected. According to a study published last week, warming pressure on the Antarctic ice sheet could help push sea levels higher by as much as five or six feet by the end of this century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> isn't just a victim of climate change. It contributes to climate science in many ways, and not only in the data from the many satellites that orbit the planet after leaving Earth from here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its astronauts also help build awareness of the growing urgency of climate change. Astronaut Scott Kelly, who recently returned from nearly a year in space, took hundreds of photographs that could seem like abstract art or a dire warning; in an email interview just before his descent, he said that he had seen changes in the planet even since his previous mission in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems to me there is more pollution in India and China than what I saw last time,'' he said. ''Definitely noticed the fires this summer in the U.S.A.; sometimes, could see the smoke all the way to Chicago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Weather systems where they are not supposed to be obvious,'' he added. ''The fragility of the atmosphere always apparent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pondering the Problem</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>, which has at least $32 billion worth of structures and facilities around the country, has been considering the possible effects of climate change for nearly a decade, said Kim W. Toufectis, a strategist who leads the master planning program for the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>, after all, is in the business of risk management. By 2007, ''we had to acknowledge that we should recognize climate change and extreme weather as a formal risk that we should be actually managing,'' Mr. Toufectis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all of its expertise and its ability to make forecasts based on data, Mr. Toufectis added, ''shame on us if we are not capitalizing on that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s climate risk extends far beyond Florida. About two-thirds of the land that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> manages is within 16 feet of mean sea level, and much of it is near the coasts. ''We are tremendously linked to the drink,'' Mr. Toufectis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnson Space Center in Texas sits by Clear Lake, an inlet of Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The surge from Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused power failures and debris pileup that shut down the center for a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Michoud Assembly Plant, which built the enormous orange tanks used by the space shuttle, sits at the eastern end of New Orleans, and narrowly missed being inundated in Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Ames Research Center is near San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's Climate Adaptation Science Investigators working group, which evaluates risks for all federal agencies, has predicted that sea level rise of five inches to more than two feet by 2050 could cause widespread problems for the five coastal <span class="companylink">NASA</span> sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal floods that might now occur once every 10 years could happen twice as often at Johnson, twice to three times as often at Kennedy and 10 times more often at Ames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> coastal centers that are already at risk of flooding are virtually certain to become more vulnerable in the future,'' the working group wrote in a 2014 report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency brought together the managers for each center to learn directly from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists about climate change risks. They took field trips to the vulnerable areas in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It became very real,'' said Cynthia E. Rosenzweig, senior research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, and an author of the 2014 report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Kennedy Space Center, of course, the elements are always a challenge. The air off the sea attacks delicate equipment and rusts structures. Hurricanes occasionally come through, as well. In 2004, Hurricane Frances tore hundreds of siding panels off the gargantuan Vehicle Assembly Building, requiring extensive repairs. Storms in 2007 and 2008 battered the shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in 2012, Hurricane Sandy sent a surge that hit the coast like a scouring pad, leveling about a mile of dune protection and leaving the landscape stretching toward the launchpads covered with sand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has spent much of a $3 million appropriation to rebuild a long dune to replace protective sands that have been washed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> sits in the middle of a vast wildlife refuge, so replacing the dunes was a more delicate job than simply sending in bulldozers and piling up dirt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those doing the work had to be considerate of the wildlife, like the endangered gopher tortoise, with its high-domed shell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sand that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> brought in had to resemble the sand that had been washed away, so the tortoises would be comfortable rebuilding burrows and sea turtles would be able to return to the site to nest. Workers took cuttings of plants from the old dunes, grew them and put in 180,000 individual plants to secure the new dunes. Now they are growing thick with grasses, sea oats, purple-flowered railroad vine and palmetto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Storms to Come</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one doubts, however, that more storms will come, and the warmer air and water brought by climate change are likely to lead to more destructive storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As climate change threatens, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has options that include hardening facilities against the rising seas with barriers and structures adapted to storms and flooding, or if adaptation is not possible, to strategically retreat. Any such strategies will be expensive -- though how expensive at this early stage is anyone's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retreat, however, is hardly an option any time soon for an agency that would need billions of dollars for new buildings and equipment alone -- not to mention the need to relocate staff with extensive expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is certain: Pads will still be needed. Kennedy Space Center will be the home to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s next-generation human spaceflight vehicles, and its pads are being used by private space companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the Space Coast is enjoying a revival since the dire years after the space shuttle program was mothballed in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher J. Ferguson, a former astronaut who now heads <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s efforts to develop a new crew capsule for future launches, said he was excited to see the renewed activity. Communities along the Space Coast, he said, ''went through very trying times.'' Housing values plummeted and commerce ebbed. Even Shuttles, the space-themed restaurant and bar nearby on Merritt Island, shut down. Now the cold beer and cheeseburgers are back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is, for how long?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the Coast?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which leads to another obvious question: Why build billions of dollars worth of launch infrastructure on a risky coast in the first place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Safety and physics tell the tale. Launching over water is safer than over land and people. Also, rockets are best launched from sites closer to the Earth's fat Equator, where the greater diameter of the planet provides a slingshot effect that gives each rocket more bang for the propulsion buck. The Air Force was already firing missiles from Cape Canaveral when <span class="companylink">NASA</span> showed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of firing from Florida preceded space travel by nearly 100 years. In 1865, Jules Verne foresaw launches from Tampa in ''From the Earth to the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Verne, in fact, even envisioned a competition for the launch site between Florida and the Gulf Coast of Texas, with a pitched political battle for the plum program. In real life, Florida got the launches, and coastal Texas got the Johnson Space Center, home to mission control and astronaut training. Special barges from Michoud carried the oversize shuttle fuel tanks --too big for easy passage on rails or roads -- via the Intracoastal Waterway to Kennedy Space Center.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In images taken by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft when it flew past Pluto last July, scientists have spotted dendritic features that look as if they have been carved by liquids.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is another feature. ''We see what for all the world looks to a lot of the team like a former lake,'' said S. Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator. ''A frozen lake.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is among the findings that researchers presented Monday during a news conference at the Lunar and Planetary Science conference outside Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers are using computer simulations to show how liquid might have flowed on Pluto. ''Now we have the maps and a better understanding of the surface composition, we can turn sophisticated models to bear on our understanding of how Pluto has changed with time,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the models, Pluto's atmosphere, wispy today at just 1/100,000th of the atmospheric pressure of that at sea level on Earth, fluctuated wildly over millions and billions of years. At times, the pressure was dense enough that liquid nitrogen could exist on the surface, to flow as streams and pool as lakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unusual dynamics arise in part because of its extreme tilt -- 120 degrees, compared with 23 degrees for Earth. That creates wide tropical regions -- defined as places where the sun passes overhead sometime during the course of a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of Pluto is tropical,'' said Richard Binzel, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the New Horizons science team. ''We don't usually think about that, but most of Pluto is tropical.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, much of Pluto also lies within arctic regions, where the day is continuously dark part of year and continuously in sunlight other parts of the year. Interestingly, a dark band around Pluto's equator lies almost entirely outside the arctic regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings being presented at the conference build on those reported in papers published last week in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, the only ice is frozen water. On Pluto, nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide also freeze solid. That had been known for years. ''The ingredients that are there -- none of them surprise us,'' said William M. Grundy, of <span class="companylink">Lowell Observatory</span> in Arizona, who leads the team analyzing the composition of Pluto's surface on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons mission that flew past Pluto last July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deluge of data the spacecraft collected revealed a complex world with an unexpected diversity of landscapes, from flat plains to soaring mountainscapes. Scientists are beginning to study how the interplay of the different ices -- New Horizons's measurements also showed that the abundances of each varied from place to place -- shaped the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's really exciting for me is seeing how the ingredients interact among themselves to build this interesting geology,'' Dr. Grundy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most striking feature revealed on Pluto was a heart-shape region now named Tombaugh Regio after Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto. The left half is covered by mostly nitrogen snow, probably filling an ancient impact crater; the right side is more methane ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Pluto's ultrafrigid temperatures -- minus-390 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface -- water ice is rigid and unbending, like bedrock on Earth. But the other ices are more malleable, especially nitrogen. ''It's somewhat like Silly Putty,'' said Jeffrey M. Moore of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Ames Research Center in California, who leads the mission's geophysics and imaging team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The varying mixes of ices could form different alloys with very different properties, similar to how adding carbon transforms iron into steel, and that could help explain the wide range of topography. ''That's the new physics that needs to be learned,'' Dr. Grundy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nitrogen ice is also denser than water ice, so it could have flowed into cracks beneath the water ice bedrock, creating the jumbled blocks of mountains. Amid the flat plains in the middle of Tombaugh Regio are darker pieces, which could be icebergs of water ice floating on top of the nitrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nitrogen might also flow deep enough to be warmed by the interior and then erupt back at the surface -- producing what scientists are surmising might be an ice volcano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are studying a mountain named Wright Mons that rises two miles, is 90 miles across and has a hole at the center. ''It's not like any feature we've seen anywhere else in the solar system,'' said John R. Spencer, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ices on Charon, Pluto's largest moon, are much simpler. It's just water ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water ice also probably covers the four smaller moons: Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra. They turned out to be brighter, and thus smaller, than expected, ranging in reflectivity between fresh concrete and fresh snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also are spinning quickly with their axes tipped sideways, a configuration that defies easy explanation. ''We have no idea what that means yet,'' Dr. Spencer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another finding indicates that the upper atmosphere of Pluto is much colder, meaning that nitrogen escapes at a rate of about a hundredth of what had been expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the conference, Kelsi Singer, a postdoctoral researcher at the Southwest Research Institute, presented the counting of craters on Charon, Nix and Hydra that indicate all three are more than four billion years old.</p>

Now ''A Space Program'' offers a decidedly low-tech alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much installation video as documentary, Van Neistat's film is the record of an extended tongue-in-cheek simulation of a voyage to Mars by the artist Tom Sachs and a crew of assistants that was performed before an amused audience at the Park Avenue Armory in 2012. It comes at the front edge of a boomlet of Sachs openings: a solo show at the Noguchi Museum in Queens next Wednesday, and an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The installation itself paid homage to 20th-century engineering and applied science. From <span class="companylink">NASA</span> identity cards to excursion module to land vehicle, the Mars project created the components for Mission Control and each phase of the journey out of steel and plywood and found objects. Spacesuits, for example, were made from the Tyvek of many an overnight mailing envelope. ''Our space program is handmade,'' Mr. Sachs explains, ''guided by the philosophy of bricolage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever else the film carries, it packs some serious whimsy. The Mars landing is handled by an astronaut successfully completing an ancient <span class="companylink">Atari</span> video game; planetary explorations to gather and dispatch samples feature a handsaw and bottle rockets. Displaying primitive ingenuity, the movie recalls Georges Méliès and the early days of cinema. And as a tribute to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, ''A Space Program'' is rich in the core elements that have always propelled humanity's flights of fancy: imagination and the right tools.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, which consists of an orbiter that will measure methane and other gases in the Martian atmosphere and a lander that will study dust storms, lifted off at 3:31 p.m. local time on top of a Russian Proton rocket. <span class="companylink">The European Space Agency</span> broadcast the launch online.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main objective of Schiaparelli is to demonstrate its landing system. (<span class="companylink">The European Space Agency</span>'s last attempt to land on Mars -- the Beagle 2 spacecraft, which accompanied the Mars Express orbiter in 2003 -- failed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli carries instruments to measure Mars's atmosphere during the height of the dust storm season. Its batteries are expected to last only two to four days.</p>

Its instruments will measure gases, like methane, water vapor and nitrogen, that exist in minute quantities but that could hold important clues about the possibility of life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methane is the most intriguing trace gas. Sunlight and chemical reactions break up methane molecules in the atmosphere.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENT, Wash. -- The headquarters of Blue Origin, the secretive rocket company in an industrial park here, is anonymous, with not even a sign at the road to announce the occupants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, for the first time, Blue Origin, started by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, opened its doors to reporters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Welcome to Blue,'' Mr. Bezos said. ''Thank you for coming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin is part of a shift of the space business from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and aerospace behemoths like <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> toward private industry, especially smaller entrepreneurial companies. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, founded by another Internet entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has been the most visible and most successful of the new generation of rocket companies. Last Friday, it launched another satellite to orbit, but an attempt to land the booster on a floating platform again ended in an explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much more quietly, Blue Origin has also had big space dreams, but until now did not give outsiders a look at what it was doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For almost four hours, Mr. Bezos, who only occasionally talks to the press, led 11 reporters on a tour of the factory and answered a litany of questions over lunch. He talked garrulously, his speech punctured by loud laughs. ''It's my total pleasure. I hope you can sense that I like this,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described an image on a wall in the company's central area, which showed two tortoises holding an hourglass and gazing upward at a stylized image of the planets and cosmos. Below is Blue Origin's motto: ''Gradatim ferociter,'' Latin for ''step by step, ferociously'' -- no cutting of corners, but no dillydallying, either. ''You can do the steps quickly, but you can't skip any steps,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also offered updates on progress for his space tourism plans. The reusable New Shepard spacecraft that launched to the outskirts of space in November and then made a return trip in January will launch again soon. Depending on how well the testing goes, paying tourists, six at a time, might start making the short trips, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in space as soon as 2018, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, he told himself to stop talking, and let his engineers make their presentations about a new engine, the BE-4, which is under development with tests of a full version beginning by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos started Blue Origin in 2000, although few people knew about it then. For the next few years, about half a dozen people explored whether there might be a better way to get to space than rockets powered by loud, inefficient chemical combustion. The conclusion: there is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos said he had studied and thought about rockets since he was 5 years old. ''I never expected to have the resources to start a space company,'' he said. ''I won a lottery ticket called <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos declined to say how much money he had poured into his dream. ''Let's just say it's a lot,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 2005, Mr. Bezos said he began rocket development in earnest. Still, almost no one knew what he was doing. For years, what went on here was mysterious and unknown, like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory in Roald Dahl's children's book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally news would be tossed out to the outside world -- an award by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, a blog post by Mr. Bezos, a video of a successful launch. Last year, the company made a splashy public announcement at Cape Canaveral, Fla., when Blue Origin announced it would launch rockets into orbit from there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos talks about Blue Origin less as a business than as part of a glorious future for humanity, with millions of people living and working off the planet. It is also a path, he asserted, that humanity must pursue if it is to continue to prosper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His argument was simple: Energy consumption has been rising at 2 or 3 percent a year. Even at that modest rate, within a few centuries, the energy usage would be equal to the energy produced by high-efficiency solar cells covering the entire surface of the planet. ''We'll be using all of the solar energy that impacts the Earth,'' he said. ''That's an actual limit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is much energy and raw materials to use elsewhere in the solar system, and eventually, he prophesies, there will be the ''great inversion.'' Instead of factories on Earth manufacturing sophisticated components that go into tiny machines that go into space, the heavy manufacturing will all be done elsewhere, and Earth, he joked, would be zoned for residential and light industrial use, allowing much of Earth to return to a more natural state. ''It'll be universities and houses and so on,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is still far in the future. For now, Blue Origin's business plans fall in three categories. The first is space tourism, with short hops launching from West Texas on the New Shepard, a competitor to Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space start-up. Space tourism is not just a frivolity for the rich, but a necessary steppingstone to develop the expertise in a new technology, Mr. Bezos said, much like the early days of airplanes or how video games spurred the development of more powerful computer chips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, most rocket companies launch, at most, about a dozen times a year. ''You never get really great at something you do 10, 12 times a year,'' Mr. Bezos said. With a small fleet of reusable New Shepard rockets, Blue Origin could be launching dozens of times a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other business plans are for selling its rocket engines to other companies like <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, which is planning to use them for the Vulcan, a next-generation rocket to replace the Atlas 5 and Delta 4, and for its own larger rocket to lift payloads to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos said Blue Origin was quiet not necessarily to be secretive, but to avoid overpromising itself. ''Space is really easy to overhype,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tour would not be the last time the doors are open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later this year, Blue Origin will give more details about its designs for the larger rocket that will launch from Cape Canaveral, and Mr. Bezos said there would be an opportunity to watch a test flight of New Shepard in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will not be strangers,'' Mr. Bezos said at the end.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, he is to turn over command of the International Space Station to a fellow NASA astronaut, Timothy L. Kopra, and climb into a Russian Soyuz capsule. A few hours later, he will land in Kazakhstan, ending 340 consecutive days in space -- a record for a NASA astronaut.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous record was 215 days, reached by Michael Lopez-Alegria during a trip to the space station in 2006 and 2007. Counting his three previous trips to space, Mr. Kelly will have spent a total of 520 days in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll learn a lot about longer-duration spaceflight,'' Mr. Kelly said during a news conference on Thursday broadcast on NASA Television. ''I'd like to think this is another of many steppingstones to landing on Mars sometime in our future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the memorable sights from space included auroras and Hurricane Patricia in October, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more I look at earth, at certain parts of earth, the more I feel more of an environmentalist,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''There are definitely areas where the earth is covered with pollution almost all the time, and it's not good for any of us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, astronauts have spent six months, give or take, on the International Space Station. By studying Mr. Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, a Russian astronaut who is also part of this nearly one-year mission, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of what health issues astronauts might encounter during the six to eight months a trip to Mars would take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the absence of gravity, bones become more brittle, fluids in the body move upward and vision sometimes shifts toward farsightedness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are also interested in how quickly the astronauts readjust to gravity. After landing, Mr. Kelly will have a series of tests on his balance, including navigating an obstacle course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly said he was particularly intrigued by research on genetic changes that occur in space, which scientists will try to glean from comparisons with his twin brother, Mark E. Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with just two test subjects who spent 340 days in orbit, there will not be definitive answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We simply don't have that many people flying in space,'' Dr. Charles W. Lloyd, a NASA manager for communications about the agency's human research program, said in an interview. ''But we still need to understand how space potentially affects you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly is far short of the overall record for longest human space mission: nearly 438 days, by Valeri Polyakov on the Russian Mir space station in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yeah, I could go another 100 days,'' Mr. Kelly said when asked to reflect about Dr. Polyakov's record and whether he would be up for a longer stay. ''I could go another year if I had to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he conceded that the space station never fully became like home. ''Even after I've been here nearly a year, you don't feel perfectly normal,'' he said. ''There's always a lingering something you feel. It's not necessarily uncomfortable, but it is a harsh environment. For instance, having no running water. It's kind of like I've been in the woods camping for a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is done performing tests on him, Mr. Kelly said he was looking forward to jumping in his pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the hardest part of the mission was being physically cut off from friends and family. He said that for a Mars mission, in which crew members would be housed in a space much smaller than the space station, the privacy of their personal space would be important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Making that private area as perfect as possible, I think, will go a long way towards reducing fatigue, reducing stress and helping for a successful mission,'' Mr. Kelly said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next America's Cup sailing championship won't be contested until 2017 in Bermuda, but the preceding warm-up series of races, Louis Vuitton America's Cup World Series regattas, will come to New York May 7 and 8. Marking the occasion, the boat tour company Classic Harbor Line plans to offer ''speed sailing'' in April and May, fast boating with fewer passengers when the wind is above 10 m.p.h. The outings take place aboard the 85-foot schooner America 2.0 modeled on the original ship to win the race in 1851, and will carry half of the normal load of 80 sailors to keep the ship light and fast. Two-hour speed sailings will take place at 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. when conditions allow and will cost $52. They will launch April 22 and only take place in April and May, which are some of the windiest and best for sailing, according to the company.</p>

<span class="companylink">NASA</span> announced Friday it received a record number of applicants -- some 18,300 -- for its next astronaut class. That is more than double the record of 8,000 for the first space shuttle class in 1978. This time, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> hit social media hard to promote the openings. The odds of getting picked are small; eight to 14 Americans will be chosen. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> expects it will take a year and a half to whittle down the list.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a colonization plan from outer space. The Chinese government is relocating the villagers as it finishes building the world's biggest radio telescope, one of whose purposes is to detect signs of extraterrestrial life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope will be 500 meters, or 1,640 feet, in diameter, making it by far the largest instrument of its kind in the world. It is called FAST, short for 500-meter aperture spherical telescope, and will cost an estimated 1.2 billion renminbi, or $184 million, to erect. The government hopes to complete it by September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mass relocation was announced on Tuesday in a report by <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span>, the state news agency. The report said officials were moving 2,029 families, a total of 9,110 people, who live within about three miles of the telescope in the area of Pingtang and Luodian Counties in the southwestern province of Guizhou. Depopulating the area will create ''a sound electromagnetic wave environment'' for the telescope, <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials plan to give each person the equivalent of $1,800 for housing compensation, the report said. Guizhou is one of China's poorest provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China to relocate over 9,000 residents to protect world's largest radio telescope https://t.co/hLK8Ak0IKr[https://t.co/hLK8Ak0IKr] pic.twitter.com/DtfZuWZIkr -- China Xinhua News (@XHNews) February 16, 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forced relocations for large projects are common across China, and so are complaints about them and about the amount of compensation offered. The Three Gorges Dam displaced more than one million people along the Yangtze River, for example, and the middle route of the gargantuan South-North Water Diversion Project has resulted in the relocation of 350,000 people to make way for a series of canals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese government has announced ambitious plans for its space program, at a time when the American one's direction is uncertain. China aims to put an astronaut on the moon and a space station in orbit. The FAST project is another important element in the larger plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some official Chinese news reports about the project have emphasized the search for alien life, but the telescope's main scientific work will be somewhat less romantic, gathering large amounts of new data on a wide range of physical phenomena in space including pulsars, galaxies, black holes and gas clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope is being built in a wide depression among karst hills. The site is far from any large city, and ideal for picking up radio transmissions from the sky, the <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> report said. Scientists began looking for a suitable site for the project in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the truth is out there, some Chinese scientists are confident that the giant telescope will find it. For decades, professional and amateur scientists have combed the data gathered by the largest currently operational radio telescope in the world, the 53-year-old Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, hoping to find traces of intelligent life that, like mankind, may be advertising its existence to the universe through radio emissions. But they have yet to find any sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a larger signal receiving area and more flexibility, FAST will be able to scan two times more sky area than Arecibo, with three to five times higher sensitivity,'' Li Di, a chief scientist with the National Astronomical Observatories under the <span class="companylink">Chinese Academy of Sciences</span>, told China Daily last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new telescope should be able to pick up all kinds of radio signals more clearly from sources much farther away than can the Arecibo dish, which is 300 meters (about 1,000 feet) in diameter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, scientists successfully tested the new telescope's ''retina,'' which weighs 33 tons and is suspended 460 to 525 feet above the reflector dish, which was half-finished at the time, China Daily reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope is made up of 4,500 mostly triangular panels that measure about 36 feet on a side, the report said, which together create an immense parabolic dish. Scientists will be able to adjust the panels' positions to alter the shape of the dish and reflect radio signals from distant parts of the universe to a single focal point for detection and study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Li told China Daily that engineers were aiming to install all the panels by June and complete debugging the antenna by September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ultimately, exploring the unknown is the nature of mankind,'' he said, adding that it was ''as visceral as feeding and clothing ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It drives us to a greater future,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Mars rover Curiosity stuck its landing on the red planet on Aug. 6, 2012, it not only opened a new era of space exploration and a bright new door to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s future, but it also signified a triumph of human ingenuity over staggering odds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was virtually zero margin of error with the $2.5 billion project, as this new book about the Rover points out, and many things could have gone wrong with a mission that depended upon the work of more than 7,000 scientists and engineers, and about 500,000 lines of computer code.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being blasted into space by an Atlas V rocket on Nov. 26, 2011, Curiosity spent eight months hurtling some 354 million miles through space, plunging into Mars's atmosphere at a brutal 13,200 miles an hour. For the rover to alight safely in the chosen landing zone, everything had to work perfectly in an immensely complicated system known as E.D.L. (entry, descent and landing). The process involved rocket-powered deceleration, a giant parachute and a sky crane using nylon ropes to lower Curiosity gently onto the surface of Mars and set it directly down on its wheels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all sounded pretty crazy, as <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s top administrator observed, but, as it turned out, it was ''the right kind of crazy.'' For more than three and a half years now, the little rover has been working diligently, trundling across the surface of Mars, looking for evidence that the planet could have once supported life, and occasionally tweeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Right Kind of Crazy'' is the title of this engaging book, written by Adam Steltzner, an engineer leading the team at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (J.P.L.) that was charged with landing the Curiosity. Written with William Patrick, the book is an inside account of the intense decade of teamwork that went into Curiosity, and it's also the story of Mr. Steltzner's own unlikely journey -- from an aspiring musician, who barely graduated from high school, to a <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> recruit to a team leader at the J.P.L. in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though ''The Right Kind of Crazy'' is hobbled at times by the author's digressions into management-speak (the reader gets the feeling that he was encouraged to try to extrapolate all-purpose lessons about teamwork and leadership from his experiences), the book offers a gripping account of the Curiosity mission, and some fascinating insights into the engineering principles and analytics involved in pulling off the project. Mr. Steltzner -- who became known at J.P.L. for his Elvis hair, his cowboy boots and his swaggering style -- often talks less like a science geek than like the rocker he wanted to be as a teenager, and he displays a gift here for capturing the high-stakes, adrenaline-laced atmosphere of the Mars Science Laboratory, as the overall project was called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of racing the clock, which had been ''set by celestial mechanics'' (at one point, the launch date would have to be moved back from 2009 to 2011), Mr. Steltzner and his colleagues were faced with inventing a landing system for the car-size one-ton Curiosity, which was filled with delicate scientific equipment and way too heavy for the air-bag cocoons used in earlier rover missions. Along the way, there would be moments in what Mr. Steltzner calls the Dark Room -- that place where it's hard to ''egghead'' your way through a problem, and ''you know you have no solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months from launch (''a few seconds in spacecraft development time''), something went horribly awry in a simulated landing: Radar, crucial to the process, failed to kick in. After a string of all-nighters, examining ''every component for the source of the failure,'' Mr. Steltzner says, they found ''that all our incredibly sophisticated naughty bits had worked fine.'' There was nothing wrong with the spacecraft computer or the flight software or the algorithms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What hadn't worked was some run-of-the mill, everyday components'' of their test equipment. In this case, the problem was caught in time to save the mission; a similarly mundane mistake that went undiscovered (one team had used English units of measurement; another used metric units) led to the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the course of this book, Mr. Steltzner gives us an appreciation of the hard data and intuition involved in the engineering of a huge project like the Mars Science Laboratory -- and the way teams learned to break down seemingly impossible problems into smaller, more manageable ones. He writes that one of the difficulties with space exploration is that ''we never have enough iterations to allow us to fully learn from our mistakes.'' And he describes the technology necessary for landing the rover on Mars as ''tantamount to magic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He reminds us that the kind of life <span class="companylink">NASA</span> hopes to find on Mars ''has nothing to do with little green men or dudes who look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.'' Microbes, even fossilized microbes, would be ''an astonishing discovery.'' Life beyond Earth, he adds, would be ''a profound and comforting discovery'' -- comforting because ''it means if we screw up and ruin all life on Earth, we would not have destroyed the only living things in all existence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity hasn't found any actual life on Mars yet, but it did find an ancient stream bed and evidence that the planet could have supported microbial life billions of years ago. And the rover keeps toiling away, collecting samples, analyzing rocks and sending back spectacular photographs of the red planet, along with the occasional selfie. On the first anniversary of its safe landing on Mars, hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, the lonely little rover sang ''Happy Birthday'' to itself.</p>

It's the aircraft carrier next to the space shuttle and the nuclear submarine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid began life in 1943 as a Navy Essex-class carrier, during World War II. After suffering two kamikaze attacks, and later scooping up Scott Carpenter (along with his project Mercury capsule) in 1962 as well as Gus Grissom and his spacecraft in 1965, it spent some mature years in Vietnam. The vessel was later decommissioned but would serve as the F.B.I. operations center after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are always surprised that our offices are actually inside the aircraft carrier,'' said Jessica Williams, curator of the Intrepid's history and collections, as she walked past the windowless, slightly claustrophobic offices below the hangar deck, and into a storage facility housing thousands of artifacts. ''Each month we average about 10 collection donations from former crew members or their families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the notable such items below decks is a Vietnam-era helmet worn by an aviation machinist named Gerald Feola, who served for six months on the Intrepid in 1967. His job involved electronic countermeasures, which he would initiate from the back seat of an A-1 Skyraider aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would drop chaff,'' Mr. Feola recalled of his tour, ''which was essentially aluminum-foil-type material. As far as the enemy was concerned, it would falsely resemble hundreds of aircraft on their radar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feola's helmet features a hawk on one side and a crude chess knight on the other, a reference to his squadron's name: the VAW-33 Knight Hawks. Both were fashioned from green reflective tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The helmet is now too delicate for display. ''I brought it to the museum in a grocery bag, and they were appalled,'' Mr. Feola said. ''They immediately put on white gloves to handle something I used to let my grandkids play with.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wartime love letter on Intrepid stationery to his girlfriend, Arlene (now his wife), is prominently displayed in the museum. Mr. and Mrs. Feola now live in Staten Island, where they have a trove of correspondence from their courtship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The one in the museum is kind of dull,'' Mr. Feola admitted. ''But, you know, some of them aren't meant for public viewing, if you catch my drift.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Particulars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What It Is An A-1 Skyraider helmet, protective headgear worn by Gerald Feola in the Vietnam War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provenance The U.S.S. Intrepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circa 1967. Donated to the museum in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relegated Because The Styrofoam and rubber material in the helmet degrades easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where to Find It The helmet can be viewed by researchers or scholars upon request, at the Collection Storage Facility on the ship's second deck, at Pier 86 on West 46th Street and 12th Avenue.</p>

This time-lapse video, captured on Jan. 28, gives a sense of what is possible for those who rise very early -- or stay up very late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than three weeks the planetary quintet has pirouetted in the morning twilight, putting forth a dazzling display across the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial spectacle is expected to be visible through Feb. 20, but it's likely to be a better show this weekend than next.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to capture this time-lapse video, Benjamin Norman, a freelance photographer for The Times, teamed up with Stan Honda, an amateur astronomer and photography teacher with the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York. They met in Central Park at about 3:30 a.m. Eastern time. This video is a result of four hours of filming condensed into about two minutes. (All planet-gazers need not get themselves up quite so early. Around 45 minutes before sunrise is the recommended viewing time.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video began with the moon glowing center stage as bright as a spotlight. Jupiter, its closest partner, was positioned on the right while Mars was some distance to the left. As the morning progressed, the remaining planetary performers -- Saturn, Venus and Mercury -- filed behind the red disk. Mercury made its debut mere moments before dawn, when the sun's gaze swallowed the entire show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had the misconception that it's impossible to see anything but the moon while looking up in NYC,'' Mr. Norman said in an email. ''I think everyone thinks this. Well, I guess you just need to know where to look!''</p>

Many scientists active on social media did it by chirping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of gravitational waves was announced on Thursday by physicists associated with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory project. The experiment's two L-shaped antennas, in Louisiana and Washington state, detected a signal in September that resulted from a collision of two black holes more than a billion light-years from our spot in the universe. That reading could go a long way toward confirming a part of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disturbance that the antennas picked up was converted by LIGO researchers into sound waves, producing a chirping sound that is something like an interstellar ring tone that can be heard by anyone or anything in the universe listening for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the chirp we've been looking for. This is the signal that we measured." - Gabriela González, LSU and #LIGO https://t.co/4KMCzMNo3R[https://t.co/4KMCzMNo3R] -- NYT Science (@NYTScience) February 11, 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rumors of the discovery swirled before the announcement, and while they waited to hear it, scientists took to <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and other digital platforms to make their own chirps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend appears to have been kicked off by Katherine J. Mack, an astrophysicist in Australia. She wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> that she was practicing her ''gravitational wave binary inspiral chirp. For science,'' and shared a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Gravitational Wave Chirp Practice #chirpforLIGO Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a siege of herons or a bevy of larks, other physicists and science aficionados heeded her hashtag of #ChirpForLIGO and recorded their own sounds, many of which were captured in this <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> roundup:</p>

If true, it would have been the first scientifically confirmed report in history of someone being killed by a meteorite impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Tuesday, however, the story appeared to be fizzling as scientific experts weighed in.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early reports included images of a crater, five feet deep and two feet wide. Witnesses described hearing an explosion, and the police recovered a black, pockmarked stone from the site, in southeast India. The chief minister of the state, Jayalalithaa Jayaram, promised compensation for the families of the driver, who was hit by debris, and for the other three people, The Times of India reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the college in the Tamil Nadu district of Vellore, the driver, identified only as Kamaraj, died of his injuries after window panes in the engineering building and on several buses shattered, officials there told the local media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics were analyzing samples of the rock provided by the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Considering that there was no prediction of a meteorite shower and there was no meteorite shower observed, this certainly is a rare phenomena if it is a meteorite,'' said Prof. G.C. Anupama, the dean of the institute, in a telephone interview Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scientists in the United States were more emphatic, saying in a public statement that the photographs posted online were more consistent with ''a land based explosion'' than with something from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindley Johnson, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s planetary defense officer, said in an email that a death by meteorite impact was so rare that one has never been scientifically confirmed in recorded history. ''There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago,'' she said, referring to a 2013 episode in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, meteorites are often cool to the touch when they land, and the object recovered from the site in India weighed only a few grams and appeared to be a fragment of a common earth rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deaths and injuries by meteorites are tracked by the International Comet Quarterly, which notes the locations and sizes of meteorites. Some smash through houses, kill animals and spatter buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But deaths have been hard to confirm. In 1908 in Tunguska, Siberia, an apparent ''airblast'' of an object entering Earth's atmosphere leveled hundreds of square miles of forest and killed two men and hundreds of reindeer. But no meteorites were recovered, the quarterly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reports of people's limbs being amputated by meteorites, of farm animals being killed by them and of meteorites crashing through the roofs of houses. In 1954, a woman in Sylacauga, Ala., was hit by a particle from a meteorite that fell through the roof of her house. The object weighed nine pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteorites are fragments spawned from meteors -- they are basically pieces of space rock. In one of the largest recent events, meteorites fell in Chelyabinsk from a meteor that hit Earth's atmosphere in February 2013. About 1,200 people -- 200 of them children -- were injured, mostly by glass that exploded into schools and workplaces, according to <span class="companylink">Russia's Interior Ministry</span>.</p>

Coming from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s famed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, this app catalogs recent images of planets, moons, asteroids and other features of the cosmos, captured by NASA-affiliated space programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app has easy-to-use, icon-based navigation, and you can sort by either the top-rated images or the latest photos from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, like those still arriving from the Dawn spacecraft's mission to the dwarf planet Ceres. You can zoom in to explore the images in greater detail, and explanations about the photos are available with just a tap or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This app is science-forward, meaning it requires some concentration. It won't appeal to everyone, and children using the app may need an adult to explain some of the material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> apps offer interesting photos of our planet snapped from space, for a truly 21st-century space image experience check out EO Science 2.0 AR from the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> (free on iOS and Android). To use it, you first print out a special image and lay it on a surface in front of you. Then you launch the app, click start and point your smartphone's camera at the printout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app then shows you a 3-D augmented reality image of Earth spinning over the printout. You can move your phone to look around or zoom in on the image. Tapping on Earth changes the image to show different maps incorporating data obtained from space, including height and depth, land cover, and ocean chlorophyll concentrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EO Science 2.0 AR won't keep you occupied for long: While it's visually attractive, it doesn't contain much real science or explanation -- you'll have to search online for that information to better understand the maps. But the app is a lot of fun and will excite younger users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a completely different way to keep up with the latest news from orbit, take a look at Space, Astronomy and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> News from Newsfusion, which is free on iOS and Android. The app aggregates news stories from a long list of online sources and covers <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> news as well as breakthroughs in space science. Its interface has big, bold images and uses simple taps and swipes to navigate. You can even choose filters to see only the space news that's relevant to your interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And remember that winter nights can be perfect for exploring space using nothing more than your own eyes, if the weather is cooperative and skies are clear. To help you understand what you're seeing up there, check out my new favorite astronomy app: Night Sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billing itself as ''your own personal planetarium,'' Night Sky acts like a virtual reality guide to what you can see in the sky above you: When you hold your phone up it shows a view of the stars as seen from your location. It also contains news about coming stargazing events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app's detailed weather forecasting section predicts naked-eye star viewing conditions for the week ahead. And if you pay to upgrade to the pro version, the app offers even more features, including very detailed information about galaxies, planets, constellations, stars and satellites, all displayed in an attractive, image-heavy interface. Night Sky Lite is free on iOS and Android, but is limited in its features. The more complete versions cost $1 and up.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people living in the ancient city of Babylon, Marduk was their patron god, and thus it is not a surprise that Babylonian astronomers took an interest in tracking the comings and goings of the planet Jupiter, which they regarded as a celestial manifestation of Marduk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is perhaps more surprising is the sophistication with which they tracked the planet, judging from inscriptions on a small clay tablet dating to between 350 B.C. and 50 B.C. The tablet, a couple of inches wide and a couple of inches tall, reveals that the Babylonian astronomers employed a sort of precalculus in describing Jupiter's motion across the night sky relative to the distant background stars. Until now, credit for this kind of mathematical technique had gone to Europeans who lived some 15 centuries later.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is a truly astonishing find,'' said Mathieu Ossendrijver, a professor at <span class="companylink">Humboldt University</span> in Berlin, who describes his archaeological astronomy discovery in an article on Thursday in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a figure that describes a graph of velocity against time,'' he said. ''That is a highly modern concept.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mathematical calculations on four other tablets show that the Babylonians realized that the area under the curve on such a graph represented the distance traveled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's quite a remarkable discovery,'' said Alexander Jones, a professor at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, who was not involved with the research. ''It's really quite clear from the text.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ancient Babylon, situated in what is now Iraq, south of Baghdad, was a thriving metropolis, a center of trade and science. Early Babylonian mathematicians who lived between 1800 B.C. and 1600 B.C. had figured out, for example, how to calculate the area of a trapezoid, and even how to divide a trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids of equal area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, Babylonians used their mathematical skills for mundane calculations, like figuring out the size of a plot of land. But on some tablets from the later Babylonian period, there appear to be some trapezoid calculations related to astronomical observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1950s, an Austrian-American mathematician and science historian, Otto E. Neugebauer, described two of them. Dr. Ossendrijver, in his recent research, turned up two more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was not clear what the Babylonian astronomers were calculating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, a visitor showed Dr. Ossendrijver a stack of photographs of Babylonian tablets that are now held by <span class="companylink">the British Museum</span> in London. He saw a tablet he had not seen before. This tablet, with impressions of cuneiform script pressed into clay, did not mention trapezoids, but it recorded the motion of Jupiter, and the numbers matched those on the tablets with the trapezoid calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was certain now it was Jupiter,'' Dr. Ossendrijver said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Jupiter first appears in the night sky, it moves at a certain velocity relative to the background stars. Because Jupiter and Earth both constantly move in their orbits, to observers on Earth, Jupiter appears to slow down, and 120 days after it becomes visible, it comes to a standstill and reverses course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Dr. Ossendrijver went to <span class="companylink">the British Museum</span>, where the tablets were taken in the late 19th century after being excavated. A close-up look of the new tablet confirmed it: The Babylonians were calculating the distance Jupiter traveled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took Jupiter to travel half that distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ossendrijver said he did not know the astronomical or astrological motivation for these calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an abstract concept not known elsewhere at the time. ''Ancient Greek astronomers and mathematicians didn't make plots of something against time,'' Dr. Ossendrijver said. He said that until now, such calculations were not known until the 14th century by scholars in England and France. These mathematicians of the Middle Ages perhaps had seen some as yet unknown texts dating to Babylonian times, or they developed the same techniques independently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It anticipates integral calculus,'' Dr. Ossendrijver said. ''This is utterly familiar to any modern physicist or mathematician.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the trickiest aspects of getting the shot is simply knowing where to look for the headliners amid the countless bright orbs above.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- The two cameras sit on the Russian part of the International Space Station. They are named Theia and Iris. And they are available to hire out for ''space-based video surveillance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station is generally viewed as a benign, multinational floating science lab. A Canadian astronaut memorably recorded David Bowie's ''Space Oddity'' from there. More recently, the American astronaut Scott Kelly has been helping grow zinnias during his yearlong stay, and he conducted an amusing interview with Stephen Colbert this month.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is more to the station than spacemen strumming guitars and picking flowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Email traffic recently released by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> revealed that a Canadian company pitched an idea to the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s beleaguered border agency to use Theia and Iris for border surveillance. The company, called UrtheCast (pronounced ''earth cast''), has a deal with the space station's top Russian contractor, and operates the two cameras with the help of the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UrtheCast solicitation was among a number of business proposals made to the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s border agency, Frontex, since 2013, aimed at helping Europe police its increasingly porous borders. The proposals ranged from the mundane to the outlandish. Businesses offered drones, zeppelins, tethered balloons and a floating contraption tied to a truck with a rope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, a giant military contractor, contacted Frontex last year about what it called a ''floating frontier surveillance platform'' that could be used to monitor ''inland waterways, and estuaries, lakes.'' A Massachusetts company wanted to sell ''a field-deployable Rapid DNA Analysis System'' to generate DNA profiles ''in 84 minutes.'' A third company said it could create ''algorithms to predict border crossings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the most otherworldly idea belonged to UrtheCast. Its cameras, one for video and the other for still images, could be used for the ''detection of borders activities,'' UrtheCast said in an email to Frontex. UrtheCast said its cameras offered ''an unprecedented capability for an integrated persistent space surveillance,'' as well as what it called ''extraction of situation awareness at certain regions, facilities or events.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station was set up ''for peaceful purposes'' in 1998 by the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>. Is there a spy satellite lurking in its rafters? The UrtheCast solicitation pointed out that the cameras could ''help to provide reliable evidences on certain events without intruding'' on neighboring countries' air space with airplanes or drones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UrtheCast is hardly alone. More than 30 companies have been involved in commercial projects with the station, but those are generally research. Merck has studied antibodies, for example, and a subsidiary of Puma has tested coatings for golf clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Frontex said that the agency did not accept UrtheCast's offer, which was made in 2013, the year the cameras were launched into space from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Cosmonauts installed them the January after, though neither was fully operational for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it has been reported that the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span> keeps all of the images taken of Russia, an UrtheCast executive, Jeff Rath, would not confirm or deny that in an interview. Nor would he provide details about his clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't talk about our customers,'' Mr. Rath said. ''We'll sell to governments, and we'll sell to businesses,'' he said, as well as to nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pepsi</span> and <span class="companylink">Heineken</span> have used video from UrtheCast in commercials. And UrtheCast has signed a five-year, $65 million contract with an unnamed customer, according to Canadian securities filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of its most recent filings said that ''many government customers'' needed satellite imagery ''to supervise and manage, among other things, resources, animal migrations and national borders.'' A variety of customers used UrtheCast services ''to track environmental changes, natural disasters and human conflicts,'' the filing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got very strong support from our I.S.S. partners, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and <span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span>,'' Mr. Rath said, referring to the American and Russian space agencies. ''Our support has been unwavering from both.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Huot, a NASA spokesman, said in an email, ''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> did not have any involvement with the UrtheCast payload (it was pitched to and flown by our Russian colleagues) so I would have to direct you back to UrtheCast or <span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span> did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UrtheCast operates a subsidiary in Russia, and <span class="companylink">Sberbank</span>, the state-owned bank that is Russia's largest bank, owns more than 1 percent of UrtheCast's shares, according to <span class="companylink">Morningstar</span>, an investment research company. <span class="companylink">Fidelity</span>, an investment firm based in Boston, owns nearly 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The field of satellite imagery is competitive, since selling pictures from above is not as unusual anymore. In addition to dedicated spy satellites, there is a growing crop of companies with pictures to sell, or that offer their cameras for specific projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">DigitalGlobe</span>, a Colorado-based company, says its satellites ''are capable of collecting over one billion square kilometers of quality imagery per year.'' The California start-up <span class="companylink">Planet Labs</span> makes flocks of tiny satellites that it calls doves. <span class="companylink">Google</span> paid $500 million in 2014 to purchase Skybox Imaging, a provider of satellite imagery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 1,400 active satellites, according to the <span class="companylink">Union of Concerned Scientists</span>, a Washington environmental advocacy group that tracks satellites. They are used for all manner of purposes, like illuminating the effects of Somali piracy or revealing ancient earthworks in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These high-definition imaging satellites used to be the exclusive domain of the major space powers,'' said Laura Grego, a senior scientist at the <span class="companylink">Union of Concerned Scientists</span>. But now, Theia and Iris are becoming anything but space oddities. ''The satellite imagery business is in a lot of flux,'' she said.</p>

And it involved prop rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were very good at making rocks,'' Mr. Max said in a phone interview. ''We were able to cover camera positions and enhance the compositions with matching rocks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merging practical functionality with aesthetic form, Mr. Max and his team took some prototype designs from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and developed them with an eye for the future and what would look good cinematically. The look of the artificial habitat, or the hab, where the astronauts stay on Mars, was one example. Mr. Max spent some time in Houston at the Johnson Space Center and saw a basic version of a hab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was more about testing systems rather than the architecture,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They based the hab on those systems, but gave the design more style and elegance. The exterior included heavy amounts of padding that served as a shield from the thin, toxic atmosphere of Mars but let in sunlight. The style was modular because the hab parts would have to be sent on rockets and assembled there. That modular thinking was inspired by the style of the international space station. The interior was more uniform and compartmentalized. The layout included work stations for each of the astronauts, but was efficient in its use of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Hermes, the ship the astronauts use for their mission, the filmmakers also started with <span class="companylink">NASA</span> concepts and built them out. The ship's ion plasma particle engine sits on the back of a telescopic arm to keep the nuclear reactor that powers it as far away from the crew as possible. And solar panels use sunlight to help provide electricity on board. The overall effect is to make the ship look something like an arrow shooting through space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest design challenge, Mr. Max said, was the rotating module on the Hermes, which created artificial gravity through its circular acceleration. The design included a zero gravity corridor that would take the astronauts to different parts of the rotating hub. Part of this involved building physical sets that would move with hydraulics. The rest of the illusion was built through visual effects and shooting actors in harnesses against green screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the rover that Watney drives around Mars, the filmmakers also looked at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> prototypes for reference, but went their own way. The one in the film was faster, traveling 25 miles per hour as opposed to the 5 m.p.h. in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s versions. It uses wheel designs that the filmmakers saw in their research, an alloy honeycomb look, with some flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Max's team didn't recreate that technology, but instead used metal hubcaps that had a similar appeal. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s rover designs had many small wheels, but Mr. Max went with fewer, larger ones with a wider base. Each wheel could be steered individually and was functional for navigating rough terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They gave it their blessing, so we were allowed to put the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> logo on it,'' Mr. Max said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The designer said that he was pleased that in the same way <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had inspired his designs, his work had also inspired theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They said to me that they really liked a control panel I had done for the alien ship in 'Prometheus,' which was a wraparound cockpit idea,'' Mr. Max said. ''They copied that for one of their test panel control desks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the ship to the rocks and beyond, Mr. Max and his team used their research and skills to create a space experience that merged science with entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was quite a complicated project,'' Mr. Max said. ''Not as complicated as going to Mars, but almost.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There might be a ninth planet in the solar system after all, and it is not Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two astronomers reported on Wednesday that they had compelling signs of something bigger and farther away -- something that would satisfy the current definition of a planet, where Pluto falls short.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are pretty sure there's one out there,'' said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Dr. Brown and a fellow Caltech professor, Konstantin Batygin, have not done is actually find that planet, so it would be premature to start revising mnemonics of the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published in The Astronomical Journal, Dr. Brown and Dr. Batygin laid out a detailed circumstantial argument for the planet's existence in what astronomers have observed: a half-dozen small bodies in distant elliptical orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is striking, the scientists said, is that the orbits of all six loop outward in the same quadrant of the solar system and are tilted at about the same angle. The odds of that happening by chance are about 1 in 14,000, Dr. Batygin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ninth planet could be gravitationally herding them into these orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the calculations to work, the planet would be at least an equal to Earth, and most likely much bigger -- perhaps a mini-Neptune, with a small but thick atmosphere surrounding a rocky core and mass about 10 times that of Earth. That would be 4,500 times the mass of Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto, at its most distant, is 4.6 billion miles from the sun. The potential ninth planet, at its closest, would be about 20 billion miles away; at its farthest, it could be 100 billion miles away. One trip around the sun would take 10,000 to 20,000 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have pretty good constraints on its orbit,'' Dr. Brown said. ''What we don't know is where it is in its orbit, which is too bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alessandro Morbidelli of the Côte d'Azur Observatory in France, an expert in dynamics of the solar system, said he was convinced. ''I think the chase is now on to find this planet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would be the second time that Dr. Brown has upended the map of the solar system. In January 2005, he discovered a Pluto-size object, now known as Eris, in the Kuiper belt, the ring of icy debris beyond Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next year, the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> placed Pluto in a new category, ''dwarf planet,'' because in its view, a full-fledged planet must be the gravitational bully of its orbit, and Pluto was not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first indication of a hidden planet beyond Pluto had come a couple of years earlier. The Kuiper belt extends outward from Neptune's orbit, about 2.8 billion miles from the sun, to a bit less than twice Neptune's orbit, about five billion miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers expected that beyond lay mostly empty space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, they were surprised when Dr. Brown and two colleagues spotted a 600-mile-wide icy world at a distance of eight billion miles that remained well outside the Kuiper belt even at the closest point in its orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one could convincingly explain how the object, which Dr. Brown named Sedna, got there, and the hope was that the discovery of more Sedna-like worlds would provide enlightening clues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, astronomers looked and found nothing, deepening the mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, in 2014, Chadwick Trujillo, who had worked with Dr. Brown on the Sedna discovery, and Scott S. Sheppard, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> in Washington, reported a smaller object in a Sedna-like orbit, always remaining beyond the Kuiper belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Trujillo and Dr. Sheppard noted that several Kuiper belt objects had similar orbital characteristics, and they laid out the possibility of a planet disturbing the orbits of these objects. ''It was the best explanation we could come up with,'' Dr. Trujillo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the particulars of their proposed planet did not explain what was in the sky, Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The theorists didn't really take it seriously,'' he said. ''They figured it was all some observational effect. The observers didn't take it seriously, because they figured it was all some theoretical thing they couldn't understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the peculiarities of the orbits appeared genuine. Dr. Brown said he and Dr. Batygin ''sat down and beat our heads against the wall for the last two years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, they focused on the six objects in stable orbits and disregarded others that had been recently flung out by Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That made the picture clearer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They all point into the same overall direction,'' Dr. Batygin said. ''This is in stark contrast with the rest of the Kuiper belt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the long odds of this alignment being coincidental, Dr. Batygin said, this pattern would disperse over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That argued for the force of some unseen body guiding Sedna and the others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Batygin, a theorist, tried placing a planet among them using computer simulations, which scattered some Kuiper belt objects, but the orbits were not sufficiently eccentric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he examined what would happen if a ninth planet were looping outward in the opposite direction. That, Dr. Batygin said, gave ''a beautiful match to the real data.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computer simulations showed that the planet swept up the Kuiper belt objects and placed them only temporarily in the elliptical orbits. Come back in half a billion years, Dr. Brown said, and Sedna will be back in the Kuiper belt, while other Kuiper belt objects will have been pushed into elliptical orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another strange result in the simulations: A few Kuiper belt objects were knocked into orbits perpendicular to those of the planets. Dr. Brown remembered that five objects had been found in perpendicular orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're exactly where we predicted them to be,'' he said. ''That's when my jaw hit my floor. I think this is actually right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morbidelli said a possible ninth planet could be the core of a gas giant that started forming during the infancy of the solar system; a close pass to Jupiter could have ejected it. Back then, the sun resided in a dense cluster of stars, and the gravitational jostling could have prevented the planet from escaping to interstellar space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think they're onto something real,'' he said. ''I would bet money. I would bet 10,000 bucks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown said that he had begun searching for the planet, and that he thought he would be able to find it within five years. Other astronomers will most likely also scan that swath of the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the planet exists, it would easily meet the definition of planet, Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some truly dominant bodies in the solar system, and they are pushing around everything else,'' Dr. Brown said. ''This is what we mean when we say planet.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five planets will parade across the dawn sky early Wednesday in a rare celestial spectacle set to repeat every morning until late next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Headlining the planetary performance are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter. It will be the first time in more than a decade that the fab five will be simultaneously visible to the naked eye, according to Jason Kendall, who is on the board of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admission is free, though stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere should plan to get up about 45 minutes before sunrise to catch the show. City dwellers can stay in their neighborhoods to watch, as long as they point their attention to the east, according to Mr. Kendall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Mercury you will need binoculars,'' he said. ''It will not jump out at you, but everybody should be able to see Venus and Jupiter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kendall said that the hardest task for viewers will be discerning the planets from stars twinkling in the sky. But he offers a simple trick: close one eye, stretch out your arm and slowly pass your thumb over a bright dot in the sky. If the dot slowly dims out when your thumb passes over it, it's a planet. If it quickly blinks out, it's a distant star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is expected to run from Jan. 20 until Feb. 20, but the peak time to see all five is from the end of January until the first week of February, when Mercury is at its highest points, according to Sky &amp; Telescope. The display is made possible by the uncommon alignment of all five planets along what is called the ''ecliptic'' plane of their orbits according to Jim Green, the planetary science division director at NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each planet will appear in the sky one by one, starting Tuesday evening with Jupiter around 9:20 p.m. in New York. Mars will follow the gas giant's solo debut, appearing as a reddish dot at approximately 1:11 a.m. E.S.T. Wednesday. Saturn enters next around 4 a.m., followed by Venus -- the brightest orb -- nearly an hour later. Mercury will join the ensemble last, taking the stage at around 6:17 a.m. It will last until the sun rises, at about 7:15 a.m. on Wednesday in New York, and makes it too bright to see the planets. The display will appear in the sky at similar times across the East Coast and before dawn across the northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not super often you get to see them all at the same time in the sky, it's like seeing all of your friends at once,'' said Jackie Faherty, an astronomer from the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>. ''There they are, the other rocks or balls of gas that are running around the sun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who miss the planetary alignment this time around will have another opportunity from Aug. 13 to 19, when the cosmic motley crew gives an encore performance, according to EarthSky.org. That show will take place in the dusk sky, giving stargazers in the Southern Hemisphere the best vantage points.</p>

<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s next Mars mission will remain earthbound for at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at the space agency announced on Tuesday that its Mars InSight mission will miss its March 2016 launch date, because of stubborn tiny leaks in a vacuum sphere housing its seismic instrument.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just have run out of time,'' John M. Grunsfeld, the associate administrator for NASA's science directorate, said during a telephone news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a test on Monday at ultracold temperatures, about minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, a leak was again observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mars missions so far have largely explored the surface geology and properties of Mars. The instruments aboard InSight -- a shortening of Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport -- are designed to listen to what is going on in the deep interior of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mars, farther from the sun, takes longer to orbit, Earth and Mars will not be in alignment again for 26 months, in May 2018. Dr. Grunsfeld said it would take about two months to review the ramifications of the delay and the options of what to do next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $525 million of the mission's $675 million budget has been spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNES, the French space agency, is in charge of InSight's seismic instrument, which is to be placed on the surface to measure the vibrations of marsquakes and the impacts of meteorites. As with sonograms, the change of velocity of sound waves passing through the planet would enable scientists to infer the depths of Mars' crust, mantle and core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three seismometers in the instrument, sensitive enough to detect vibrations as slight as the width of an atom, require a near-perfect vacuum for precise measurements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seismometers sit within a sphere about nine inches in diameter. Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator, said that during tests of the instrument, still in France, air was pumped out to a pressure of about one ten-millionth of a millibar, or less than a billionth of the Earth's atmospheric pressure of about 1,000 millibars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of the mission, the vacuum would gradually rise by a factor of 10,000, to about a thousandth of a millibar, because of gases released within the instrument. Dr. Banerdt said the instrument would still function if the pressure were 100 times higher, at a tenth of a millibar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the leaks were large enough that the pressure inside rose to two tenths of a millibar over the course of a few days, ''which is by most standards a pretty darn good vacuum,'' Dr. Banerdt said. ''But for our purposes, we needed a better vacuum than that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers first discovered the leaks in August. Each time they thought they had sealed the last leak, another one appeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said that if the seismometers did not work, ''in some sense, we don't have a decision to make, because we're not ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, the manufacturer of the spacecraft, had already shipped InSight to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, where it was to be launched on an Atlas 5 rocket. The spacecraft will now probably be sent back to <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> in Denver and put into storage.</p>

On Monday night, they were treated to a new sight that may become common: a rocket coming back down to a gentle landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really felt like it was right on top of us,'' Elon Musk, the chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for short, said during a telephone news conference afterward.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the rush of sound from the rocket engines, Mr. Musk, who was at the launch site in Florida, said he initially thought the landing was a failure, ending with an explosion. But then he heard from mission control that the booster was standing, in one piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the 8:29 p.m. liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was a threefold success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, it marked the company's return to flight after half a year. In <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s last launch attempt, a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station disintegrated. (This time, the rocket was carrying a commercial payload: 11 small data-relay satellites for Orbcomm of Rochelle Park, N.J.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s upgraded design for its Falcon 9 rocket worked flawlessly. The liquid oxygen was chilled to minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit, about 40 degrees colder than on earlier flights, and the kerosene fuel was cooled to 20 degrees instead of 70 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk explained last week via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> that the lower temperatures improved performance of the rocket engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most significant to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s ambitions, however, is that after the second stage of the rocket with the satellites continued on to orbit, the engines of the booster stage reignited to turn it around, back to Cape Canaveral. Ten minutes after launching, it set down six miles to the south at Landing Zone 1, a former launch complex for Atlas intercontinental ballistic missiles that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Falcon has landed,'' a launch commentator said during <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s webcast as applause and cheers erupted at <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s California headquarters, followed by chants of ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had twice tried to land its Falcon 9 boosters on a floating platform in the Atlantic. Both times, the boosters reached the platform but fell short of a successful landing. The first time, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid, crashed and exploded. The second attempt was closer, but the booster tipped over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rocket stages can be refurbished and relaunched, the cost of traveling to space could be greatly reduced, Mr. Musk has said. He said <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> planned to refly the rocket booster. ''It'll be straightforward, actually,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said it would take a few years for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to sort through the process of reusing rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> plans two launches next month: another commercial satellite and an ocean science satellite for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>. It aims to resume supply missions to the space station in February.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Curiosity rover treks up a three-mile-high mountain on Mars, the rocks are changing. That says something about how the planet's climate and environment changed more than three billion years ago -- but scientists are not sure what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since it landed more than three years ago in a 96-mile-wide depression known as Gale Crater, Curiosity has made a number of discoveries, notably that the crater once held lakes of fresh water. For most of that time, the rocks it encountered were generally basaltic, a volcanic composition typical on Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now in the recent few months, that has changed,'' Ashwin R. Vasavada, the project scientist for the mission, said at a news conference on Thursday at a meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Geophysical Union</span> in San Francisco, where researchers were presenting some of their newest results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have surprising clues but no definitive story, yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attraction of Gale Crater to planetary scientists is the mountain at the center. A space rock slamming into Mars created the crater about 3.6 billion years ago. It then filled with sediment, which was subsequently carved away by the wind, leaving behind the formation known as Mount Sharp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each layer of sedimentary rock tells something about the geological conditions at the time the rock formed, meaning that Curiosity, which arrived at the base of the mountain in September 2014, is in a sense moving forward through the geological history of Mars as it climbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has caught the attention of Dr. Vasavada and his colleagues lately is silica, a class of minerals made of silicon and oxygen. The evidence points to the action of liquid water even after the lakes disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Groundwater passed through the rock multiple times, leaving different chemical signatures behind,'' Dr. Vasavada said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basalt is generally half silica. Curiosity has been examining two rock units: one a mudstone of lake bed deposits, among the oldest rocks the rover will examine, and the other a sandstone of coarse grains that were blown in and draped onto the mountain. ''It probably is among the youngest rocks we'll encounter on the mission,'' Dr. Vasavada said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mudstone and the sandstone, Curiosity found much higher levels of silica, up to 90 percent more than it had observed previously in basaltic rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of this we're just beginning to piece together and understand,'' Dr. Vasavada said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After arriving at a spot the scientists named Marias Pass, an intersection between the older mudstone and younger sandstone near the base of the mountain, Curiosity spied a patch of light-toned bedrock, part of the mudstone. It fired a laser to vaporize the rock in several places; the instrument identifies the constituent elements from the colors of light given off. Then Curiosity drove off to do more science elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on Earth, scientists analyzing the data realized this was something different: It turned out to be the first of the high-silica rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The science team decided to make the rare decision to go back and investigate this more,'' said Jens Frydenvang, a member of the science team from <span class="companylink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span> and from the <span class="companylink">University of Copenhagen</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity drilled into a rock target called Buckskin and scooped up the bits for more detailed examination with its onboard chemistry laboratory. Silica comes in many different forms, and the particular form can tell the conditions when the rock became a rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So we all placed friendly bets on what sort of silica phase we would find,'' said Elizabeth Rampe, another member of the science team for Curiosity. ''But we could never have predicted this result.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was tridymite, a mineral that is rare on Earth and has never seen before on Mars. ''And we actually found a lot of it,'' Dr. Rampe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, tridymite generally forms at high temperatures in volcanic or metamorphic rocks, not a finely layered sedimentary rock like Buckskin. That may tell something about the origin of the sediments, or it is possible that tridymite forms through a different process on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the younger sandstone, the scientists found a different type of silica known as Opal-A along fractures in the rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists hypothesize two possibilities: acidic water washed away the other elements, or neutral water washed in silica that accumulated in the sandstone. ''They both involve liquid water,'' said Albert Yen of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, another science team member. ''We're just trying to figure out the flavor of the water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists did not present new findings on organics, the carbon-based molecules that could serve as the building blocks for life. Dr. Vasavada said that signs of organics had been spotted, but the scientists were still analyzing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Stay tuned,'' he said. ''There are organics in several of these samples we've been seeing lately.''</p>

See, for example, the recent discoveries of Dreadnoughtus schrani (the biggest dinosaur) and EGS-zs8-1 (the farthest galaxy). But this year, as <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft sped through the outskirts of the solar system, a cherished underdog stole the show: the dwarf planet Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, after a nine-year, three-billion-mile journey, New Horizons flew by Pluto at more than 30,000 miles per hour, transmitting back to Earth a treasure trove of stunning images and fascinating data, which continue to arrive. In fact, the sharpest views of Pluto are reaching us only now, five months after the all-too-brief close encounter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto's turn in the limelight is a heartwarming moment for champions of the cosmic downtrodden. Discovered by the American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was considered a planet until 2006, when the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> voted to reclassify it as a dwarf planet, in part to avoid having to elevate the stature of several newly discovered objects of similar size on the fringes of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many reacted negatively to Pluto's demotion. Schoolchildren called prominent scientists heartless. Comedians made bad jokes about Pluto being banished to a doghouse in the sky. Protesters, along with the widow and son of Clyde Tombaugh, gathered on the campus of <span class="companylink">New Mexico State University</span> (where Professor Tombaugh taught), some carrying placards that read ''Size Doesn't Matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several state legislatures even adopted resolutions affirming Pluto's planethood, notwithstanding the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>'s new definition. The Illinois Senate's resolution included an appeal to patriotism, pointing out that Professor Tombaugh was the ''only American to ever discover a planet.'' The Assembly of the State of California was more philosophical, expressing concern for the ''psychological harm to some Californians who question their place in the universe and worry about the instability of universal constants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this summer, all such worries were forgotten: Pluto was back with a vengeance. The glamour shots from New Horizons transformed Pluto from a fuzzy point of light to a full-fledged world with a distinct identity. Scientists offered breathless commentary as close-up images revealed a variety of geological phenomena, including vast plains dotted with craters and flowing glaciers, and huge chasms and tectonic ridges on Charon, the biggest of Pluto's five moons. Looking at the images, you could almost imagine trekking through the icy terrain of the Texas-size region called the Sputnik Planum and staring out at the crumpled mountain ridges in the distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists will pore over the New Horizons data for decades, but they have shared some early findings already. We have learned that Pluto is a bit bigger, and less dense, than most previous estimates, making it the largest solar system object beyond Neptune, at least for now. In addition, it turns out that Pluto's sky features widespread hazes, rich in hydrocarbons like acetylene and ethylene. A plasma cloud trails the dwarf planet for tens of thousands of miles, as the solar wind slowly strips away its already-tenuous atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Pluto's attributes are easier to make sense of than others. Researchers believe that complex hydrocarbon compounds account for the reddish hue of Pluto's surface, but the unusual properties of its small moons defy easy explanation (they spin faster, and wobble more, than scientists expected). It also came as a surprise to many that the New Horizons flyby did not uncover any more moons, beyond the five already known. Meanwhile, scientists are pondering new evidence that suggests that some of Pluto's mountains might be ''ice volcanoes,'' spewing not lava but a slurry of frozen water and other ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who mourned Pluto's downgrade, its return to the fore is sweet revenge. The wow factor of the New Horizons data is undeniable, especially in the case of a magnificent parting shot of Pluto, with streaming sunlight throwing into relief its rugged inhospitable landscape and many layers of atmospheric haze. Thanks to these revelations, rather than lamenting Pluto's identity crisis, now we can focus on its many splendors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tony Bruno, president of <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, which made the rocket, urged, ''Everyone cross your fingers and think happy weather thoughts.''</p>

The launchpad at Wallops Island, Va., was badly damaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, <span class="companylink">Orbital</span>'s unmanned spacecraft, Cygnus, is flying on top of a competitor's rocket, an Atlas 5 built by the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liftoff is scheduled for 5:55 p.m. Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Forecasters said there was a 40 percent chance that unsettled weather could postpone the launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it gets off the ground on Thursday, the cargo spacecraft is to arrive at the space station on Sunday, greeted by the six astronauts on board: two Americans, three Russians and one from Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlas 5 is a more powerful rocket, and an upgraded Cygnus capsule, about three and a half feet longer, has 25 percent more cargo space than earlier <span class="companylink">Orbital</span> flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo on the Cygnus includes small satellites to be deployed from the space station; a new jetpack for astronauts during spacewalks; high-pressure nitrogen and oxygen tanks for the space station's air supply system; and Microsoft HoloLens visors, ''mixed reality'' devices that project holograms to appear next to real, physical objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one mode, the visors will allow controllers on the ground to see exactly what an astronaut is seeing. Experts on the ground can then draw annotations that show up in an astronaut's field of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second mode, animated holograms could act as a real-time, three-dimensional instruction manual, potentially simplifying and speeding training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science experiments include one that will test the effectiveness of flame-resistant fabrics in space. In the absence of gravity, flames and combustion behave differently than on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo flight will also take up a new laboratory for the study of bacteria and other micro-organisms, cells and tissues, and small plants and animals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the small satellites on the Cygnus was built by students from prekindergarten through eighth grade at St. Thomas More Cathedral School in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the Cygnus is to undock from the space station carrying 3,000 pounds of trash. By design, it will burn up while re-entering Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Orbital</span> is to launch one more time on top of an Atlas 5 rocket next spring, and then plans to resume launching its Antares rocket. <span class="companylink">Orbital</span> will no longer use the old Soviet-era engines, having revamped the Antares design with newer, more powerful RD-181 engines from Russia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has been grounded since June when a Falcon 9 rocket carrying supplies for the space station broke apart in flight, because of the failure of a strut within the second-stage liquid oxygen tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s next cargo delivery for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, which will include an inflatable module to be added to the space station, will not occur until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Russian Progress cargo rocket failed in April, but another Progress successfully launched in July. Because of cargo launches by Russia and Japan, the astronauts on the space station have not run out of supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference Wednesday, Kirk Shireman, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s space station program manager, said toilet supplies would last until February and food until April. ''We're not overly concerned at this point in time,'' he said, ''but we're not as robust as we would like to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> originally awarded <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> a $1.6 billion contract for 12 flights, and <span class="companylink">Orbital</span> -- then known as the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> -- a $1.9 billion contract for eight flights.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By a stroke of good fortune, we somehow got visas for the U.S., so to East Boston. I was 12, the only Asian in a very rough school. My father washed dishes. At school, people made fun of me. That made me determined to learn English quickly enough to get into a better school, which I did. I got into the best one in the city, the Boston Latin School. From there I went to Harvard, where it seemed as if I was the only person who wasn't rich and worked. It felt like wherever I went I was the outsider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When did that end for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day at Harvard, I stumbled into a lecture about the black holes in the Milky Way. I was absolutely captivated. I sought out the lecturer, Paul Ho [no relation], and he immediately gave me a research project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things I loved about astronomy was that it was not tied to the mundane. It was not even tied to our planet. Maybe this was a reaction against all the day-to-day things my family had to struggle with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What area of astronomy did you work in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes. I was one of the first people to show how common they are. This was one of the results of my doctoral thesis in 1995. Before, the thinking was that they should exist but that they were really very rare. I was able to demonstrate that every big galaxy has a nucleus containing supermassive black holes. This was suspected before, but I was able to prove it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did you accomplish that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By searching for an indirect way to show their existence. I looked for signs of energy, and what I found was that basically every galaxy had a black hole. We just hadn't seen it before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After I finished my doctorate, the Hubble Space Telescope was repaired. It made it possible to measure the rotation speed of the stars and gas around those black holes. The Hubble confirmed many of the points of my thesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How central are black holes to understanding what the universe looks like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're learning they are to be considered to be one of the key ingredients that make galaxies look the way they do. The big question is, how can something so tiny like a black hole influence the entire galaxy itself? The belief now is that they know how to talk to one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are living in an era of tremendous breakthroughs in our knowledge of the universe. Why are we learning so much now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of it is technology-driven. Astronomers have a lot of very nice new toys. The rapid development of astronomy is completely tied to access to big telescopes. That's one reason why I urged China's leaders to partner on one of the big new international telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has great scientific ambitions. It's an unwritten rule that to be part of the astronomy club, you need to be part of a big telescope. It wasn't an easy sell. The three new telescopes that were coming were all to be on foreign soil, and that was a difficult concept. They eventually choose to join with Caltech, the University of California, Canada and India on the Thirty Meter Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you were growing up, did you ever think you'd come to live and work in China?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not ever. One of the things that influenced me was meeting so many talented young Chinese scientists. I helped some get into American universities. I could relate to their struggles here. When they returned to China, it wasn't always possible for them to succeed. There was a mismatch between their talents and opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, things have begun to change. China has made large science investments, and these people now have something to go back to. In 2013, when the Kavli people approached me, I felt I might have something to contribute to an environment like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What appealed to you about the foundation's offer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It actually was very unappealing. It came at the worst possible moment. My wife and I had just had a baby. There were older kids in high school. They could not be uprooted. The job meant living in Beijing, with its pollution, traffic and cramped apartments. My wife, who stayed behind, said, ''We'll just have to make it happen.'' My wife didn't want me to lose this opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It involves a lot of juggling. To save commuting time, I sleep at my <span class="companylink">Peking University</span> office. I get up at 5 a.m. to Skype my daughter. I tutor my son via the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I return to California every two months to see them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese education has a reputation for being mechanistic and rigid. Have you found it that way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had a very rigid system because, in a different time, that's what worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know what made Carnegie an effective center for astronomy research. It was an environment that allowed a lot of free discussion and brainstorming. I'm trying to bring some of that to our institute in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My dream is that 20 years from now, the best students from Harvard and Princeton will want to go to <span class="companylink">Peking University</span>, not the reverse. What my institute can do is provide an oasis where I can expedite the process, because I have more control over this little patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the Chinese system can evolve, and Kavli is providing one model. We have nonhierarchical interactive discussions. We've attracted very high-level visitors to lecture and teach. Already, our Kavli Institute attracts many non-Chinese postdocs, and they want to come here because they see the ferment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing is that China now has the means to invest in science. And it is willing to do so! Even in the most advanced countries, basic astronomy is a hobby science. Yet in China they are willing to spend on it. With that and these great human resources, the trick is to combine them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a lifetime of travel and displacement, do you feel at home in Beijing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's where I hope I can find a home. That's why I work so hard to make the program successful. I am there for the long haul. I've been learning to speak and write the language. Funny thing: The last time I returned I actually missed the place. A year ago, it was the most alien place to me.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon's orbit is askew, and two planetary scientists believe that they have come up with a good reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intriguingly, their idea also explains why gold and platinum are found in the Earth's crust, well within diggable reach.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon is believed to have formed out of a giant cataclysmic collision early in the history of the solar system when an interplanetary interloper the size of Mars slammed into Earth and lofted a ring of debris circling over the Equator. The debris coalesced into the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its birth, the moon was quite close to the Earth, probably within 20,000 miles. Because of the tidal pulls between the Earth and moon, the moon's orbit has slowly been spiraling outward ever since, and as it does, Earth's pull diminishes, and the pull of the sun becomes more dominant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, with the moon a quarter million miles from Earth, the sun's gravity should have tipped the moon's orbit to lie in the same plane as the orbits of the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has not. The moon's orbit is about 5 degrees askew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That the lunar inclination is as small as it is gives us some confidence that the basic idea of lunar formation from an equatorial disk of debris orbiting the proto-Earth is a good one,'' said Kaveh Pahlevan, a planetary scientist at the Observatory of the Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. ''But the story must have a twist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in this week's issue of the journal Nature, Dr. Pahlevan and his observatory colleague Alessandro Morbidelli propose the twist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon did indeed form in the Earth's equatorial plane, the scientists said, but then a few large objects, perhaps as large as the moon, zipping through the inner solar system repeatedly passed nearby over a few tens of millions of years and tipped the moon's orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of computer simulations show that the idea is plausible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This mechanism works for a broad range of physical conditions,'' Dr. Pahlevan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually the crisscrossing mini-planets would have been tossed out of the solar system, swallowed by the sun, or slammed into the Earth or the other planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin M. Canup, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who wrote an accompanying commentary in Nature, said the thousands of close passes that typically occur before an impact were a ''really new realization'' by Dr. Pahlevan and Dr. Morbidelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While a single scattering event will only change the moon's tilt slightly,'' Dr. Canup said, ''it's the cumulative effect of these many passes that can produce this tilt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scars of one or more moon-size objects hitting Earth would have long been erased by the tectonics of the shifting surface, but those impacts would explain the gold, platinum and other precious metals in the Earth's crust but not on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metals on the early Earth should have sunk to the interior. Thus, planetary scientists think that after the moon was created, later collisions that provided the last 1 percent or so of the Earth's mass added a veneer of precious metals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of lunar metals argues for a few large metal-rich objects hitting the Earth rather than many small ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computer simulations show that the chances of the moon's getting hit are low. In the simulations, if there was one object buzzing by, the moon was hit 9 percent of the time. With four objects, the chances of a lunar impact rose to 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not an overly likely outcome, which is good,'' Dr. Canup said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists including Dr. Canup had proposed other explanations for the tilt. ''I would say those relied on certainly more complex processes and required rather narrow sets of conditions for success,'' Dr. Canup said. ''I think where this has really stepped in is it's a very simple mechanism.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, Jeffrey P. Bezos' rocket went up -- and it came down in one piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has been investing some of his wealth in space dreams, establishing a rocket company called Blue Origin. On Monday, Blue Origin launched its New Shepard rocket, named after Alan Shepard, the first American to reach space in a similar suborbital flight in 1961.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket lofted a capsule that is to eventually carry paying passengers on suborbital jaunts to a height of 329,839 feet, or 100.5 kilometers, above its launch site near Van Horn in West Texas. That is just above the 100-kilometer altitude that is considered the beginning of outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capsule descended to the ground under parachutes 11 minutes after blasting off. The rocket itself turned around and, firing its engines again, set back down at the launchpad at 4.4 miles per hour -- faster than a person strolling, but gentle enough to prevent damage. It landed less than five feet from its target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a totally nominal flight,'' Mr. Bezos said in an interview. ''We're walking on cloud nine. There wasn't a dry eye in the house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This builds on a largely successful test flight in April. In that operation, the launch and the landing of the capsule were flawless, but the rocket crashed because of a failure with a hydraulic system. Mr. Bezos said engineers had replaced the hydraulics with a new design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Think of this as the beginning of a thorough test program,'' Mr. Bezos said. The next flight, he said, ''should be a matter of weeks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, based in Kent, Wash., south of Seattle, is selling space on the capsules during the test flights for research experiments, and it plans to begin flying them next year. ''There's no reason not to do that,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial flights for tourists, also to launch from West Texas, could begin in a couple of years. Blue Origin has not started selling tickets or decided the cost of a flight, which would provide about four minutes of floating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like another upstart rocket company, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, Mr. Bezos and Blue Origin are betting that reusable rockets can greatly reduce the cost of getting to space. Most rockets today fly just once, crashing back to earth after exhausting their fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ultimate vision should be aircraftlike operations,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has taken a similar approach in trying to recover the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets, coming close to landing them on a floating platform in the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same technology is to be used in a larger Blue Origin rocket that is to be launched to orbit from Cape Canaveral in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything that we have learned here on New Shepard is completely applicable to our orbital booster,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin officials have not spoken in detail about which markets they are aiming for with the bigger rocket, but Mr. Bezos has said his passion is to send people to space. The company could also compete for commercial and military satellite launches.</p>

But the astronaut who raced 900 miles to Florida to challenge her romantic rival in an airport parking lot -- well, who doesn't remember her?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any one of those real-life stories of aberrant obsession might have been enough to fill a musical. But Fred Sauter and Paul Leschen (''Bedbugs!!!'') have commandeered all three to make ''The Astronaut Love Show,'' a 100-minute musical satire that thinly disguises the astronaut Lisa Nowak as Leslie Starvak (Amber Martin); the cannibal Armin Meiwes as Arvin Meissner (Mark Rinzel); and the accused kidnapper Joyce McKinney as June Bernice McNealy (Samantha Stoltzfus).</p>

But the stories also resist being sent up, since they're so over-the-top outlandish to begin with. What they need is to be shaded with sympathy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sauter and Mr. Leschen seem to understand that, but John de los Santos's manic sketch-comedy-style production at the Kraine Theater doesn't rise to the task. Cranking the craziness up to 11 almost from the start, it lunges for laughs, not trusting in the reasons these bizarre stories captivated audiences in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was never only shock value. It was also that we recognize how slender and precarious the line between normal and abnormal can be. We know what it is to be overcome by loneliness or desperation, to be suffused with heartache or lust. We probably wouldn't go as far as any of these three to try to assuage those feelings, but what if we ever did lose control?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might seem too earnest a response, but the parts of ''The Astronaut Love Show'' that work best go deeper than mere ridicule. Unlikely as it may seem, the cannibal Arvin is by far the most moving character here, because Mr. Rinzel makes us see his sadness and isolation -- but that doesn't keep him from being funny. The one time I laughed out loud was during a scene of bloody mutilation.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON four Thursdays in November 1915 -- one lecture each week -- Albert Einstein rose to the podium at the Prussian Academy of Sciences to deliver updates on what he came to call his ''general theory of relativity.'' He was working at a frenzied pace, adjusting details between each presentation. By the end of the month, he had arrived at a form for his equations that physicists still use today. Elegant and crisp, they are brief enough to tweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 100 years since, Einstein's theory has been famously successful. Physicists and astronomers have applied general relativity to far-flung reaches of the cosmos, and no experiment or observation has yet revealed a discrepancy. Less commonly understood, however, is how thoroughly the research into this profound, abstruse and seemingly otherworldly theory was shaped by the messy human dramas of the past century.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the outset, Einstein was not optimistic that his theory would be quickly accepted. ''The theory of gravitation will not find its way into my colleagues' heads for a long time yet, no doubt,'' he lamented to a friend in 1915.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the barriers to acceptance were conceptual. Isaac Newton had argued that there was a universal force of gravity, the incessant tugging of one body on another. But Einstein argued that there was no ''force'' of gravity at all. Space and time were as wobbly as a trampoline; they could warp, bend or distend in the presence of massive objects like the sun. Objects simply moved as straight as they could, flowing through curved space-time. This idea could be hard to wrap your head around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other obstacles were political. The turmoil and disruptions of World War I, for example, prevented many people from learning and thinking about general relativity. The theory's earliest converts included a Russian mathematician being held in a German prisoner-of-war camp, who was unable to enlighten his Russian colleagues for several years; a German astronomer being held in a Russian prisoner-of-war camp, who was unable to complete his test of one of the theory's key predictions; and another German astronomer, who passed the time while serving in the German Army by finding the first exact solutions to Einstein's equations, only to succumb to a deadly disease on the Russian front a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The war also controlled how Einstein's work spread westward. Because he was a German civil servant, neither Einstein nor his letters -- nor even German scientific journals -- could cross the English Channel amid the naval blockade. Einstein could, however, travel to neutral countries, like the Netherlands. He made frequent trips to Leiden, where he befriended the great mathematical physicist Willem de Sitter and tutored him in general relativity. And de Sitter, in turn, sent a series of detailed primers on Einstein's work to a Cambridge colleague, the physicist and astronomer Arthur Eddington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eddington, a Quaker and conscientious objector, was concerned that wartime resentments were damaging the international scientific community. He leapt on Einstein's relativity as a means of restoring harmony. As the historian Matthew Stanley has documented, Eddington's superiors in London and Cambridge lobbied <span class="companylink">British government</span> officials to let him devote his mandatory wartime service to preparing an astronomical expedition to test one of Einstein's major predictions, that gravity could bend the path of starlight. By leading a British team to test the work of a German physicist, Eddington hoped to ''heal the wounds of war.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year after the armistice that ended World War I, Eddington announced that his team's measurements of the apparent positions of stars during a recent eclipse matched Einstein's predictions. In an interview soon afterward, Einstein noted that the public recognition of his accomplishment had a political slant. ''Today I am described in Germany as a 'German servant,' and in England as a 'Swiss Jew,' '' he said. ''Should it ever be my fate to be represented as a bête noire, I should, on the contrary, become a 'Swiss Jew' for the Germans and a 'German servant' for the English.'' Here, he shared with a wink, was yet another application of the theory of relativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, events quickly proved Einstein right. Just months after Eddington's announcement, right-wing political opportunists in war-ravaged Germany began to organize raucous anti-Einstein rallies. Only an effete Jew, they argued, could remove ''force'' from modern physics; those of true Aryan spirit, they went on, shared an intuitive sense of ''force'' from generations of working the land. Soon after the Nazis seized power in 1933, they banned the teaching of Einstein's work within the Reich. Einstein settled in Princeton, N.J.; the German relativity community was decimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After World World II, a new generation of physicists in the United States began to focus on relativity from their perch within the ''military-industrial complex.'' Here, political exigencies accelerated a deeper appreciation of Einstein's theory, in unanticipated ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one example, physicists and engineers working on enormous radar arrays to detect incoming Soviet missiles calibrated and fine-tuned their new system by sending radar pulses to nearby planets. These researchers realized that if they timed the return echo from the planets with unprecedented accuracy, they could test a subtle prediction of Einstein's: that gravity slows the speed of light as well as bending its path. For decades, this ''time-delay'' test provided the most precise measurements available that space-time really did behave as Einstein predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years later, theoretical physicists briefed <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> generals on a subtle complication with a new military technology, the Global Positioning System. Effects from Earth's gravity would be stronger on the ground than in orbit, the physicists explained, and hence clocks on the ground would tick more slowly than those aboard satellites. If the clocks disagreed on time, they would also disagree on space, and that could spell trouble for this technology. If left uncorrected, the tiny differences in clock rates would snowball into enormous errors in determining distances. With GPS, the warping of time that Einstein imagined assumed operational significance. (Later, GPS was opened to the commercial market, and now billions of people rely on general relativity to find their place in the world, every single day.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century after its creation, Einstein's beautiful theory continues to inspire lofty thoughts -- about black holes, supernovae, the big bang. The history of Einstein's work, however, reveals how even the most abstract scientific research can be buffeted, derailed and even propelled by the most potent force of all: politics.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air on Mars -- what there is of it -- is leaking away, about half a pound a second sputtering into space, scientists announced on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet's early atmosphere is thought to have been as thick as or thicker than Earth's today, and even over the 4.5-billion-year history of the solar system, that slow leak would not explain how it atrophied to its current wisps.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new readings from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission -- Maven, for short -- show that when Mars is hit by a solar storm, the ferocious bombardment of particles from the sun strips away the upper atmosphere much more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could help explain the disappearance of the atmosphere. The sun during its youth was more unsettled, with many more solar storm eruptions, and it shone brighter in the ultraviolet wavelengths that also help knock atoms out of Mars' atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What this tells us is loss through space has been an important process,'' said Bruce M. Jakosky, a scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado and the principal investigator for the Maven mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer to what happened to the Martian air is key to understanding how Mars might have once been a warm, habitable planet with lakes and maybe an ocean covering the northern hemisphere. When the air disappeared, liquid water largely disappeared, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jakosky and other scientists reported their findings from Maven in four scientific papers published on Thursday in the journal Science. More than 40 additional papers by the Maven team appear in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been trying to piece together its upper atmospheric physics from a bunch of incomplete views from other spacecraft,'' said Michael W. Liemohn, a professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences at the University of Michigan who is not directly involved with Maven. ''These are great stories that they've put together from the initial data sets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Maven spacecraft, which entered orbit around Mars in September last year, carries a suite of instruments to analyze the solar wind and its effects on the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air disappears in mainly two ways. Sometimes an electron is knocked off an atom in the upper atmosphere, and then the charged atom is accelerated away by the electric and magnetic fields of the solar wind. Particles of air can also be knocked into space through collisions with incoming solar wind particles, like billiard balls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jakosky said the two phenomena are roughly equal in importance. The current papers focus on the effect on the charged atoms, usually escaping at a rate of about 100 grams, or almost a quarter of a pound, per second. During a solar storm on March 8, the rate of charged atoms flying into space was 10 to 20 times as high, as much as five pounds a second. That gave the team the first good measurements of what happens when a solar storm hits Mars. ''This is hopefully going to help us fill in many pieces of that puzzle,'' Dr. Jakosky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jasper Halekas, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Iowa and a member of the Maven team, said the energy hitting the Martian atmosphere during the storm was equivalent to a million tons of TNT an hour. ''That's one large nuclear weapon per hour, if you like,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such solar storms are not everyday events, but they are also not rare, happening perhaps a few times a year, Dr. Halekas said. He gave an analogy of a geologist studying beach erosion, wondering whether more sand is washed away by the steady, daily effects of waves and tides or by one or two big tsunami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solar storm, Dr. Halekas said, ''is the equivalent of the tsunami at Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maven's instruments also captured, to the surprise of the scientists, occasional ultraviolet auroras glowing in the Martian atmosphere -- one episode lasting several days last December and then three briefer episodes in February and March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, the planet's magnetic field channels the solar wind toward the poles, and the nighttime light shows are seen mostly at the higher latitudes and rarely near the Equator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars does not possess a global magnetic field, and scientists thought Maven might observe auroras near some ancient magnetic fields that persist in hardened lava flows. ''That's what we expected, naïvely, on Mars,'' said Nick Schneider, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado who is also on the Maven team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, during a few periods of intense solar wind, Maven spotted diffuse auroras over much of Mars. ''What we in hindsight were pretty foolish about was, what Earth's magnetic field really does is prevent auroras from happening everywhere on Earth,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''Mars, without a global magnetic field, should have auroras everywhere, certainly when solar conditions are right. We sort of did this dope slap, saying, 'Well, of course, what's going to prevent those particles from the sun from slamming into Mars' atmosphere anywhere and maybe everywhere?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another set of observations measured dust in the Martian upper atmosphere, so high and so evenly distributed that the scientists concluded the grains came from interplanetary space and not the surface or Mars' moons.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where there is water, is there life?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the $64 billion question now facing <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and the rest of lonely humanity. When the New Horizons spacecraft, cameras clicking, sped past Pluto in July, it represented an inflection point in the conquest of the solar system. Half a century after the first planetary probe sailed past Venus, all the planets and would-be planets we have known and loved, and all the marvelous rocks and snowballs circling them, have been detected and inspected, reconnoitered.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That part of human history, the astrophysical exploration of the solar system, is over. The next part, the biological exploration of space, is just beginning. We have finished counting the rocks in the neighborhood. It is time to find out if anything is living on them, a job that could easily take another half century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s mantra for finding alien life has long been to ''follow the water,'' the one ingredient essential to our own biochemistry. On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> sampled the most available water out there, as the Cassini spacecraft plunged through an icy spray erupting from the little Saturnian moon Enceladus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enceladus is only 300 miles across and whiter than a Bing Crosby Christmas, reflecting virtually all the sunlight that hits it, which should make it colder and deader than Scrooge's heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2005, shortly after starting an 11-year sojourn at Saturn, Cassini recorded jets of water squirting from cracks known as tiger stripes near the south pole of Enceladus -- evidence, scientists say, of an underground ocean kept warm and liquid by tidal flexing of the little moon as it is stretched and squeezed by Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with that, Enceladus leapfrogged to the top of astrobiologists' list of promising places to look for life. If there is life in its ocean, alien microbes could be riding those geysers out into space where a passing spacecraft could grab them. No need to drill through miles of ice or dig up rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Chris McKay, an astrobiologist at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Ames Research Center, said, it's as if nature had hung up a sign at Enceladus saying ''Free Samples.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovering life was not on the agenda when Cassini was designed and launched two decades ago. Its instruments can't capture microbes or detect life, but in a couple of dozen passes through the plumes of Enceladus, it has detected various molecules associated with life: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, molecular nitrogen, propane, acetylene, formaldehyde and traces of ammonia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's dive was the deepest Cassini will make through the plumes, only 30 miles above the icy surface. Scientists are especially interested in measuring the amount of hydrogen gas in the plume, which would tell them how much energy and heat are being generated by chemical reactions in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the moon's ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is in such ocean vents that some of the most primordial-looking life-forms have been found on our own planet. What the Cassini scientists find out could help set the stage for a return mission with a spacecraft designed to detect or even bring back samples of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are optimistic, almost sci-fi times. The fact that life was present on Earth as early as 4.1 billion years ago -- pretty much as soon as asteroids and leftover planet junk stopped bombarding the new Earth and let it cool down -- has led astrobiologists to conclude that, given the right conditions, life will take hold quickly. Not just in our solar system, but in some of the thousands of planetary systems that Kepler and other missions squinting at distant stars have uncovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if water is indeed the key, the solar system has had several chances to get lucky. Besides Enceladus, there is an ocean underneath the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa, and the Hubble Space Telescope has hinted that it too is venting into space. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has begun planning for a mission next decade to fly by it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course there's Mars, with its dead oceans and intriguing streaks of damp sand, springboard of a thousand sci-fi invasions of Earth, but in recent decades the target of robot invasions going the other direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists even make the case that genesis happened not on Earth but on Mars. Our biochemical ancestors would then have made the passage on an asteroid, making us all Martians and perhaps explaining our curious attraction to the Red Planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere and lakes on its surface, except that in this case the liquid in them is methane and the beaches and valleys are made of hydrocarbon slush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s working definition of life, coined by a group of biologists in 1992, is ''a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any liquid could serve as the medium of this thing, process, whatever it is. Life on Titan would expand our notions of what is biochemically possible out there in the rest of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our history of exploration suggests that surprise is the nature of the game. That was the lesson of the Voyager missions: Every world or moon encountered on that twin-spacecraft odyssey was different, an example of the laws of physics sculpted by time and circumstance into unique and weird forms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so far that is the lesson of the new astronomy of exoplanets -- thousands of planetary systems, but not a single one that looks like our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The detection of a single piece of pond slime, one alien microbe, on some other world would rank as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science. Why should we expect it to look anything like what we already know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That microbe won't come any cheaper than the Higgs boson, the keystone of modern particle physics, which cost more than $10 billion to hunt down over half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding that microbe will involve launching big, complicated chunks of hardware to various corners of the solar system, and that means work for engineers, scientists, accountants, welders, machinists, electricians, programmers and practitioners of other crafts yet to be invented -- astro-robot-paleontologists, say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However many billions of dollars it takes to knock on doors and find out if anybody is at home, it will all be spent here on Earth, on people and things we all say we want: innovation, education, science, technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've seen this have a happy ending before. It was the kids of the aerospace industry and the military-industrial complex, especially in California, who gave us Silicon Valley and general relativity in our pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this era, a happy ending could include the news that we are not alone, that the cosmos is more diverse, again, than we had imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another 50 years the silence from out there could be deafening.</p>

Gov. David Ige made the request in May amid protests against the building of a giant $1.4 billion telescope near the mountain's summit. He said 25 percent of the 13 telescopes already on the mountain must come down before the new Thirty Meter Telescope is ready for operation. Its construction has been stalled since April, when protesters blocked crews from the site. The nonprofit company building it has not indicated when it will resume construction, but the facility is still expected to be operational by 2024, a spokeswoman said. The university said the latest telescope marked for decommissioning would be the Ukirt Observatory, formerly known as the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email to members of the astronomy department on Wednesday, the interim chairman of the department, Gibor Basri, wrote, ''This is to inform our community that Geoff has initiated the process that will lead to his no longer being a faculty member at <span class="companylink">U.C. Berkeley</span>.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement announcing Dr. Marcy's resignation, the university's chancellor, Nicholas B. Dirks, and the executive vice chancellor and provost, Claude Steele, said they had accepted Dr. Marcy's resignation and added: ''We want to state unequivocally that Professor Marcy's conduct, as determined by the investigation, was contemptible and inexcusable. We also want to express our sympathy to the women who were victimized, and we deeply regret the pain they have suffered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university placed Dr. Marcy on probation over the summer after the investigation but did not announce the decision. It became widely known only last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of Dr. Marcy's resignation came two days after some two dozen colleagues -- an overwhelming majority of the astronomy department -- issued a vote of no confidence in a letter saying they believed that he could no longer ''perform the functions of a faculty member.'' In separate statements, the department's graduate students and postdoctoral fellows concurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This should put sexual harassers on notice: No one is too big to fail,'' Joan Schmelz, a former chairwoman of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>'s Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy and Paul Butler, now of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, became famous 20 years ago as the leading American hunters and discoverers of planets around other stars, known as exoplanets. Dr. Marcy was mentioned only a few weeks ago as a potential Nobel Prize honoree. But he also left a trail of complaints and rumors about inappropriate behavior over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, in response to a formal complaint by four former students, the University of California concluded that Dr. Marcy had violated its policies on sexual harassment. The violations, spanning 2001 to 2010, included groping students, kissing them and touching or massaging them inside their clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy was informed that another harassment violation would leave him subject to immediate suspension or dismissal -- a decision that was not widely known until <span class="companylink">BuzzFeed</span> News reported it last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the report's release, Dr. Marcy posted an apology on his website, disagreeing with some aspects of the harassment complaints but saying he took responsibility. ''It is difficult to express how painful it is for me to realize that I was a source of distress for any of my women colleagues, however unintentional,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his apology and the university's response were widely seen as not enough and lacking in sensitivity to the victims of his actions, some of whom have since left astronomy. The Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy declined his request that the apology be published in its newsletter, according to the Women in Astronomy blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 2,500 astronomers and others signed an online petition expressing support for Dr. Marcy's victims and admiration for their courage in speaking out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy stepped down from the organizing committee of a major astronomy meeting to be held in December, commemorating 20 years since the discovery of the first exoplanet by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the <span class="companylink">University of Geneva</span>, followed by the discovery of two more by Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Dr. Marcy also resigned his appointment as a principal investigator of the Breakthrough Listen project, a $100 million endeavor sponsored by the philanthropist Yuri Milner to detect radio signals from alien civilizations, according to an announcement on the project's website.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20 current and emeritus members of the faculty, which Dr. Marcy has been part of since 1999, said in a letter posted online Monday that he should go. ''We believe that Geoff Marcy cannot perform the functions of a faculty member,'' the letter said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the university administration, which placed him on probation over the summer after an investigation without announcing the decision, defended its approach, saying it left Dr. Marcy on a very tight leash and vulnerable to immediate dismissal if he violated his probation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The university has imposed real consequences on Professor Geoff Marcy by establishing a zero-tolerance policy regarding future behavior,'' said the statement, issued on Tuesday by the office of Janet Broughton, Berkeley's vice provost for the faculty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firing him, the university said, would have required a lengthy process including hearings before the faculty, ''in which outcomes are uncertain.'' Dr. Marcy, the school said, has now waived his right to those procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy has gained fame and mention as a possible Nobel Prize winner as a hunter and discoverer of planets around other stars. But he has been trailed over the years by complaints about harassment, according to people who have known him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, after a confidential investigation triggered by formal complaints by four former students, the university determined that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior, including groping students, kissing them and touching or massaging them. Two of the complainants have since left astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy was informed that another harassment violation would leave him subject to immediate suspension or dismissal -- a decision that was not common knowledge until <span class="companylink">BuzzFeed</span> News broke the story last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of its release, Dr. Marcy posted an apology on his website, disagreeing with some aspects of the harassment complaints, but saying he took responsibility. ''It is difficult to express how painful it is for me to realize that I was a source of distress for any of my women colleagues, however unintentional,'' he said, adding that he had taken steps to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many astronomers in and out of Berkeley, however, were not satisfied with the university's response, and they worried that the university was more interested in circling the wagons and protecting its star than in addressing the suffering of victims of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their fears were reinforced when an email went around to the astronomy department on Friday from the interim director of the department, Gibor Basri, that said, in part, ''Of course, this is hardest for Geoff in this moment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Basri was one of the signers of the faculty statement that criticized the secrecy of the proceedings, saying it had compromised their own efforts to maintain an open environment free from discrimination. ''We regret the harm caused by our faculty, and reject any suggestion that our sympathies should be with the perpetrators of sexual harassment,'' the letter said. Twenty-three active and retired members of the astronomy department signed the letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of graduate students in the Berkeley department issued their own statement Monday, denouncing Dr. Marcy's actions and the university's handling of the affair so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The university's failure to impose meaningful consequences on Geoff Marcy -- offering instead vague threats of future sanctions should the behavior continue -- suggests that Berkeley's administration values prestige and grant money over the well-being of the young scientists it is charged with training,'' the statement said. A link to it and another letter signed by 32 postdoctoral researchers at Berkeley was posted to the Astronomers <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page by Jeffrey Silverman, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The postdoctoral researchers urged the department to terminate its association with Dr. Marcy. ''We believe,'' they added, ''that <span class="companylink">U.C. Berkeley</span> and the astronomy department must transform their policies and practices toward sexual harassment. The first step we suggest would be public statements by the department and university that affirm the bravery and strength of the complainants and condemn Prof. Marcy's behavior.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An online petition supporting the women who spoke out and declaring that ''sexual harassment has no place in our community'' has garnered more than 2,000 signatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of Berkeley, astronomers were still reeling and trying to reconcile the new revelations with their own experiences of Dr. Marcy. The effects of this scandal on the exoplanet field, which has emerged as the most dynamic area of astronomy in the last two decades, are not clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The stakes couldn't be higher,'' said David Charbonneau, an exoplanet researcher at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>. If a top exoplanet researcher is ''a routine harasser,'' he explained, it would jeopardize gender parity in one of the fastest-growing fields in physical science.</p>

She writes on whatever is happening that's new and interesting in planetary science. She digs much deeper than most reporters. And I like the Bad Astronomy blog by Phil Plait. He debunks bad astronomy and covers other topics in the field. Also, when it comes to politics, the cartoons and articles in Funny Times seem much more informative than what I get from cable news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ERUPTING At the beginning of September we had a HiRise team meeting in Iceland, which is a good Mars analogue. Iceland has voluminous volcanism, including some very recent eruptions. Lots of things that have acted on Mars are active now in Iceland. It's a way to understand geological processes, and it's a good way to promote creative thinking about our own future projects.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDGeoffrey Marcy, an acclaimed astronomer and leader in the hunt for planets around other stars, has been found guilty of violating the sexual harassment policies of the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, where he holds the Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the university concluded that Dr. Marcy had engaged in inappropriate behavior with students, including groping them, kissing them and touching or massaging them. He was told that subsequent violations would leave him subject to sanctions, as the vice provost, Janet Broughton, said in a letter, ''that could include suspension or dismissal.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the confidential nature of such investigations, Dr. Marcy's colleagues at Berkeley, which has been shaken by discrimination lawsuits under Title IX recently, and elsewhere did not know of the investigation until this past week when Buzzfeed broke the story and Dr. Marcy posted a letter of apology on his University of California website page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While I do not agree with each complaint that was made,'' he wrote, ''it is clear that my behavior was unwelcomed by some women. I take full responsibility and hold myself completely accountable for my actions and the impact they had. For that and to the women affected, I sincerely apologize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email exchange with a reporter on Saturday, Dr. Marcy wrote, ''I have worked hard to change and will continue to focus my efforts on promoting a supportive and respectful environment both in the Astronomy community and more broadly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He took exception to one of the complaints, that he had run his hand up a woman's dress. That complaint, he said, ''is totally false.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy's wife, Susan Kegley, a pesticide researcher, said she supported him, pointing out that he had cooperated fully with the investigation and apologized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She defended her husband, writing in an email, ''Others may interpret Geoff's empathy and interest as a come-on. I can't change their perspectives, but I think it is worth all of us examining how quickly one is judged and condemned without knowing all of the facts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The punishment Geoff is receiving here in the court of hysterical public opinion is far out of proportion to what he did and has taken responsibility for in his apology,'' Dr. Kegley wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement issued Friday, the university said, ''We consider this to be a very serious matter and the university has taken strong action.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy has been told he is not welcome at a big exoplanet meeting in Hawaii in December, timed to coincide with the first discovery of planets around other stars 20 years ago, work that made Dr. Marcy famous. He has stepped down from the convention's organizing committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy has retained his job, which disappoints Sarah Ballard, who was one of the four women who brought the complaints. ''He violated the Civil Rights Act,'' said Dr. Ballard, who is now an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>. ''His job as a professor is to mentor and provide guidance to young people; in that role he's caused devastating harm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Schmelz, who was a longtime leader of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>'s committee on the status of women astronomers, said, ''I've seen sexual harassers get slaps on the wrist before. This isn't even a slap on the wrist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy's troubles come at a time when sexism and sexual harassment are gaining prominence in science. Last December, the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> cut ties with Walter Lewin, a popular lecturer, and deleted his physics course materials from its website after finding that he had sexually harassed at least one student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news has stirred the astronomical community, especially in California, which just endured a bruising battle over the fate of the University of California's venerable Lick Observatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy's behavior has been an open secret in the exoplanet community for years, John Johnson, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> and a former graduate student of Dr. Marcy, said in an interview on Saturday and in a letter that was circulated to the <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> astronomy department on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Johnson said he had refrained from speaking out while he was still a junior astronomer without tenure and vulnerable to being under Dr. Marcy's thumb -- ''something I'm not proud of.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tipping point seems to have occurred at a meeting in Washington of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span> in 2010, when several astronomers reportedly observed Dr. Marcy behaving in an overly intimate manner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2014, four of Dr. Marcy's former students filed a written complaint with Berkeley's Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the complaints was from Dr. Ballard, who was an undergraduate in one of Dr. Marcy's classes when he befriended her in 2005 after she organized a rally about sexual violence on campus. Over time, their conversations turned personal. She said Dr. Marcy described his early sexual exploits and offered advice about her boyfriend. In her complaint to university officials, Dr. Ballard also told of one episode in which she was leaving Dr. Marcy's car when he started giving her a neck massage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she was afraid to confront him because she said she knew she would need letters of recommendation for graduate school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time, Dr. Ballard said, ''I grappled with 'should I forgive?' '' Those doubts vanished when she learned other women said they had been harassed. She said she hoped speaking publicly would embolden other young women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The university has failed to protect other students from suffering what I suffered,'' Dr. Ballard said. ''Harassment is a deep problem, not just in Berkeley, but in the academy and in our culture.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes From the Last Days of American Spaceflight</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Margaret Lazarus Dean</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">317 pp. Graywolf Press. Paper, $16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like human spaceflight itself, which has yet to surpass the achievement of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Apollo missions to the moon, the literary canon of astronautics is something that peaked too soon. Forty-five years on, Norman Mailer's ''Of a Fire on the Moon'' from 1970 remains the most potent and poetic account of the first Apollo lunar landing, and Tom Wolfe's ''The Right Stuff,'' released in 1979, offers unrivaled insight into the politics and personalities behind Project Mercury, the initial ramp-up to Apollo. Wolfe and Mailer were not satisfied with mere reportage; they sought to imbue their subjects with deeper, enduring meaning, and their books became cultural touchstones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with most classic chronicles of American spaceflight, they concern events that scarcely span a single decade out of the five in which humans have ventured into space. Promising -- and delivering -- the moon is a hard act to follow. Still, something must be said for what came next, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s less glamorous, more pragmatic and far longer space shuttle program. The shuttles built the International Space Station, which has continuously hosted humans since the year 2000. They launched and serviced the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing it to peer across the cosmos, forever changing our view of the universe. In 135 flights over 30 years, the shuttles lofted more than half of all the humans (and, by weight, more than half of all the cargo) ever to reach orbit. Two of those flights, Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, ended in disasters and the deaths of all aboard. And now, just like the moon rockets that powered Apollo, the shuttles are gone -- relegated to museums after the program's end in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only when something ends can we understand what it has meant,'' Margaret Lazarus Dean writes in ''Leaving Orbit,'' her elegy to the shuttle era, the longest chapter of American spaceflight yet. By capturing ''the beauty and the strangeness'' of its end, Dean seeks to reveal the deeper meaning of the shuttle program, to do for it what Wolfe did for Project Mercury and what Mailer did for Apollo. She does not succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book's fundamental flaw is its provocative and deeply misleading premise: It is not only the shuttle era that has ended, Dean maintains, but also the entirety of American spaceflight. We have turned our backs forever on the heavens, and never again will we venture forth into outer space. Dean waffles on this here and there in the text, telegraphing that she knows how overstated her claim is, but she sticks to it just the same. It hangs like a cloud of ignorance over the book, waiting to be dissipated by the barest hint of informed sunlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The political will to keep spaceflight going just doesn't exist anymore, hasn't for a long time,'' she writes. On the contrary, what doesn't exist anymore is the political will to kill human spaceflight, even if <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is adrift in purpose: The agency's plans for future rockets presently have powerful bipartisan support in Congress, as they have had for years, though little consensus exists on programmatic goals or optimal budget levels. The post-shuttle generation of space transportation is already waiting in the wings, with <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s heavy-lift Space Launch System and crew-carrying Orion spacecraft in intensive development. Meanwhile, several private companies are building smaller, cheaper human-rated rockets of their own. Even if none of this were occurring, the truth is the nation could readily repurpose military rockets such as the Atlas V and the Delta IV to launch humans into space if desired. Dean's strong claims call for strong repudiation: No, we are not leaving orbit. No, these are not the last days of American spaceflight. Unless, that is, these are the last days of America -- which would be the topic of a different book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, there is much here to like and even love. The book is a joy to read if you can overlook the author's excessive pessimism. Dean, an associate professor of English at the <span class="companylink">University of Tennessee</span>, clearly adores <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s human space program. She has also written a novel based on the Challenger disaster, and for ''Leaving Orbit,'' she traveled to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., to witness the last three shuttle launches. She describes her experiences in superb prose that is perhaps the next best thing to being there. Astronauts freshly returned to Earth readjusting to gravity wear ''an expression of a child shaken from a happy dream,'' and shuttles are seen launching from afar in ''silent-film majesty.'' Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, makes a marvelous extended cameo. Dean even manages to squeeze in a pocket history of spaceflight that links the launches at Cape Canaveral with the 19th-century writings of Jules Verne and the 16th-century explorations of Ponce de León.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the book, however, her main focus isn't really on the scenery, or the spacecraft, or ''the unutterable awe of American heroes stabbing into the heavens on columns of fire,'' but rather on ''the people who knew the shuttles best,'' the rank-and-file workers at Kennedy whom she interviews and occasionally befriends. The small details in the stories Dean tells about these individuals as they shepherd the shuttles through their last launches and landings are often enlightening and sometimes heartbreaking, like the time she encounters a wall in the launch control center lined with plaques for each and every shuttle mission, save for the two that never came home. The wall is in a restricted area far from public access, yet the two empty spaces are still discolored from the countless reverent touches of passing <span class="companylink">NASA</span> employees. These are people, the story suggests, who love and live for spaceflight with all their hearts and souls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, despite rejecting the book's central premise, I often found myself agreeing with the deep truths Dean elegantly conveys about America's space program. Why is it that the shuttle program is ending? In part, Dean notes, it's because large numbers of Americans mistakenly believe <span class="companylink">NASA</span> consumes huge fractions of the federal budget, when in fact its allotment is about 0.4 percent. The Wall Street bailouts of 2008 consumed more funds than <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has during its entire existence. ''Uneasiness about the cost of spaceflight has always been paired with widespread positive feelings about spaceflight,'' she writes. ''Spaceflight is an achievement we take great pride in, paid for with our own money, over our objections.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttles, like the space program they were a part of, meant different things to different people. To some, human spaceflight is just geopolitical posturing, or perhaps a loss leader for advanced technology development or robotic exploration purely for science's sake. To others, it seems to be mostly very expensive and risky fireworks. To at least a few, spaceflight is a survival imperative for humankind. Dean, for her part, calls it ''a grand act of civic performance art.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One extended sequence from the book -- her visits to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Vehicle Assembly Building -- will stay with me for a long time. Designed to house multiple moon rockets and shuttles, it is one of the largest buildings by volume in the world. Dean writes of photographers trying and failing to capture the building on film, because a person standing beside it for scale becomes too small to see at the distances necessary to fit the whole structure in a frame. The building is so large the mind cannot easily grasp its dimensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its 135 flights across three decades, the space shuttle program is the same way -- too vast, sprawling, complex and multipurposed to easily contain within any human narrative. All that came before -- the razor-focused race to space and then the moon -- could not be more different, which is probably why writers like Mailer and Wolfe had any hope of transmuting it into their canonical classics. Dean's task may in fact have been impossible. The definitive saga of the space shuttle remains unwritten. Perhaps it always will be.</p>

McDonald of Queen's University in Ontario were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for discovering that the enigmatic subatomic particles known as neutrinos have mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their experiments rewrote the balance sheet of the universe. Neutrinos were once thought to be massless, but decades of study have led astronomers to conclude that their collective weight in the cosmos is about equal to the collective weight of stars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the light-carrying particles known as photons, neutrinos are the most abundant particles in the universe. Seas of them are left over from the Big Bang, and many more are produced in stars and in nuclear reactors. They drift through the earth and our own bodies like wind through a screen door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also come in three different identities, or ''flavors,'' in the jargon -- the key to their eventual unmasking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experiments by Dr. Kajita's team at the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration in Japan and Dr. <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> team at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Ontario showed that neutrinos could oscillate, changing identities like a spy on the run, as they traveled through the atmosphere or through space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That they can change identities means they have mass, according to the rules of quantum physics, and knowing that has helped cosmologists understand how the universe evolved, how the sun works and how supernova explosions occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For particle physics, this was a historic discovery,'' the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a statement. ''Its Standard Model of the innermost workings of matter had been incredibly successful, having resisted all experimental challenges for more than 20 years. However, as it requires neutrinos to be massless, the new observations had clearly showed that the Standard Model cannot be the complete theory of the fundamental constituents of the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview posted by the Nobel organization, Dr. McDonald said, ''I hugged my wife,'' after the call from the academy had awakened her, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference at the <span class="companylink">University of Tokyo</span>, Dr. Kajita said: ''I want to thank the neutrinos, of course. And since neutrinos are created by cosmic rays, I want to thank them, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kajita and Dr. McDonald will share the prize of about 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $960,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neutrinos have led physicists and astronomers on a merry chase ever since 1930, when Wolfgang Pauli suggested their existence to explain a loss of energy when neutrons decayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He later joked that he had done a terrible thing: ''I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected.'' A neutrino so rarely collides with ordinary matter that it can pass through a light-year of lead with no effect, or so the theory went.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neutrinos do hit atoms once in a great while, producing a shower of debris that can be detected. In 1956 Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected neutrinos streaming from a nuclear reactor. Experimenters later found that there were actually three kinds of neutrinos: electron, muon and tau neutrinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years later Raymond Davis, a researcher at <span class="companylink">Brookhaven National Laboratory</span>, set out to capture neutrinos from the sun in a tank of cleaning fluid set up in the <span class="companylink">Homestake Gold</span> Mine in Lead, S.D. He came up short of the predicted number, leading to speculation that something was wrong with our theories of physics or of the sun, or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an answer to the neutrino problem already existed. The Italian theorist Bruno Pontecorvo, inspired by the behavior of another subatomic particle, the kaon, suggested in 1957 that neutrinos could oscillate between different personalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this scheme of things, one form of neutrinos generated in the sun might be morphing into another, undetectable form before they got to Homestake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quest to understand these particles drove physicists deep underground, where their experiments would be shielded from cosmic rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kajita, who was born in Higashimatsuyama, Japan, in 1959, and got his Ph.D. from the <span class="companylink">University of Tokyo</span>, had cut his teeth on an experiment known as Kamiokande to see if protons, the building blocks of ordinary matter, would decay (they have not, so far).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He got interested in neutrinos because they were a source of noise in his experiment. The Super-Kamiokande, a tank of super-pure water 120 feet deep, started up in 1996 in an old zinc mine, designed to identify muon neutrinos produced by cosmic rays. Its detectors recorded flashes of light caused by debris speeding away from a neutrino hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In principle, since the Earth is transparent to neutrinos, equal numbers should have been coming from overhead and from below. But in fact more particles were coming from above, suggesting that neutrinos passing through the earth were oscillating into a form unreadable by the detector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This oscillation meant that the different flavors had different masses. ''This is clearly the physics that is beyond the Standard Model of particle physics,'' Dr. Kajita said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next bit of cosmic bookkeeping was performed by Dr. McDonald and his team at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. Dr. McDonald was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, in 1943, and earned a Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His detector, also deep underground, could distinguish electron neutrinos from the other types, either measuring the electron neutrinos or recording the overall total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> team recorded only a third of the number of electron neutrinos that theory predicted. But when the physicists measured the total number, the deficit had been made up. Two-thirds of the electron neutrinos had transformed into muon and tau neutrinos on the eight-minute journey from the sun, the collaboration reported in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had an extremely clear result that showed neutrinos do change from one type to another,'' Dr. McDonald said in an interview with the Nobel organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's prize announcement is hardly the end of the story. The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., has staked much of its future on neutrino studies -- in particular the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, or DUNE, which will beam neutrinos from Fermilab to a detector in South Dakota to study their oscillations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is fitting, Joe Lykken, deputy director of Fermilab, said in an email. ''DUNE,'' he said, ''returns us to the Homestake mine in South Dakota, where Ray Davis collected the first data on solar neutrinos back in the 1960s, inspiring the experiments being honored now with the Nobel Prize.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That conjures to mind shades-wearing Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in the ''Men in Black'' movies. Indeed, on her first day on the job, nine years ago, she was presented with a pair of sunglasses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with no extraterrestrial invasions on the horizon, Dr. Conley's job is not so much protecting Earth from aliens as protecting other planets from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars, in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're going to look for life on Mars, it would be really kind of lame to bring Earth life and find that instead,'' Dr. Conley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the news last week that scientists had identified areas of flowing water on the Martian surface -- some possibly reachable by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Curiosity rover -- that concern has taken on new urgency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands, millions, sometimes many times more, bacteria travel across the solar system on spacecraft. Earth has been invading Mars since November 1971, when the Soviet Mars 2 lander crashed. Certainly life exists on Mars today -- the microbes that have hitchhiked from Earth. Even in the harsh environs of Mars -- cold, dry, bombarded by ultraviolet light -- it takes many years for all of them to be killed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern is that some of them might not only survive but thrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the residual microbes, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Opportunity and Curiosity rovers are prohibited from visiting what are known as ''special regions'' -- places that Earth bacteria might happily call home. (InSight, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s next Mars lander, to be launched in March, and the next rover, to be launched in 2020, will also not be sterilized. In considering landing sites for the 2020 rover, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has crossed off those in special regions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinking is that some Earth microbes have been jostled to the surface of the inhospitable parts of Mars, but they would remain dormant and not proliferate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far, Mars is still pretty clean,'' Dr. Conley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas treated as special regions include the periodic dark streaks known as recurrent slope lineae -- R.S.L.s for short -- spotted on the sides of craters, canyons and mountains. Scientists last week said they were generated by the percolating of liquid water, one of the essentials for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The caution brings up a Catch-22. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> at present cannot explore the places with the greatest potential for life -- one that could come into play for Curiosity, which is slowly climbing a mountain in Gale Crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gale was selected as Curiosity's destination in part because it was the ''driest and least likely to have special regions,'' Dr. Conley said. But some candidate R.S.L.s have been unexpectedly spotted from orbit on the mountain within a couple of miles of Curiosity's planned path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James L. Green, the director of NASA's planetary science division, did not rule out that Curiosity might go to one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the streaks are confirmed as R.S.L.s, Dr. Green said, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> might then evaluate how many Earth microbes are likely to survive on the outside of Curiosity. ''That would tell us, if we can get approval from planetary protection, how close we could go,'' Dr. Green said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Conley would be the one to make that call. She said that at launch, there were probably 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant bacterial spores on Curiosity, and perhaps 100 or 1,000 times more microbes not counted. Many of them would have since perished in the vacuum of space. Intense ultraviolet radiation on the Martian surface would have killed many more -- but not all, and some drop in the soil as Curiosity trundles by and performs its science work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still having ongoing discussions,'' Dr. Conley said. ''It depends on what the results of the calculations are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not just a fastidious whim of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, but an international agreement. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 dictates that nations should take care when exploring other planets ''to avoid their harmful contamination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Committee on Space Research, part of the International Council of Science, develops planetary protection policies that Dr. Conley is responsible for carrying out. For most missions, like the Cassini orbiter at Saturn, the requirements are fairly simple -- do not crash into a body where life might exist, and when done, dispose of the spacecraft. (Cassini will be sent on a death dive into Saturn, where heat and pressure will obliterate it and any remaining microbes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar care will be taken studying Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, known to have oceans beneath the surface. But it will be many years before a lander sets down there. For now, the main concern is Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're treading new ground,'' John M. Grunsfeld, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s associate administrator for science, said of the discussions of Curiosity. ''The issue of planetary protection has gone very much from one where we're just trying to be careful to one that has very real, near-term consideration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the two Viking landers in 1976 -- <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s first and so far only attempts at detecting life on another planet -- the agency took extraordinary precautions sterilizing the spacecraft, first cleaning it to fewer than 300 heat-resistant bacterial spores per square meter. Then it was packed up and baked for several days, reducing the number of spores by a factor of 10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of the data from Viking pointed to Mars as a lifeless place. Since then, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has still cleaned its Mars spacecraft to the same standards -- ''better than a surgical suite,'' Dr. Conley said -- but skipped the baking step. Sterilization would add perhaps $100 million to the price of a mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has avoided the special regions, which include anywhere with water ice within a meter of the surface. (An exception was the Phoenix Mars lander, which dug into ice in the polar region. The arm -- but only the arm -- was sterilized to Viking standards.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The salts known as perchlorates that lower the freezing temperature of water at the R.S.L.s, keeping it liquid, can be consumed by some Earth microbes. ''The environment on Mars potentially is basically one giant dinner plate for Earth organisms,'' Dr. Conley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Earth settlers could be one of the lowliest of plants. ''I worry about lichen,'' Dr. Conley said. ''I worry about the stuff that grows on your roof. They basically eat rock and they breathe sunlight. And there's rocks and sunlight on Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Conley inadvertently entered the planetary protection field because of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia, which was carrying an experiment of hers involving nematode worms when it disintegrated during re-entry in 2003. The experiment was recovered amid the wreckage, and the worms were still alive. ''Multicellular animals, at least small ones, can survive uncontrolled atmospheric entry, so long as they don't get too hot,'' Dr. Conley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insides of meteorites similarly stay cool when they streak through the atmosphere, and the findings support the idea that life could have traveled back and forth between Earth and Mars in rocks knocked to space by meteor impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some <span class="companylink">NASA</span> critics, the concerns of planetary protection are just an expensive ball and chain that slow study of the solar system. Why the extreme caution now if one day in a few decades, astronauts, carrying a slew of Earth microbes, arrive to colonize Mars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a changing picture of present-day Mars that is not quite as desolate as once thought, ''we actually do need to be careful,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said, adding, ''We do need to watch what we're doing, because there could be life on Mars.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space western and a blissed-out cosmic high, ''The Martian'' stars Matt Damon as an American astronaut who, like a latter-day Robinson Crusoe, learns to survive on his own island of despair. At once epic and intimate, it involves a dual journey into outer and inner space, a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway, space is the place where he's physically marooned, but also where his mind is set free -- a dynamic that of course invokes moviegoing itself.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps that's one reason Ridley Scott keeps returning to deep space. This is the third of his films -- after ''Alien'' in 1979 and ''Prometheus'' in 2012 -- set beyond the dark side of the moon. Hands down it's also the funniest, loosest and most optimistic of the group, at once an ode to far-out adventuring and to terra-firma home, a sweeping, old-fashioned entertainment and a plaintive portrait of solitude as both a creative necessity and a danger. It also serves as a nice plug for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, which has returned the favor by pushing the movie on its website. (On Monday, scientists announced that signs of liquid water could be seen in photographs taken on Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, timing that suggests <span class="companylink">NASA</span> certainly has the whole cross-promotion thing down.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the novel ''The Martian'' by Andy Weir that Drew Goddard has turned into a fast-moving, streamlined script, the movie focuses on Mark Watney (Mr. Damon), who, during a windstorm on Mars, is accidentally left behind by his team. Mr. Scott likes the action to hit hard and fast: One minute Watney is joking with his space buddies -- Jessica Chastain leads a crew that includes Kate Mara and Michael Peña -- and minutes later he's been hooked like a fish by some flying metal that knocks him out. Believing him dead, the crew takes off, as does the movie, which soon becomes a tale of two planets with initially competing narratives, one involving Watney's efforts simply to stay alive and the second centered on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s postdisaster strategizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After some self-surgery to deal with the rod spearing his gut, along with some anxious stock-taking -- he has plenty of tunes but not enough air, water and food to survive for long -- Watney gets down to the business of living, including farming. ''I'm not going to die here,'' he helpfully mutters, helpfully because he talks out loud a lot whether just murmuring to himself or recording a video entry in his growing space log. The log keeps the words flowing in what could have been a fairly quiet movie, creating an animated lively babble that approaches the chummy feel of a video face chat. Watney makes for affably pleasant if worrisome company, and if there isn't much mystery to him it's because the purity of his struggle doesn't leave him, at least, time for deep dives into questions of existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Watney is isolated at first, with no means of communicating with Earth, the parallel narrative means that he's never truly alone, unlike, say, Crusoe (before Friday) or Tom Hanks's character in ''Cast Away'' (before Wilson), whose profound isolation is critical to how you experience them and their stories. Like these other marooned souls (including the 1964 ''Robinson Crusoe on Mars''), Watney is physically and psychologically apart, but even before he pings Earth with his big news, you know people are mourning him. The Earth scenes interrupt these solitary interludes with other faces and voices, keeping the narrative jumping, but they also assert that no matter how lost and seemingly forgotten, no one is alone because to be human fundamentally is to exist with other people. We are social, therefore we are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gradually, the two stories become one as Watney and everyone else gets to work. At <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, various brainiacs take hammers and tongs to physics at both the Johnson Space Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where supernerds take on the logistics of a rescue mission. The movie gently thumps several issues: It's unambiguously on the side of science and rationalism with glints of manifest destiny, American can-do-ism and a little flag-waving folded in. It is also about willing yourself out of the lonely room -- call it Mars or your head -- and into the world, however inhospitable, so you can breathe the air and drink the water (Watney learns to make both) and yearn for others. It's a moving testament from the 77-year-old Mr. Scott, whose art comes in all shades of dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, by contrast, he seems almost giddily attuned to the buzz of human endeavor. The <span class="companylink">NASA</span> scenes with their friendly, familiar faces -- Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels -- unfold with charming predictability with corrugated brows, hushed and raised voices, acres of glowing screens and warehouses of space stuff. The vibe is of serious, smart people doing serious, smart work for the good of the rest of us. Mr. Ejiofor's enormous, pleading eyes signal how grave the situation is, while Ms. Wiig's prickly warmth and Mr. Daniels's Daffy Duck mouth-flapping keep the whole thing from getting too heavy. Mr. Scott is a brilliant assembler of casts, and he knows how to organize groups so they seem to naturally fit, and can bob and weave in unison with his roving cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike some advertising directors who transitioned to filmmaking, he has always been a good director of actors, though it's instructive that he uses performers who are either forceful enough screen presences or strikingly beautiful enough (usually both) to stand up to his lush visual style, who can meet the challenge of his meaningfully complex sets and natural vistas. When the film works, the bold drama of his visuals and the dramatic boldness of his stories flow together, becoming all of a narrative piece. Some of these pieces resonate with other meanings, like the red-rock buttes in ''Thelma &amp; Louise'' and the similarly rust-colored formations in ''The Martian'' that are suggestive of John Ford's Monument Valley films. Sometimes here, Mr. Scott seems to be returning to his own work, which may be why you can see Susan Sarandon (Louise), with her protuberant gaze and thin-skinned tremulousness, in Mr. Ejiofor. And of course Mr. Scott loves tough women, so it's no surprise that Ms. Chastain and Ms. Mara are on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Martian'' has sweep but not the vanity that creeps into many large productions, turning them into bloated vehicles for directorial self-aggrandizement. Mr. Damon's Everyman quality (he's our Jimmy Stewart) helps scale the story down, but what makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott's filmmaking, in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face. There's a touch of Cecil B. DeMille in his cinematic DNA (for better and occasionally for worse), though, like many who saw ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' during their esthetically formative years, there's even more Stanley Kubrick. But Mr. Scott is very much his own artist, one whose reputation as a visual stylist has at times obscured that his great, persistent theme is what it means to be human.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Martian'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Life, death and science.</p>

Which raises an interesting conundrum: How best to explore the damp areas on Mars without contaminating them with microbes carried there from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> said on Monday that instruments aboard a spacecraft orbiting Mars had detected signs of hydrated salts at four locations. The salts almost certainly have been hydrated by liquid water in recent days. The water was not standing in pools, but was more like streaks of wet soil. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials described the streaks as evidence that ''water -- albeit briny -- is flowing today on the surface of Mars.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since liquid water is essential to life on Earth, the findings raised hopes that microscopic life might be found in the four locations or others like them scattered over Mars. The problem is that <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s two active rovers currently on Mars are not thoroughly sterilized and the next rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, will not be sterile, either. There is a danger that they might harbor microbes from Earth that could spread to the Martian surface and confuse further efforts to distinguish Martian life-forms from those of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space-faring nations of the world have long followed strict treaty-required procedures to protect planets, moons, comets and asteroids from contamination by Earth life. On Mars ''special regions'' have been designated as needing protection because terrestrial organisms are likely to propagate there or Martian life-forms may exist. It may not be easy to keep those areas pristine given how little is known about how life propagates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review conducted by European and American experts recently concluded that scientists lack detailed knowledge of the physical and chemical conditions on the surface of Mars and know too little about the ability of terrestrial life to reproduce on other worlds. Will it require one cell from a single species or a million cells for that life-form to take root on Mars?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apocalypse is still on, apparently -- at least in a galaxy about 3.5 billion light-years from here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last winter, a team of Caltech astronomers reported that two supermassive black holes appeared to be spiraling together toward a cataclysmic collision that could bring down the curtains in that galaxy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence was a rhythmic flickering from the galaxy's nucleus, a quasar known as PG 1302-102, which Matthew Graham and his colleagues interpreted as the fatal mating dance of a pair of black holes with a total mass of more than a billion suns. Their merger, the astronomers calculated, could release as much energy as 100 million supernova explosions, mostly in the form of violent ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves that would blow the stars out of that hapless galaxy like leaves off a roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a new analysis of the system by Daniel D'Orazio of <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> and his colleagues has added weight to that conclusion. Mr. D'Orazio, a graduate student, and his colleagues Zoltan Haiman and David Schiminovich propose that most of the light from the quasar is coming from a vast disk of gas surrounding the smaller of the two black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the black holes and their attendant disks swing around each other at high speeds, the light from the disk that is coming toward us receives a boost from relativistic effects -- a so-called Doppler boost -- the way a siren grows louder and more high-pitched as it approaches, giving rise to a periodic increase in brightness every five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia astronomers' model predicts that the variation would be two or three times greater in ultraviolet light than in visible light. And that is exactly what they found when they compared archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Galex space telescope to the visible-light data previously analyzed by Dr. Graham's group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's big is that the Doppler boost is inevitable,'' Dr. Haiman said in an email. Given reasonable assumptions about the masses of the two black holes, their model predicts the right ultraviolet data. ''This is rare in 'messy' astronomy,'' he said, ''to have an indisputable clean effect, which explains the data.'' Follow-up observations of ultraviolet and visible light emissions in the coming years could help clinch the case, the authors said. Their paper was published last week in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their model suggests that the black holes are orbiting each other at a distance of some 200 billion miles, less than a tenth of a light-year, a cosmic whisker. At that distance, the black holes would be rapidly losing energy by radiating gravitational waves and could spiral together into the final bang in as little as 100,000 years, Dr. Haiman said, depending on their relative masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically, the more massive the holes, the faster gravitational waves drive them together, and we do require them to be as massive as allowed to be,'' he said in an email. For their model to hold up, the larger of the black holes has to be a billion solar masses or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Because the galaxy is so far away, the cataclysm might well have already happened more than three billion years ago, but the news still won't reach us for another 100,000 years or so. So it is still in the future, as far as earthlings -- whoever they will be by then -- are concerned.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E. Sterl Phinney, a Caltech astronomer and expert on supermassive black holes, agreed that Dr. Haiman's model explained the quasar variations. ''So Occam's razor makes it attractive,'' he said in an email, referring to the long-held principle that physicists should adopt the simplest theory that fits the facts. But it was surprising, he said, to find two supermassive black holes that have gotten so close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes, predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, are objects so dense that not even light can escape from them. Every galaxy of note seems to have a supermassive black hole, weighing millions or billions of times as much as the sun, burping sparks of half-eaten stars and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When galaxies merge, their resident black holes are sent into forced marriages, orbiting each other. But without gravitational interactions with stars or interstellar gas, supermassive black holes can't get close enough to each other to go into a rapid death spiral, a situation known as the ''final parsec'' problem. (A parsec is the astronomical standard of distance, 3.26 light-years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, as Dr. Phinney explained, unless hundreds of millions of solar masses of gas accompany the black holes, ''there are not very convincing ways of getting them to smaller separations'' like the black holes in PG 1302-102.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least that is the theory. If such systems are common, Dr. Phinney said, the gravitational waves emanating from them should sweep the universe and disrupt the timing of signals from pulsars, an effect that could be detected within the next few years by various continuing programs to time pulsars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A scientific theory is only as good as the tests which it has passed,'' Mr. D'Orazio said in an email. Although general relativity has passed all of the observational and experimental tests thrown at it so far, some of its predictions can be tested only in the most extreme gravitational environments, namely black holes. ''Detection of gravitational waves,'' he said, ''is a direct probe of this region and hence the secrets of gravity.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest effort to revive Florida's Space Coast, which was economically battered after <span class="companylink">NASA</span> stopped flying the space shuttles in 2011. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, and the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture between <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, already use nearby launching pads at Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, Blue Origin, based in Kent, Wash., south of Seattle, has sometimes waited days or months to mention successes or failures, with Mr. Bezos providing brief updates on Blue Origin's website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even after Tuesday's public ceremony, exactly what Blue Origin plans to launch from Cape Canaveral remains somewhat mysterious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket, still unnamed, will be large enough to reach orbit, and it will debut later this decade, Mr. Bezos said. But he did not give specifics about which markets he is aiming for with his business model. ''We're building a vehicle for humans,'' Mr. Bezos said in an interview. ''That's my personal passion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such a rocket ''can clearly lift payloads of all kinds,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stage of the rocket is intended to be fully reusable -- landing vertically back on Earth -- unlike most rockets today, which crash back to Earth after one flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach is similar to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s attempts to land the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating platform, a first step to refurbishing it and flying it again. Blue Origin had patented the barge landing idea, but <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> successfully challenged the patent, and Blue Origin has since given up on the claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin lost another skirmish with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> last year in the bidding to take over one of two launchpads at the Kennedy Space Center that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had used for the space shuttles. After that setback, Blue Origin looked at options in five states before deciding on Launch Complex 36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Blue Origin completed the first test flight of its New Shepard spacecraft, accelerating past three times the speed of sound to reach an altitude of 307,000 feet above a testing site in West Texas. The capsule, without any passengers, separated and parachuted gently to the ground. The booster, designed to land back on the ground, crashed because of a malfunction in the hydraulic system. New Shepard, which is to take tourists on suborbital jaunts, will continue to launch from Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of his public remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Bezos looked to the future. ''I don't know how long this will take,'' Mr. Bezos said, ''but one day I look forward to having a press conference with you guys in space.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The world will clearly see a series of satellites of military-first Korea soaring into the sky,'' the official news agency quoted the head of the country's National Aerospace Development Administration as saying.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials and analysts in the region have speculated that the North will launch a long-range rocket with a satellite on board around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party. The country's leader, Kim Jong-un, has been seeking to build his prestige with advances in rocketry and missiles, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea has said its space program is peaceful, and the aerospace official quoted by the state news agency, Korean Central News Agency, said the satellite would gather data for weather forecasting. But after the country put a small satellite into orbit in December 2012, the United States and its allies worried that in the process, the North was learning how to build long-range ballistic missiles that could strike targets as far as the West Coast of the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it is known to have a few nuclear weapons, North Korea has never tested a missile that could deliver one beyond its home region. Some analysts have doubted whether the North has the ability to build a warhead that could survive re-entry from space or one small enough to mount on a long-range missile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American and South Korean intelligence officials monitor the North's main launch site at Tongchang-ri in northwestern North Korea for signs of activity. The North has worked on the site for years to prepare it for rockets bigger than the three-stage Unha-3 booster that was used in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South Korean defense minister, Han Min-koo, told Parliament last week that there were no signs that a launch at Tongchang-ri was imminent. But the South's foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, said South Korea did not rule out the possibility of one to celebrate the party's anniversary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and the <span class="companylink">United Nations Security Council</span> has adopted a series of resolutions and sanctions against it since then, including a ban on rocket launches using ballistic missile technology. After the 2012 satellite launch, the Security Council added new sanctions, prompting the North to threaten to conduct another nuclear test, a threat it carried out in February 2013, drawing yet another round of sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, has called for his country to develop and launch ''a variety of more working satellites'' using ''carrier rockets of bigger capacity.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE United States asks <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to do an extraordinary amount with very little money. Explore Mars, document climate change, stop doomsday asteroids, find life on Europa -- all for less than one-half of 1 percent of the federal budget. But budget uncertainties on Capitol Hill, including delays in federal appropriations legislation and temporary government shutdowns, measurably harm the American space program. Even the threat of a shutdown can have a far-reaching impact on scientific projects, often in unexpected ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I keep a standing <span class="companylink">Google</span> News alert for '<span class="companylink">NASA</span> Budget,' 'Federal Budget' and 'Government Shutdown,' '' says Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Osiris-REx mission, in which a spacecraft will fly to an asteroid, study it, grab a piece of it, and then fly back to Earth. Osiris-REx is set to launch next year, but the federal shutdown in 2013 caused a major schedule slip in the development of a key instrument on the spacecraft, costing taxpayers $1.7 million.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Eric Smith, the program director of the James Webb Space Telescope, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> programs develop contingency plans for how hardware can be placed into a safe configuration should, for example, the order for a shutdown be given. It was a hard-learned lesson. ''In 2013,'' he said, ''some of our science instruments, including ones from our foreign partners, were in a cryogenic vacuum when the shutdown order came. We were permitted to keep the hardware safe in a cold vacuum state, but could not continue testing.'' As a result, the program was able to make up for it, but at a cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such delays are not trivial events at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>; everything there is tested, first in isolation and then in aggregate, each part having to prove itself to engineering specifications before being added to a larger rocket or spacecraft, where more tests are conducted to make sure everything works well together. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> flourishes when it is given a clear goal and the long term support to make it happen. Erratic funding streams add an unstable element to a process where instability means the loss of irreplaceable hardware and the interruption of research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (Maven) spacecraft, a $671 million mission to study the composition of the Martian upper atmosphere, sat at Kennedy Space Center ready to go to space, but with no one there to push the button. Congress and the Obama administration were competing to see who would blink first, but the planets weren't waiting. If Maven didn't lift off before the close of its launch window, the position of Mars relative to Earth would force a launch delay of 26 months. This would have had repercussions for Mars missions subsequent to Maven, as well as for scientists awaiting data for study and analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch was saved at the last minute only because of a technicality. The Antideficiency Act, a century-old law that prohibits the federal government from spending money before appropriation (or in excess of it), is the reason that the government shuts down when Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill. Its language is unambiguous, though it does provide an exception for ''emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maven, though ostensibly designed to study the atmosphere of Mars, also contains a powerful telecommunications relay. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> asserted that the active Mars rovers, Curiosity and Opportunity, would be endangered without Maven to augment the aging communications systems on satellites already orbiting Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. To avoid another shutdown this year, Congress will most likely pass continuing resolutions to keep things running while differences are hashed out. Although such stopgap measures authorize spending at current levels, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s funding is capped at whichever budget is lower -- the current one, or the president's proposed budget. Congress has been good to <span class="companylink">NASA</span> in recent years, at least with respect to planetary exploration, ultimately restoring most of the funding cuts proposed annually by the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even a continuing resolution will be a problem for the planetary science division, which is responsible for Osiris-REx, the rovers on Mars and the New Horizons spacecraft, which is still sending back data from its mission to Pluto. Based on the proposed budget, funding for the division will immediately drop by approximately $76 million until an actual budget is passed. Something will have to be shut down or postponed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an annual report last year, Paul K. Martin, the inspector general of NASA, reported that ''fiscal uncertainties'' compounded the problem of the agency's meeting its already underfunded goals, and ''the principal challenge facing <span class="companylink">NASA</span> leaders in 2015 will be to effectively manage the agency's varied programs in an uncertain budget environment.'' The 2013 annual report said the same thing. So did the 2012 report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the agency is forced to hobble into 2016 on a continuing resolution, haunted by continued budget uncertainties, it's easy to guess what the inspector general's next report will say. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> deserves better than this. We all do.</p>
