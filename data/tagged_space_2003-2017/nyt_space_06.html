<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched more than 35 years ago and now 11.5 billion miles from where it started, is closing in on this boundary. In recent years scientists have been waiting eagerly for it to become the first artificial object to leave the solar system and enter the wider reaches of the Milky Way, which they fully expect it to do. But there has been at least one false alarm.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, scientists reported that, no, Voyager 1 still had not reached interstellar space, but it had entered a region that no one expected and no one can yet explain, a curious zone that is almost certainly the last layer of our Sun's empire -- technically speaking, the heliosphere. Three papers published in the journal Science describe in detail the sudden and unpredicted changes encountered in the surroundings of Voyager 1, which left Earth about three months after the original ''Star Wars'' movie was released and is heading for the cosmos at 38,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists had expected that Voyager 1 would detect two telltale signs as it passed through the heliosheath, the outermost neighborhood of the solar system, which is thought to abut the heliopause, as the actual boundary is known. Happily, the key instruments on Voyager 1, as well as those on its twin, Voyager 2, are still working after all these years, and its nuclear power source will last until at least 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, one of the two events occurred, but not the other, leaving scientists perplexed. Scientists had predicted that at the boundary between solar system and interstellar space, the solar wind -- a stream of charged particles blown out by the Sun -- would fade away, and that Voyager 1 would no longer detect it. That happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also expected that the direction of the magnetic field would change as Voyager 1 emerged from the Sun's magnetic bubble. That did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nature is far more imaginative than we are,'' said Stamatios M. Krimigis, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory who is the principal investigator of an instrument that records charged particles hitting Voyager 1. Dr. Krimigis is an author of one of the papers in Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, the spacecraft -- which is roughly 1,600 pounds and would fit inside a cube about 13 feet on each side, according to NASA -- observed a momentary dip in the intensity of the solar wind. ''It was exciting,'' said Edward C. Stone, the project scientist for the two Voyagers. ''We had never seen such a drop before. It happened in less than a day. Then five days later, it was back up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-August, there was a deeper momentary dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Aug. 25, the solar wind dropped by a factor of more than a thousand, vanishing to imperceptible levels, and it has remained at essentially zero since. At the same time, the number of cosmic rays from outside the solar system jumped by 9.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked like we were outside,'' Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the magnetic field has steadily, stubbornly pointed in the same direction, indicating that Voyager 1 is still ensconced within the Sun's magnetic field. Scientists guess that in this region the magnetic fields of the solar system partly connect to those of the surrounding interstellar space, allowing the solar particles to escape. (Charged particles travel along magnetic field lines.) They have named the zone through which Voyager 1 is hurtling the heliosheath depletion region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's clear we do not have a model which explains all of this,'' Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2, which is moving slightly more slowly and is not as far from the Sun, has not yet encountered this region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stone noted that when the two Voyagers launched in 1977 on a grand tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the space age was just 20 years old, and there was no way to know that NASA had built something that would last 35 years, long after it passed the planets. But the designers of the mission were prescient to be prepared if they lasted that long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It turns out that in fact we designed the cosmic ray instrument specifically for this phase of this mission,'' Dr. Stone said. ''We were planning, and it really paid off. We've begun to see what's outside even though the magnetic field says you're not outside.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for actually reaching the outside of the solar system, Dr. Stone said, ''it could be a few months, or it could be several more years.''</p>

China is seeking to master the skills and technology needed to operate a manned space lab for long stretches, and the crew on the latest flight practiced rendezvous and docking exercises with the orbiting Tiangong 1 space module, a small prototype of such a lab.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan -- On a sultry desert evening, as bats fluttered about this town's riverfront park, a man emerged from a reedy marsh carrying a bundle of grass tied with twine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting it down to brush himself off, he explained that he was keeping a calf in the courtyard of an apartment building across town, where he had settled in recently after the previous occupants, engineers with the Russian space program, moved out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baikonur, in remote western Kazakhstan, was once the pride of the Soviet Union, the home of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the launching site of Sputnik, the dog Laika and the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin. But today, nomadic herders from the nearby steppe are moving into abandoned buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is just one of the signs of the city's long fade into the sunset of post-Soviet social and economic problems, which are all the more remarkable given that much of the world, including the United States, still relies on Baikonur for manned space launchings. The only other site for such liftoffs is in Jiuquan, in the Gobi Desert in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's painful for me to think of my town,'' Anna Khodakovskaya, the editor of the local newspaper, said of its glum state. The first cellphones appeared here in 2004; the first M.R.I. machine in 2011. ''We are not ahead of the planet in anything but space,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today 70 percent of Baikonur's residents are Kazakh citizens, but the town remains a Russian enclave rented from the Kazakh government and administered under Russian jurisdiction. At the time of the Soviet breakup, the ratios were reversed: it was only about one-third Kazakh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the squatting herders, day laborers and market traders stroll the streets, with only the occasional aging Russian engineer visible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a dusty town, where many sidewalks are sandy tracks but nearly every building is decorated with a mosaic of a rocket, a spacewalking cosmonaut or stars and fanciful renderings of planets. In fountains, water bubbles from spouts shaped like rockets, and signed portraits of astronauts adorn the walls of cafes, where coffee is served in the Turkish style with grounds in the cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a loose end from the breakup of the Soviet Union that has, strangely, become extraordinarily important for every manned space program except China's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA last month extended the contract for astronaut launchings for a year, until mid-2017, for an additional $424 million. For now, every American astronaut blasts off from this town, the stand-in for Cape Canaveral during a gap in funding for manned missions in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of this dependency, NASA now requires all its astronauts in training to achieve proficiency in Russian before graduating to the astronaut corps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agencies of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, Japan and Canada also launch from here on Russian rockets, under an agreement with NASA to repurchase about half of the six seats NASA buys annually from the Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From all this, Baikonur may sound like a prosperous hub of space activity. But the state of affairs is only temporary -- every nation including Russia, which is building a replacement launchpad on its own territory in the Far East, called Vostochny, views this state of affairs as temporary. As a result, the city of Baikonur has been ignored, and it is falling apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Russia will not be able to roll up the roads and take them away when it leaves,'' Ms. Khodakovskaya said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social problems typical of Central Asia today, like abuse of heroin smuggled from Afghanistan, labor migration and growing Islamic fundamentalism, are creeping into the city. A few years back, the police arrested men in Tura-Tam, a Kazakh village just outside Baikonur's guarded fence, for distributing leaflets for Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a fundamentalist Islamic group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is a low boil of ethnic tension, too, as Russians hold nearly all the high-paying space jobs. In 2011, young Kazakh men ran in a mass down a central street yelling, ''The head is a dog,'' a reference to the Russian mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the outdoor market, behind heaps of apricots and tomatoes, traders flash gold-toothed smiles and hawk Central Asian pottery glazed with crudely drawn rockets, or the smiling face of Yuri Gagarin in a helmet. Flies sampled the savory pies of mutton and pumpkin on display.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before space missions, NASA astronauts and administrators stay at an upscale hotel on the edge of town, where the cheapest room is about $340 a night, rarely venturing into the town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's interlude here is surreal, to be sure, though the United States has had gaps in its ability to reach space before: from the end of the Apollo program in 1975 until the first shuttle mission in 1981, and after both shuttle disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have always been treated with tremendous hospitality under difficult logistical circumstances,'' Rob Navias, a NASA spokesman, said in an interview here before the launching of an American astronaut, Karen L. Nyberg, last month. ''We are in a transition period right now, and we are hoping the transition is a short one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American astronauts ride a bus to the Russian rockets over a rutted, bumpy road where camels graze on the shoulders; nobody bothers to fill the potholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even President Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech on Cosmonaut Day on April 12, referred to Baikonur as ''physically aged.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people are putting up rockets, but the town itself is like a third-world country,'' said Jene Ragan, a software engineer from Bethesda, Md., who came as a tourist to watch a liftoff in May, swatting at flying ants out on the steppe while watching the rollout of a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alarmed at the state of Baikonur, the head of Kazakhstan's space agency, Talgat Musabayev, in December suggested canceling the rental agreement with Russia; Kazakhstan charges Russia $115 million a year for the town. ''The agreement has run its course,'' Mr. Musabayev said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kazakhs bristle at Russia's efforts to keep Kazakh squatters out of abandoned buildings, which are formally Kazakh property, noting the housing shortage in the region. They complain of debris falling on their territory from jettisoned rocket stages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, the Russians threatened to simply pull out entirely in 2018 when Vostochny is ready for manned launchings, Izvestia reported.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the four women in NASA's latest class of astronaut trainees, which also includes four men. The eight recruits -- the first NASA has named in four years, and the first group to include equal numbers of men and women -- were selected from 6,300 applicants and will start training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston in August, the space agency said Monday.</p>

McClain, 34, the helicopter pilot, who is from Spokane, Wash., and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point. ''I truly don't remember ever wanting to be something else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and the other recruits spoke in prerecorded video introductions that NASA shared as part of an online video conference. The agency did not make the trainees available for interviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said that the new class, the agency's 21st, was the smallest group to date, chosen after a year-and-a-half search from the largest applicant pool since 1978. Only 120 applicants were invited to come to the Johnson Space Center, where they underwent initial medical evaluations and an hour interview with the selection board. Forty-nine candidates were invited back for a second round of interviews as well as language aptitude tests, psychological evaluations and mechanical skills assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the eight who were finally selected, five come from branches of the military and many of them hold multiple advanced degrees in physics, engineering, biology and medicine. Those who make it through two years of intense training will join NASA's existing corps of 49 astronauts, down from a peak of 149 in 2000. And the newcomers may then have to wait up to 10 years before their first spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a smaller astronaut corps, fewer people in the office now, each person needs to have as diverse a background as possible,'' Janet Kavandi, director of flight crew operations at Johnson Space Center, said during the online video hosted on Google+ Hangout. ''So we tried to work hard to make sure that the eight people we got had a broad spectrum of experiences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new class also has the highest percentage of female candidates, which NASA said was not intentional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's actually just a reflection of how many really talented women are in science and engineering these days,'' said Kathleen Rubins, a NASA astronaut from the class of 2009, in a telephone interview. ''They're folks that have technical expertise in their chosen field, but they also bring a whole lot to the table'' in their determination and ability to thrive under pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of astronauts has dwindled along with the number of human space missions. NASA retired its space shuttle program two years ago, and has been booking space for American astronauts on Russian Soyuz capsules since then. But commercial spaceflight companies are now preparing to resume piloted American rocket launchings, ideally in 2017, according to the goal date by NASA, which has supported the private efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight new astronaut candidates will compete to be among ''the first to launch from U.S. soil on commercial American spacecraft since the retirement of the space shuttle,'' NASA said in its announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Ms. McClain, the women of the class of 2013 include Christina M.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Segue 2, the dwarf galaxy consists of just 1,000 stars held together by a clump of dark matter. (By comparison, the Milky Way contains at least 100 billion stars.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Finding a galaxy this small is like finding an elephant smaller than a mouse,'' said James Bullock, a cosmologist at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of a paper on Segue 2 published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Segue 2, first discovered in 2009 as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, is important for reasons other than size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For about 15 years, we have been predicting that galaxies like the Milky Way should be surrounded by thousands and thousands of low-mass clumps of dark matter'' like the one at the center of Segue 2, Dr. Bullock said. Until now, even the smallest ''clumps'' detected by scientists were high mass -- at least a million times the mass of the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At no more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun, Segue 2 ''could be the first of these clumps detected that we've been predicting should be out there,'' Dr. Bullock said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, failure to find such clumps had puzzled astronomers. ''It suggested there was some flaw in our theory of how the universe works,'' said Dr. Bullock, who was part of a team that used the powerful telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this discovery, he said, there is hope that ''this might be just be the tip of the iceberg.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMES, Iowa -- As the car pulled into the parking lot of a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, William Sanford Nye unknotted his trademark bow tie and slipped it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This might buy us a couple of minutes,'' he said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly two minutes later, before his drink was ready, he was recognized anyway. Two awed young women approached to ask if he was really Bill Nye the Science Guy. Like more than a dozen other college students who would approach him over the next several hours, they asked if they could take a picture with him. He smiled, took a proffered iPhone, scooched the students in and, in a practiced gesture, stretched out his arm to take a shot of the three of them that you just knew was totally going on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye had come to talk to them, and a few thousand of their friends, at <span class="companylink">Iowa State University</span>. If he were a politician, college students would be his base. Instead, he is something more: a figure from their early days in front of the family TV, a beloved teacher and, more and more these days, a warrior for science. They, in turn, are his fans, his students and his army.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have gone from watching him explain magnetism and electricity to defending the scientific evidence for climate change, the age of the earth and other issues they have seen polemicized for religious, political and even economic reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He takes on those who would demand that the public schools teach alternative theories of evolution and the origins of the earth -- most famously, in a video clip from the site BigThink.com that has been viewed some five million times. In it, he flatly tells adult viewers that ''if you want to deny evolution and live in your world -- in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe -- that's fine. But don't make your kids do it, because we need them. We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any given week, you're likely to see Mr. Nye, 57, somewhere on television, calmly countering the arguments made by people like Marc Morano, the former Republican Senate staff member whose industry-funded organization, climatedepot.com, disputes the increasingly well-understood connection between rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and warming. In an exchange several months ago on ''Piers Morgan Tonight'' on CNN, Mr. Morano denied that warming is occurring, and scoffed that Mr. Nye's arguments were ''the level of your daily horoscope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye quietly rebutted his opponent with the gravity of scientific consensus. ''This will be the hottest two decades in recorded history,'' he said. ''I've got to disagree with you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes his advocacy can step out in front of scientific consensus, however. In May, after a monster tornado devastated large parts of Moore, Okla., he took a jab on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> at one of that state's United States senators, James Inhofe, who has written a book calling climate change ''the greatest hoax.'' He mused: ''Has anyone asked Oklahoma Senator Inhofe'' about the frequency of such destructive storms? Yet a link between climate change and tornado activity has not been established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the night the tornado hit Moore, Mr. Nye explained to Mr. Morgan that ''you can't say from any one storm that 'this is a result of, let's say, climate change.' '' But he noted that ''if there's more heat driving the storm, then there's going to be more tornadoes,'' and added that the question ''is worth investigating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, said that he considered Mr. Nye ''among my best friends'' and complimented him for ''hitting controversial topics head on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said, his own style is a bit less confrontational: ''I'm looking to stimulate curiosity so most people can go out there and learn on their own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Plait, the creator of the Bad Astronomy blog at Slate.com and a fierce advocate himself, is more like Mr. Nye, willing to take the gloves off in rebutting those who might deny that men landed on the moon, or the evidence for human effects on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Plait said admiringly of Mr. Nye, ''He will very calmly tear them apart,'' adding, ''His big advantage is, he's right. We know that climate change is real. We know creationism is wrong. These are no longer scientific controversies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people call these 'controversial topics,' that's misleading,'' he continued. ''They are only controversial politically. And politics is not necessarily evidence-based.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was nothing in Mr. Nye's early days that suggested he might be a firebrand for science. Born in Washington, D.C., he studied mechanical engineering at Cornell, where he got to know a professor named Carl Sagan. He moved out West to do engineering for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, where he spent some three years designing a hydraulic tube for the 747 that served to dampen vibration in the steering mechanism. He refers to it lovingly as ''my tube.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He tried his hand at stand-up comedy -- his first time onstage was during a Steve Martin look-alike competition, which he won. He would achieve escape velocity from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> with an idea for a television program that would teach science to children in a wacky way. The best-known version of ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' ran from 1992 to 1996, and won 18 Emmys in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye's past teaching and present crusading have made him a rock star for scientifically inclined students across the country. That celebrity has allowed him, as executive director of the Planetary Society, to push for the kind of interplanetary exploration that, he said in an interview, ''leads to the reverence that we have for our place in the cosmos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Space,'' he added, ''brings out the best in us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of Mr. Nye's visit to the Iowa State campus, students began lining up by midafternoon to make sure they got into the evening lecture. Stephens Auditorium holds about 3,000 people, and as many as a thousand would ultimately be turned away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They came, many said, because ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' helped shape their lives. ''He was probably the one who inspired me to keep going in the science career track,'' said Betsy Salmon, the first person in line at one entrance to the auditorium. She majored in animal ecology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaci McCleary, an ''aspiring neurobiologist, or neuro-something,'' said that Mr. Nye was ''a very inspiring person in the field of science -- he tells people to make science part of their lives, even if it's not their career.'' Ms. McCleary, who knitted as she waited to be let in, said a friend had joked to her, ''I hope to be able to touch the hem of his lab coat, so he could cure me of my stupid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye did not disappoint. In a lecture that gave evidence of his stand-up roots, he started out with rambling asides on his his family and its generations-long fascination with sundials. He talked about the bluish tinge of shadows on Earth compared with the orangy shadows on Mars, and described the sundial that he convinced NASA to send up with the Curiosity rover. He got a little risqué with a joke about the gnomon -- the part of the sundial that sticks up, you know -- and bounced into a discussion of the hellish heat of Venus and that planet's high concentration of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He told the students that if they figured out ways to solve problems like greenhouse gases and global warming, ''You could -- dare I say it? -- change the world!'' And what's more, he added, throwing his head back for a hearty mad-scientist laugh, ''you could get rich!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the hour-and-a-half talk, those statements started out as a laugh line that got funnier through increasingly manic repetition. But he shifted his tone gradually, from goofy to fervent. By the end of his speech, it was an exhortation, a command: Change the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the question-and-answer session, a student brought up Mr. Nye's comments on evolution and creation. The problem, he explained, is that some people advocate requiring public schools to teach religious apologia as science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The earth's not 4,000, 6,000, 10,000 years old,'' he said. ''I've got no problem with anybody's religion. But if you go claiming the earth is only 10,000 years old, that's just wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The students roared their approval. As the audience streamed out -- did those dudes really rip off their shirts to show that they had painted, in all capital letters, ''Bill Nye'' on their chests and ''science'' on their backs? -- Mr. Nye looked like someone who had just run a triathlon. And then it was time for more pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, he had marveled at the chain of events that made him the Springsteen of the nerds. ''I was making a TV show. It had commercials for toys.'' Yet, he noted, ''It stands the test of time. It's very gratifying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he did then, and what he does now, are all part of the same crusade, he said. ''There's nothing I believe in more strongly than getting young people interested in science and engineering,'' he said -- ''for a better tomorrow, for all humankind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He stopped, realizing that sounded grandiose, or at least corny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not kidding,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shantel Collins and Yahaira Monzon were chatting before the start of class when their conversation was interrupted by the sound of a bell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ladies, ladies,'' said Starr Ravenhawk, one of their instructors, ''the deities demand your respect.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Collins and Ms. Monzon, both dressed in black hooded robes with silver five-pointed stars dangling from their necks, grew quiet and settled into their seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's begin,'' said Arlene Fried, another instructor, who sat behind a folding table that had been transformed into an altar, complete with candles, a chalice, a black-handled knife and a tiny caldron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Which of you can tell me what that star around your neck is called?'' Ms. Fried said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A pentacle,'' Ms. Collins replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And what is it for?'' Ms. Fried asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives us protection against anything negative or evil; it's kind of like a cross for Christians,'' Ms. Monzon said, staring into her notebook as she spoke. ''The top of the star represents the spirit. Each of the other points represent an element: earth, air, fire and water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Collins, 24, and Ms. Monzon, 34, are students at the Wiccan Family Temple Academy of Pagan Studies in Manhattan, where they are studying to become witches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know that sounds shocking to most people because witchcraft is usually thought of as evil,'' said Ms. Ravenhawk, a high priestess of the Wiccan Family Temple. ''But if people really knew what we are about, they would know that studying to become a good witch is no different than studying to become a good Catholic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen men and women are currently studying witchcraft in the mystical shadow of Ms. Ravenhawk, who helped found the school in 2007. They are enrolled in a three-year program that includes courses like ''Introduction to Wicca,'' a modern pagan, witchcraft religion that worships the divinity in nature. Other courses include ''History of Witchcraft,'' ''Introduction to Magic,'' ''Spells and How They Work'' and ''Esbats: Celebrating the Phases of the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year of introductory courses, second-year students like Ms. Collins and Ms. Monzon strive to become full-fledged witches. Third-year students aspire to become high priests or high priestesses. Each school year is made up of 24 two-hour classes, with students paying $25 per class. That amounts to 144 hours of total class work and $1,800 in tuition for any student who pursues the entire three-year curriculum, which is not accredited outside the realm of Ms. Ravenhawk's teachings and beliefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of that matters to Ms. Collins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People go to school to study the things that interest them most; some people go to law school, others to medical school,'' she said. ''I want to be a religious leader in my community, so the path I chose is to become a high priestess. I am learning how to counsel people in my community. No one is born a pastor or a reverend or a rabbi -- you have to work at it, and that's what I'm doing. So for me, these classes are worth every minute and every penny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Ms. Ravenhawk said her students ''are people with normal lives and normal jobs,'' she added that ''not all of them are willing to identify themselves and talk about it for fear of what other people might think, especially in the workplace. They are not yet ready to come out of the broom closet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Collins, a Bronx resident and former youth counselor in Manhattan, said she first became interested in the Wiccan faith when she was 13 and learned about it from a family friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was raised Baptist, but what drew me to this religion was its respect for the earth and the way it puts me in touch with nature,'' she said. ''I feel a lot more liberated in this religion; it is more respectful to me as a person and as a woman. It's basically, 'Live as you choose as long as you don't harm anyone.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Collins admitted that, like many of her classmates, she has kept her newfound religion mostly a secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My mother knows that I am a Wiccan witch, but most of my family does not,'' she said. ''People like my grandmother who are not as open-minded and do not believe in diversity, they just wouldn't understand, but this is not an evil religion. We do not worship the devil -- we do not even believe in the devil. This is about connecting with the natural forces to advance yourself spiritually.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Monzon was attempting to do just that when she approached the altar and picked up the knife, which is called an athame and is used to direct energy. ''Great mother and great father,'' she said, ''I will only use this ceremonial knife in your presence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Monzon then cut open an imaginary doorway and stepped through it, an act of leaving behind her world for a more spiritual realm. Ms. Collins and the two instructors did the same, and soon all four had formed a circle and were praying to both a male and a female god.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like people who are a part of any other religion, all we are trying to do is become better people,'' Ms. Ravenhawk said. ''And like most other religions, we accept the fact that there is a higher being.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Ravenhawk also insisted that Wiccan witches like herself do not believe in Satan, she did note that the pentacle she wears around her neck ''is said to repel vampires.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not those vampires who will drain your blood,'' she said, ''but those who will drain your energy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

I am back to a cherished point in the past -- now nearly 45 years ago -- when Neil Armstrong and I stood on that bleak, but magnificent lunar landscape called the Sea of Tranquility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we were farther away from Earth than humans had ever been, the fact is that we weren't alone. An estimated 600 million people back on Earth, at that time the largest television audience in history, watched us plant our footprints on the Moon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to today. Now I see the Moon in a far different light -- not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is time to lay the groundwork for effective global human exploration of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Apollo program adopted a get-there-in-a-hurry, straightforward space race strategy that left the former Soviet Union in the lunar dust. Doing so meant don't waste time developing reusability. Let's close that chapter in the space exploration history books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am calling for a unified international effort to explore and utilize the Moon, a partnership that involves commercial enterprise and other nations building upon Apollo. Let me emphasize: A second ''race to the Moon'' is a dead end. America should chart a course of being the leader of this international activity to develop the Moon. The United States can help other nations do things that they want to do, a fruitful avenue for U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A step in the right direction is creating an International Lunar Development Corporation, customized to draw upon the legacy of lessons learned from such endeavors as the International Geophysical Year (whose purpose was to get scientists all over the world to focus on the physics and atmosphere of the Earth), the International Space Station program, as well as model organizations such as Intelsat and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>. Space collaboration should be the new norm, including the tapping of talented Chinese, Indian and other space experts from around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my view, U.S. resources are better spent on moving toward establishing a human presence on Mars. I envision a comprehensive plan that would lead to permanent human settlement on Mars in the next 25 years. To get under way, the International Space Station can serve as a test bed for long-duration life support and for technologies that can safely, reliably and routinely transport crews to the distant shores of Mars. I've championed the creation of spacecraft to be placed on continuous loops between Mars and Earth, thereby putting in place a pathway to sustainability that forever links the two planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going to Mars means staying on Mars -- a mission by which we are building up a confidence level to become a two-planet species. At Mars, we've been given a wonderful set of moons -- one of which, perhaps Phobos, can act as an offshore world from which crews can robotically preposition hardware and establish radiation shielding on the Martian surface to begin sustaining increasing numbers of people. To succeed at Mars, you cannot stop with a one-shot foray to the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My passion for space exploration is guided by two principles: a continuously expanding human presence in space, and retention of U.S. leadership in space. To move forward, what's required is what I term as a Unified Space Vision for America that is predicated on exploration, science, development, commerce and security.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic hearts started beating a little faster last fall when a team of European astronomers announced that they had found a planet with a mass comparable to Earth's orbiting Alpha Centauri B, part of a triple star that is the Sun's nearest neighbor, only 4.4 light years from here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Geoffrey W. Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said at the time, ''This is close enough you can almost spit there.'' Close enough, some astronomers said, to send a scientific probe that would get there in our lifetime. The new planet, only four million miles from its home star, would be too hellishly hot for life, but, astronomers said, where there is one planet there are likely to be others, more comfortably situated for life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, in a shot across the bow of cosmological optimism, a new analysis of the European data has cast doubt on whether there is actually a ''there'' there at Alpha Centauri B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in The Astrophysical Journal last month, Artie P. Hatzes, the director of the Thuringian State Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany, who was not part of the original discovery team, reported that he could not confirm the planet when he went looking for it in the European data on his own. ''Sometimes it is there, other times not,'' depending on the method he used to reduce the statistical noise, he said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean the planet does not exist, Dr. Hatzes wrote, but ''in my years of experience in extracting planet signals, this simply does not 'smell' like a real planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hatzes's skepticism proved catching. Suzanne Aigrain of <span class="companylink">Oxford University</span> quoted Carl Sagan's dictum that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, saying that Dr. Hatzes's paper ''certainly casts doubt on the original evidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xavier Dumusque of the University of Geneva, who led the original discovery effort, said that Dr. Hatzes's challenge was healthy for science. ''Calling to question a detection is always something fruitful,'' Dr. Dumusque wrote in an e-mail. But he added that it was clear in his team's paper that ''the signal we are searching for is at the limit of the data precision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More data, everyone agrees, is essential, and luckily there will be more data, according to Debra Fischer, a Yale astronomer who has studied the Alpha Centauri system. Both her group and the Geneva team of which Dr. Dumusque is a member obtained more observations in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May was a bad time for exoplanet astronomers. NASA's planet-hunting Kepler satellite lost its pointing capability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quoting Jeff Lebowski, the hero of the Coen brothers movie ''The Big Lebowski,'' Dr. Hatzes said, ''Life is indeed 'gutters and strikes,' and this week were some gutters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alpha Centauri B planet is hardly the first promising world to slip into the shadows of uncertainty. Astronomers are still arguing about the existence of Gliese 581g, a ''Goldilocks'' planet said to be almost a sure bet for life when it was discovered in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all goes to show just how devilish the details have become as astronomers close in on the goal of finding Earth-like planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dumusque and his colleagues first found the planet by the so-called wobble method -- perfected over the years by Michel Mayor and his colleagues at the Geneva Observatory -- which measures planets' masses by how much they tug their host star to and fro as they orbit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group uses a specially built spectrograph called Harps on a 140-inch-diameter telescope at the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> in La Silla, Chile, to measure those wobbles, which show up as slight rhythmic shifts in the wavelength of starlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth imparts a kick of about four inches a second to the Sun as it orbits around, but that is much smaller than the jitter caused by sunspots and magnetic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that success in detecting low-mass planets depends more and more on digging a small signal out of a much larger background of noise in a reliable manner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, which uses the blink method to find planets when they cross in front of their stars, is running up against limits of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the grounds that three blinks were needed to verify an orbit, Kepler's astronomers once thought they would need three years to verify the existence of planets in comfortable orbits like our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stars turned out to be noisier than predicted; a year ago, Kepler's mission was extended so that more blinks could be collected, but the failure of a reaction wheel that allows the telescope to point precisely has probably brought an end to that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still an enormous amount of data in Kepler's pipeline, including 132 confirmed planets and, as of last week, 3,216 planet candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting in the wings for a 2017 launching is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS, which will monitor about two million nearby stars for exoplanets. ''In fact,'' the project's leader, George R. Ricker of the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, said during a talk at <span class="companylink">Google</span> a few years ago, ''when starships transporting colonists first depart the solar system, they may well be headed toward a TESS-discovered planet as their new home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might even be in Alpha Centauri.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Darwin to Einstein -- Colossal Mistakes by Great Scientists That Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mario Livio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">341 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to a fellow physicist in 1915, Albert Einstein described how a scientist gets things wrong:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''1. The devil leads him by the nose with a false hypothesis. (For this he deserves our pity.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''2. His arguments are erroneous and sloppy. (For this he deserves a beating.)''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his own rules, Einstein should have been pitied and beaten alike. ''Einstein himself certainly committed errors of both types,'' the astrophysicist Mario Livio writes in his enlightening new book, ''Brilliant Blunders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of what we read about science is some version of a success story: Scientists just discovered the oldest human fossil; how did they do it? Success is certainly part of the story, but this version of Whig history blinds us to how people actually do science. Science is a mess. It's shaped by the time and place in which scientists work. Scientists choose to do a certain experiment or interpret an observation for many reasons. ''More than 20 percent of Einstein's original papers contain mistakes of some sort,'' Livio writes. ''In several cases, even though he made mistakes along the way, the final result is still correct. This is often the hallmark of great theorists: They are guided by intuition more than by formalism.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, however, being a great scientist means being above error. That's why it is so common to see a magazine cover headline declaring, in screaming type, Einstein was wrong, or its weasel-word variant, was Einstein wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livio's book is a valuable antidote to this skewed picture. He profiles five great scientists -- Einstein, Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Linus Pauling and Fred Hoyle -- each of whom made major discoveries and major mistakes. All five put their chips down on the wrong number, even as others prevailed. Thanks to his deep curiosity, Livio turns ''Brilliant Blunders'' into a thoughtful meditation on the course of science itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Charles Darwin presented his theory of evolution in 1859, he built a foundation for all of modern biology. Crucial to his theory was the fact that animals and plants inherited traits from their ancestors. Natural selection favored some traits over others, giving rise to long-term change. But Darwin didn't know how heredity worked. He devoted a lot of time to developing ideas that, in hindsight, seem daft. ''Darwin had been educated according to the then widely held belief that the characteristics of the two parents become physically blended in their offspring,'' Livio writes, ''as in the mixing of paints.'' By this logic, each ancestor's genetic contribution would be halved in each generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This idea wasn't just wrong. It undermined Darwin's own theory of evolution. If our traits are just a result of blended particles, it shouldn't be possible for natural selection to change traits over the generations. But try as he might, Darwin couldn't figure out a better explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet right around the time that Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species,'' the Czech monk Gregor Mendel was discovering genetics. Crossing pea plants in his garden, he got a glimpse at how heredity actually does work. Darwin apparently never became aware of Mendel's work, nor did he discover Mendel's results for himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today biologists can track evolution at the molecular level because they know what genes are made of. In the early 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked out the double-helix structure of DNA. They worked quickly, because they knew that the Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Linus Pauling was trying to solve the puzzle as well. Pauling came very close, but stumbled just as Watson and Crick were making their breakthrough. He got stuck on the idea that DNA forms three intertwined spirals, rather than two, and worse, he made an elementary error in the chemistry -- his nucleic acid molecule was actually not an acid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after Crick and Watson published their discoveries in 1953, Pauling paid them a visit at Cambridge and examined their model of DNA. He acknowledged that they were right and he was wrong, and soon afterward he made the same declaration in public. That kind of graciousness is not universal among Livio's blunderers, though. The great physicist Lord Kelvin held firm, until his death in 1907, to his conviction that the Earth was only millions of years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin believed that life had been designed, and he investigated the age of the Earth in part to rebut Darwin's theory of natural selection. If Darwin's theories were right, then the Earth must be very old, but geologists had no way to precisely measure the planet's age. Kelvin had the brilliant insight that the temperature of rocks might hold the answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth, Kelvin rightly reasoned, had started out as a ball of molten rock. It took a straightforward mathematical exercise to calculate how long it had taken for the Earth to cool to its current temperature. And when Kelvin did the math, he concluded that the Earth was fairly young, roughly 100 million years (we now know it to be about 4.567 billion years old). He carried out similar calculations to work out the comparable age of the Sun. If the Sun had indeed formed billions of years ago, Kelvin believed it would have burned out long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin was wrong for two reasons. As a former student of his pointed out, Kelvin assumed that the Earth's interior was fixed and transports heat at the same rate everywhere. In fact, it roils like boiling water, transporting heat to the surface. The other reason for Kelvin's error was quantum physics. Radioactivity helps keep the Earth warm, and nuclear fusion has allowed the Sun to burn for 4.567 billion years. Kelvin's critics brought both these counterarguments to his attention, but he seems to have viewed them with contemptuous indifference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuclear fusion doesn't just power stars, it also creates new elements like carbon and iron. The British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle made this tremendous discovery in the 1940s and '50s. Unfortunately, Hoyle might be better known for promoting a flawed theory about the origin of the universe: He was convinced that the universe was in a continual state of creation. As evidence for the Big Bang mounted, he became an increasingly embarrassing crank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livio chooses Einstein as the fifth member of his blundering quintet. Einstein was puzzled as to why the universe didn't cave in on itself. Empty space, he suggested, contained a mysterious energy pushing outward, resisting the universe's inward collapse. After he published this idea -- what came to be known as the cosmological constant -- he regretted it. He said it didn't emerge naturally from his equations; he'd tacked it on like a cheap piece of plywood over a hole in a roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein eventually denounced the cosmological constant. And that, it turns out, was his big mistake. In the 1990s, physicists discovered dark energy, something very similar to that mythical force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livio brings the care of a historian to his nimble narratives, avoiding heroic clichés. He's less adept at explaining why these great scientists made their mistakes, too often trotting out pop psychology to demonstrate why people stubbornly cling to ideas even when they see evidence to the contrary. The psychology of bad science is a fascinating topic, but it requires a broader look at how the entire scientific community operates. Five scientists -- no matter how great -- cannot shoulder that load.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of what appears to be a clay-rich rock on Mars adds to the portrait of the planet as one that once -- in its youth, more than three and a half billion years ago -- was a water-rich world with conditions amenable for life, NASA scientists said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock in question, about the size of a person's forearm, was examined by the Mars rover Opportunity, the older of the spacecraft still in operation on the planet. The newer rover, the Curosity, landed last August and has been hogging the headlines ever since; in a news conference on Friday, NASA officials proudly called attention to the fact that the Opportunity, launched nearly a decade ago, was still soldiering on with valuable field work.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly discovered rock, which scientists named Esperance, is one of the oldest rocks that the Opportunity has looked at during its nine and a half years on Mars. From the abundances of elements like aluminum, calcium and magnesium, the mission's scientists concluded that the rock is very rich in clay minerals, which could have formed from copious water running over volcanic rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is powerful evidence that water interacted with this rock and changed its chemistry, changed its mineralogy in a dramatic way,'' said Steven W. Squyres, the principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity and a twin rover, the Spirit, landed on Mars in January 2004, intended for a three-month mission. The Spirit got stuck in 2009 and has not been heard from since 2010, but the Opportunity remains in ''remarkably good health,'' said John Callas, the project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is now Sol 3,331 in our 90-day rover mission,'' Dr. Callas said. A sol is a Martian day, which is 39 minutes longer than a day on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity has already found many signs of flowing water in Mars's ancient past, but of very acidic water. ''In fact, what Opportunity has mostly discovered evidence for in the past was sulfuric acid on Mars,'' Dr. Squyres said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clays in Esperance -- which means ''hope,'' but the rock was actually named after a gold mine in French Guiana where a project member had done research -- formed in more neutral waters. ''This is water you could drink,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''This is water that was probably much more favorable in its chemistry, in its pH, in its level of acidity, for things like prebiotic chemistry, the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, Dr. Squyres talked about a light-colored fine-grained rock in the same area, which appeared to possess a thin crust of clays, but otherwise had a composition typical of most Martian rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Esperance contains a much higher concentration of clays, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its limited instruments, the Opportunity cannot look for carbon-based molecules that could be the building blocks of life. The Curiosity, which landed on another part of Mars, is larger and has a more advanced chemistry laboratory, and Dr. Squyres was asked if he wished that the Opportunity had the same capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Absolutely,'' he said with a chuckle. ''No question about it. This is a treasure trove.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity is now headed for a 180-foot hill called Solander Point, less than a mile away. The slope will allow the rover to tilt its fixed solar panels northward to the Sun as winter approaches. Outcrops at Solander Point could reveal more clay-rich rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, elsewhere on Mars, the Curiosity is about to wrap up its work on a couple of intriguing rocks that have painted a similar story of the planet's early history. It will then head toward its primary goal, an 18,000-foot mountain where rocks near the base are believed to contain clay minerals. That five-mile trip is expected to take about a year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of researchers has now modified the technique, positioning a carbon monoxide molecule so that a single oxygen atom acted as a ''finger'' that felt not only carbon atoms, but also the chemical bonds between the atoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That allowed them to observe how a carbon-based molecule rearranged itself into other molecules when temperatures exceeded 194 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel, Irradiated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first humans who travel to Mars, the trade-off of fame and history will be a higher risk of dying from cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's latest robotic spacecraft on the planet, the Curiosity rover, measured the radiation it encountered during its interplanetary trip. As expected, the radiation, mostly from cosmic rays from outside the galaxy, was several hundred times as intense as what reaches the surface of the Earth, scientists announced last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For astronauts making a round trip to Mars -- six months each way using current rocket propulsion -- that would correspond to a three-percentage-point increase in the lifetime risk of a fatal cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mars lacks a magnetic field or a thick atmosphere, astronauts would absorb additional radiation during their time on Mars' surface.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iron beads from 3300 B.C. found in Egypt turn out to have an older, more distant origin. They were made from a meteorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excavated from a cemetery south of Cairo, the nine tube-shaped beads had a large amount of nickel, like iron meteorites, leading to speculation that they had been shaped out of extraterrestrial metal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study confirms the high nickel content, along with a crystal structure found only in iron meteorites.</p>

Within months, resurrected plants sprouted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Siberia, Russian scientists reported that they had extracted blood from the carcass of a woolly mammoth that had been frozen for 10,000 years, leading to speculation that the DNA might be preserved well enough to enable cloning of the extinct animal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first floating windmill in the United States went online Friday. Anchored in the Gulf of Maine, it will be able to capture the onshore breezes every sunny summer afternoon when the sun heats the land more than the ocean. Onshore wind machines generate most of their electricity at night, when it is of least use to utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prototype can generate only 20 kilowatts of electricity, but the University of Maine researchers who developed it hope it will lead to a 6-megawatt version with blades as long as the wingspan of a 747.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Badly damaged by an earthquake and an ensuing tsunami in March 2011, the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan teetered on the brink of a major disaster. A new report, however, suggests that the effects were much less dire than had been feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, published Thursday, experts on a United Nations committee say that people living around the plant received a radiation dose from the accident lower than what they get from natural background sources. There have also been no radiation-related deaths or acute effects observed among the 25,000 workers who were involved with the accident site.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or more precisely, a picture of a picture of you floating in space. But for most of us, that is as close as we will ever get to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what you get in exchange for a $25 contribution to a $1 million fund-raising effort to build a private space telescope. As of Monday, the project was already most of the way there, with more than $700,000 raised, including 18 pledges of $10,000 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A video monitor will be mounted on the orbiting telescope to display photographs of its backers. A camera will take pictures of the photos on the monitor with the Earth in the background, and beam the images back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary Resources, the company building the telescope, plans to eventually mine asteroids, and it has deep-pocketed investors like Larry Page of <span class="companylink">Google</span> who could easily kick in $1 million themselves, but company officials said they wanted to give everyone a chance to take part in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus they put their plans for their Arkyd-100 space telescope on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drive ends June 30. At higher pledge levels, you could buy telescope time for a school classroom or point it yourself for your personal astronomical observations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings could lead to a search for better shields to block the radiation, new propulsion technologies to shorten the trip, or a decision by the space agency to recalibrate the allowable risks for such an ambitious interplanetary mission.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation on the journey to Mars was measured by NASA's newest Mars rover, Curiosity, which carries an instrument the size of a coffee maker that was originally intended to gauge radiation on the planet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investigators realized that by turning on the instrument right after the rover's launching in November 2011, they could gather data on the radiation hitting the spacecraft from solar storms and from high-energy cosmic rays that come from outside the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They determined that ''the radiation environment is several hundred times more intense than it is on Earth,'' Cary Zeitlin, a scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., said during a NASA news conference on Thursday, ''and that's even inside a shielded spacecraft.'' The findings will be published in Friday's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation dosage is measured in units known as sieverts. A cumulative dose of one sievert is thought to raise the risk of a fatal cancer by about five percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Curiosity's 253-day, 350-million-mile trip, the rover absorbed about half a sievert -- an average of 1.8 thousandths of a sievert per day, mostly from cosmic rays. ''That could be higher under different circumstances,'' Dr. Zeitlin said. The instrument measured radiation from only five solar storms, all modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is not planning to send people to Mars until the 2030s, but with current technology, it would take six months to get there and six months to return to Earth. As such, astronauts would absorb about two-thirds of a sievert. By contrast, a person on Earth receives less than a thousandth of a sievert per year from outer space, Dr. Zeitlin said. Americans absorb a few thousandths of a sievert per year, mostly from X-rays and CT scans -- still much less than from a Mars trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">National Cancer Institute</span>, the lifetime risk of dying from cancer is 21 percent; the two-thirds of a sievert from a round-trip mission to Mars would raise that risk by three percentage points, to 24 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measurements largely agree with earlier estimates and measurements. ''These are confirmatory measurements that will help us refine our models,'' said Edward J. Semones, the spaceflight radiation health officer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's standards currently limit the excess cancer risk for its astronauts to three percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We currently would exceed our acceptable limits,'' Dr. Semones said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for a human mission to Mars say the radiation risk is overblown. ''What it shows is that the cosmic ray dose on a Mars mission is not a show-stopper,'' Robert Zubrin, founder and president of the Mars Society, said about the new data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is modest proportion of overall risk,'' he added. ''Therefore, what it means is that we don't need to delay a humans-to-Mars program until we have a miraculous advanced propulsion system that can get us there faster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft malfunction during the mission would pose a much greater risk to the astronauts than the radiation, Dr. Zubrin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radiation risk has also not deterred plans by a private group, the Inspiration Mars Foundation, to launch a married couple on a 501-day flyby of Mars in January 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those numbers are less than the risk a lot of people take in sports,'' said Taber MacCallum, the chief technology officer for the foundation. ''They don't seem that unreasonable to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another private group, Mars One, which hopes to establish a settlement on Mars in the 2020s, said it had already received thousands of applications.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> used a 3-D printer to create a synthetic body part that enabled a child with a rare birth defect to breathe on his own, The New England Journal of Medicine reported. The 20-month-old boy, Kaiba Gionfriddo of Youngstown, Ohio, was born with tracheobronchomalacia, in which the airway walls are so weak that they can collapse just from coughing. Kaiba had suddenly stopped breathing at 3 months and was placed on a ventilator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With emergency clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, the doctors used a digital image of Kaiba's airway to produce a tiny tracheal splint made from a biodegradable polymer. Placed inside the throat, the sprint allows the normal trachea to grow and strengthen gradually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes about two to three years for the trachea to remodel and grow into a healthy state,'' said Dr. Scott Hollister, one of two doctors who performed the operation, ''and that's about how long this material will take to dissolve into the body.'' The operation took place in February last year; Kaiba is reportedly still doing well.</p>

Now, instead of firing the nerves that detect something as sweet, glucose triggers the nerves that flag something as bitter, researchers at <span class="companylink">North Carolina State University</span> reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cockroaches began avoiding glucose-laced traps in the early 1990s, said roach experts, though until now, no one understood why. The good news is that the findings could help humans devise smarter weapons against the pests.</p>

For truly at-risk species, the annual vanishing rate is 11.6 percent. Writing in PLoS One, the researchers blamed a combination of habitat loss, climate change and disease. Interestingly, they were unable to establish a direct link between the declines and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a skin fungus that scientists have lately pointed to as a risk factor for amphibians.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Culprit of Potato Famine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 160 years, everything from fungus to slothfulness has been blamed for the Irish potato famine. But an international team of scientists, using DNA from Irish potato leaves preserved since 1847, said they had found the real culprit: a previously unknown strain of Phytophthora infestans (a funguslike microbe) they called HERB-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blight turned potatoes mushy and inedible, leading to the deaths of more than a million people during the famine, said the researchers, who published their work in the journal eLife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They think this particular strain, or its immediate ancestor, traveled north from Mexico and also to Europe, then died out and was replaced by a modern strain known as US-1. They also said their study was the first to analyze the genetics of a plant pathogen by extracting DNA from dried plant samples, opening the possibility that preserved collections from other gardens could yield clues to other plant diseases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new images taken from the Hubble Telescope reveal a different picture. ''The nebula is not like a bagel, but rather like a jelly doughnut, because it's filled with material in the middle,'' said C. Robert O'Dell, an astronomer at <span class="companylink">Vanderbilt University</span>. Dr. O'Dell led a research team that used Hubble and several other telescopes to produce the best views of the nebula to date. The new images show the ring wrapped around a football-shaped cloud of glowing helium, fueled by radiation from a white dwarf star in the middle. Following the nebula outward, that hot blue gas gives way to progressively cooler green, yellow and red gas. By studying the nebula, researchers hope to better understand the Sun's coming demise (six billion years from now, give or take).</p>

Asteroid 1998 QE2 will come within 3.6 million miles of Earth on Friday, NASA is reporting. To shoot it, you will need a 230-foot radar telescope, like the Deep Space Network antenna at the Goldstone complex in California. Astronomers there are excited to snap photos revealing the size, shape, rotation and velocity and even the origin of the hurtling rock, which is believed to be about 1.7 miles long (nine times the size of the Queen Elizabeth II, though the name of the asteroid has nothing to do with the ship). With luck, the Goldstone antenna should be able to pick up objects on the asteroid as small as 12 feet across.</p>

Unlike the Hubble telescope, which was designed to be serviced by astronauts, Kepler was meant to live far from Earth, well beyond a wrench's reach. And its Pauline-like peril and uncertain future lent some drama to this week's scientific doings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Maya Pyramid, Now Gravel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A construction crew in Belize needed crushed rock for a road-building project, so it turned to a convenient mound nearby and went at it with excavators. Soon the Nohmul pyramid, a historically significant Maya temple near the Mexican border, was reduced to a stump. ''Only a small chunk of the pyramid, which stood about 65 feet tall and was the center of a settlement of about 40,000 people in 250 B.C., remains after backhoes and bulldozers began removing the limestone slabs with which it was built,'' as CNN put it. The government of Belize wants to find and prosecute those responsible, as do local archaeologists. ''The Maya had to mine for this material using nothing more than stone tools,'' Dr. Jaime J. Awe of the Belize Institute of Archaeology told a Belize news station, adding that it was ''mind-boggling'' that this treasured antiquity, which took centuries to build, had been wrecked in a day by machinery that could have quarried elsewhere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember Measles?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 1,200 cases of measles have cropped up in Britain this year, on top of 2,000 reported last year, and public health officials say that parents who refused to vaccinate their children are to blame. ''More than a decade ago, British parents refused to give measles shots to at least a million children because of now discredited research that linked the vaccine to autism,'' The Associated Press reported. ''Now, health officials are scrambling to catch up and stop a growing epidemic.'' Although developing countries still struggle with measles, the disease has all but disappeared in richer nations, except where there have been vaccine resisters. The current outbreak, centered in Wales, puts Britain behind countries like Rwanda and Cambodia in combating measles. While the research linking autism to the vaccine against measles has been found to be fraudulent and the doctor who did it has lost his medical license, some parents still refuse to inoculate their children.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a glove tossed down to climate change deniers, a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters looked at about 4,000 scientific articles about global warming and found that 97.1 percent of them concluded that rising temperatures were ''anthropogenic,'' or caused by humans. ''Our findings prove that there is a strong scientific agreement about the cause of climate change, despite public perceptions to the contrary,'' said John Cook, a postdoctoral fellow at the <span class="companylink">University of Queensland</span>, according to an article in The Guardian. Dr. Cook is a physicist, not a climate scientist, but he collects peer-reviewed papers on climate change the way some people do ''Star Trek'' memorabilia; he also maintains SkepticalScience.com, which includes a list of the ''most used climate myths and what the science really says.'' Myth No. 1: ''Climate's Changed Before.'' No. 2: ''It's the Sun.'' No. 3: ''It's Not Bad.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler spacecraft has been an astronomical marvel, sending down a steady drumbeat of information that scientists use to map exotic planets far outside our solar system. But now it is in trouble, and the prospects for repair are dubious. Kepler, which is only about 9 feet by 15 feet, has four reaction wheels that are meant to keep it pointed in the right direction; at least three of them need to be working properly, and right now only two are. NASA will try to wiggle them back to life, but astronomers are deeply worried that their window to the world of exoplanets may have snapped shut. Kepler has already found more than 100 planets, providing ''a mother lode of planetary systems that we will be exploring for decades in the future,'' as Dimitar Sasselov, a Harvard professor who is one of Kepler's investigators, told The Harvard Gazette. ''Kepler has already delivered beyond expectations,'' he added. ''So it was worth every penny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bennu or Bust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of space: NASA's plan to snatch a chunk of an asteroid and bring it back to Earth moved a bit closer to fruition last week. Under the current timeline, a play date with the asteroid in question -- named Bennu -- will take place in 2018, two years after a spacecraft is launched for this purpose. By 2023, that spacecraft will return with a piece of Bennu, no less than 2.1 ounces, after a round trip of more than 800 million miles. The project, known by the ungainly acronym Osiris-REx, might tell us a lot; as NASA put it bluntly: ''Bennu could hold clues to the origin of the solar system.'' So what's with the asteroid's name? The Bennu was a mythical heronlike bird in ancient Egypt; a third grader from North Carolina, thinking the mission's equipment looked somewhat birdlike, submitted the name to an asteroid-naming competition and won.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone has a 50-foot-wide electromagnet to spare. Fortunately for the scientists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, who need just such an item, their colleagues at <span class="companylink">Brookhaven National Laboratory</span> do have one sitting around. Both labs are run by the Department of Energy, and a transfer was arranged, which will be easier said than done: The 600-ton device, used to store subatomic particles called muons, will take a circuitous two-month, 3,200-mile journey from Brookhaven, N.Y., to Batavia, Ill. ''The massive electromagnet must be transported in one piece,'' according to a news release from Brookhaven. ''It also cannot tilt or twist more than a few degrees, or the complex wiring inside will be irreparably damaged.'' Popular Science said the electromagnet ''will float from New York Harbor in June, down the East Coast, around Florida, up the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi River by July.'' After it arrives, the storage ring will function as a holding tank for muons generated by Fermilab's particle accelerators, under an experiment called Muon g-2 that will look at odd properties of matter in the subatomic world.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaction wheels like the ones that NASA officials say have failed aboard the Kepler spacecraft, effectively ending its mission to detect potentially habitable planets outside the solar system, are simple devices, at least in concept. But making ones that can survive the rigors of a rocket launching and then spin for a long time to keep a spacecraft properly oriented -- in Kepler's case, to keep its telescope precisely pointed at the same field of stars -- is difficult.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really simply, it's an electric motor turning a flywheel,'' said Doug Sinclair, whose Toronto company, Sinclair Interplanetary, makes tiny reaction wheels for suitcase-size satellites. Kepler's wheels are bigger because Kepler is bigger (with a mass of more than a ton), but they function in the same way: The rapidly spinning flywheel is accelerated or decelerated, producing a corresponding slow rotation of the spacecraft in one direction or the other. The principle at work is one that physics students and figure skaters are familiar with: conservation of angular momentum. There must be at least three wheels, one on each of three perpendicular axes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft's thrusters could also be used to control orientation, but there is a limited amount of propellant aboard. Reaction wheels use electricity, which can be produced in essentially unlimited supply by a spacecraft's solar panels. But Victoria L. Coverstone, a professor of aerospace engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Illinois</span>, said that in some situations thrusters must still be used. The solar wind can cause a small, constant rotation of the spacecraft that can make a reaction wheel rotate faster and faster until it reaches its operational limit. When that happens, she said, a thruster can be fired to rotate the spacecraft in the opposite direction and slow the wheel, a procedure referred to as a ''momentum dump.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler has four wheels, providing some redundancy. One stopped working last July after about three years of operation, and NASA announced last week that a second had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sinclair said the most likely source of failure was in the flywheel bearings. ''That is the No. 1 challenge in building a wheel,'' he said. ''When you launch, you shake this thing, and you're supporting this heavy flywheel on these bearings. That beats them up. Then you spin them for years.'' HENRY FOUNTAIN</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as hard as it is to see your youngsters lose their innocence just like that, tiptoeing around the topic of scary stuff in our cosmos will only create worse problems.

So shouldn't news of our planet's complete vulnerability come out of your mouth first? Take the initiative early on. That way you can at least reassure her that, as far as killer asteroids go, she's much more likely to die on an amusement-park ride or at a fireworks display.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently I was lying on a blanket in the backyard between my 7-year-old twins, Mark and Missy. We were up way past bedtime, savoring a spectacularly starry night sky. I really got going about supernova explosions of massive stars and about how this results in tremendous gamma-ray bursts that can shoot deadly beams of intense radiation many light years through space, and how, if one ever reached the Earth, it would spell extinction for everyone. I avoided the temptation to sugarcoat things. The twins needed me to tell it like it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Mark sobbed away hysterically while Missy asked one simple question: ''Are we still gonna get a Christmas tree?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure we are,'' I said, and told the kids they'd probably have Christmas trees for the rest of their lives. I emphasized that it could even take thousands of years for any gamma ray burst to zero in on Earth and so, no worries -- we'd be long dead by then anyway. Eventually, maybe, they will take some comfort in that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard trying to control your children's feelings. Yesterday, when I told them about the chances of a huge comet someday crossing Earth's path, they became very frightened indeed. But, to my credit, I let them know that it was perfectly normal to feel scared -- I'm scared, too, I confessed -- and gave them probably too many reassuring hugs. Then I microwaved popcorn and we watched ''C.S.I.'' together, and the twins' questions turned refreshingly earthbound: What's rigid mortis? Do kids ever have to get that life insurance? How do vultures know you're dead and that you're not just knocked out? And, What does sexy mean? (''Ask your mother next week'' -- I wimped out on that one.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honesty and directness are the best tools for ever so gently shattering your children's assumption that our planet is a safe and secure place. And if this sometimes makes them feel that their lives on Earth are somehow less meaningful -- hey, welcome to the club. But steer clear of the planetarium, unless it's Laser Rock Night. Then by all means go, even if the homework isn't done.</p>

''It was one of those things that was a gift to humanity,'' said one astronomer, who spoke on condition of anonymity before NASA made the news public. ''We're all going to lose, for sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in March 2009, orbits the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Its mission is to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that harbor Earth-like planets by carrying out a survey of some 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of their suns. The spacecraft has identified 130 planets and 2,740 other candidates. About 230 are the size of Earth, and 820 others are only twice as big as Earth and are probably rocky worlds similar to our own, Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler's mission has cost $600 million so far. It was designed to operate for four years, but last year it was extended three more years, until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Earth transits the Sun only once a year, two more years would give astronomers a chance to see more transits of the planets they are looking for, ones with orbits similar to our own. Without the extra time, the data will be noisy, astronomers say, so the answer will be a little more uncertain than it might have been. Geoffrey Marcy, a Kepler astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said that without more data coming from Kepler, he thought astronomers would be ''right on the edge'' of answering the question of how common other Earths are, but with less statistical certainty than originally desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, engineers noticed that one of the reaction wheels that keep the spacecraft pointed was experiencing too much friction. They shut down the spacecraft for a couple of weeks to give it a rest, in the hope that the wheel's lubricant would spread out and solve the problem. But when they turned it back on, the friction was still there. Until now, the problem had not interfered with observations, but on Tuesday, the spacecraft went into a so-called safe mode, and the engineers determined that the reaction wheel had stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels, but one failed last year after showing signs of erratic friction. Three wheels are required to keep Kepler properly and precisely aimed, and now there are only two. The lack of three working wheels probably robs it of the ability to point precisely enough to detect Earth-size planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project managers hope to remedy the situation by rocking the wheel back and forth, or perhaps resurrecting the wheel that failed last year, an effort that will probably take several months, according to Kepler's deputy project manager, Charles Sobeck of the Ames Research Center. It would take that long as well to figure out what else the telescope, which is itself in fine condition, can be used for if it can no longer hunt planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki said that the Kepler project had been a long journey -- and a phenomenal success -- and that he was not ready to pronounce it over. When Kepler was conceived, he said, nobody knew if any other stars had planets; now we know that almost every star in the galaxy has a planet and that the nearest exoplanet might be only 10 light-years away. ''I'm delighted and surprised with what we have done,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Grunsfeld, who played mechanic to the Hubble telescope during several lengthy spacewalks, the Kepler malfunction looked particularly frustrating. ''Unfortunately, it's not in a place where I can go and fix it,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EQUILATERAL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Ken Kalfus</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 207 pp. Bloomsbury. $24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set in the scorching heat of the Egyptian desert at the end of the 19th century, Ken Kalfus's new novel follows a fictional British astronomer's attempt to make contact with Mars. Hundreds of thousands of men are digging the gigantic equilateral triangle with which Sanford Thayer intends to send a signal to his fellow astronomers on the red planet. Once finished, each side will consist of a paved trench more than 300 miles long and exactly one seventy-third of Earth's circumference. The trenches, five miles wide, are deep enough to be filled with a 12-inch layer of petroleum that will flow from 309 taps connected to a pipeline. The huge black triangle set against the white desert sand will prove the existence of terrestrial intelligence to the Martians, Thayer argues, because the equal-sided triangle is part of the two planets' ''shared knowledge of trigonometry.'' The equilateral triangle is, he believes, the ''basis for all human art and construction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thayer and his crew are in a race against time. As Earth and Mars move closer to each other in their orbital dance -- half a million miles each day -- a deadline is approaching. According to Thayer's calculations, the giant triangle needs to be finished by June 17, 1894, when Earth will be at its most advantageously visible from Mars. That night Thayer and his team will light the petroleum, creating a huge flare that will ''petition for man's membership in the fraternity of planetary civilizations.'' Thayer is utterly convinced that his audacious enterprise will attract the attention and admiration of his distant, alien colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''Equilateral,'' Kalfus, who was a National Book Award finalist for his previous novel, ''A Disorder Peculiar to the Country,'' takes as his starting point the true story of late-19th-century astronomers who believed they had discovered elaborate artificial canal systems on Mars. Among them was the American Percival Lowell, who insisted that he had seen irrigation channels and seasonal color changes like the greening of fields. This was enough to convince him that the red planet was inhabited by intelligent beings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kalfus cleverly moves from these historical facts to Thayer's brazen invented project, using them as steppingstones to tell the story of a spectacularly bold, obsessive and outrageously arrogant man. Thayer believes in the progress of science and mankind. Inspired by Darwin's ''Origin of Species,'' he expects planets to evolve just as plants and animals do. Since Mars is an older planet than Earth, Thayer says, he hopes to learn from the Martians how to ''assemble the social, spiritual and material resources necessary to survive a dehydrating planet.'' But while his great triangle in the desert has been conceived to ''benefit the whole of humanity,'' regardless of nation and religion, it's been financed by the so-called Mars Concession, an international consortium of private shareholders and governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are problems. Thayer's workers are threatening to strike, limestone impedes the progress of the digging, men are killed, a factory manufacturing pitch for the trenches is seriously damaged, creating further delays. And Thayer himself is increasingly debilitated by fevers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another triangle in this story, which may take the idea a little too literally -- one involving Thayer; his loyal and smart secretary, Miss Keaton; and an alluring Arab servant girl who speaks no English. Miss Keaton is an accomplished astronomer herself; she also runs much of the operation in the desert. She and Thayer have in the past been more than just colleagues, but as he falls deeper into the delirium caused by his illness, he becomes strangely -- elusively, ultimately unconvincingly -- attracted to the subservient servant girl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">t just over 200 pages, ''Equilateral'' sometimes feels too slender, its characters one-dimensional, leaving the reader with little emotional investment in Thayer and his companions. But Kalfus writes so well that his storytelling carries us along. Only rarely does his language become overdrawn, as when he points out the ''lush lactic wash of the Milky Way'' or notes that the servant girl is as ''supple as a cat and as fecund as the Nile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the end, though, Kalfus redeems ''Equilateral'' with some fine twists as the narrative becomes darker and more complex, evolving into a more intricate fable, an exploration of man's hubris. As the world awaits word from the Martians, Thayer's dream of intergalactic communication and the progress of science turns into an economic equation. A majestic customs house, 200 feet high and made of the finest Portland stone, adorned with soaring columns, is erected at one of the corners of the gigantic triangle, a fitting symbol of what this enterprise is really about: trade, exploitation, colonialism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it is announced that Herr Krupp, Mr. Rockefeller and Baron Rothschild are expected to join the officials assembled in the desert, it becomes clear that Thayer has served his purpose. From now on, ''men of business will have to take center stage.'' Miss Keaton's protest that ''the Equilateral is meant to serve humanity'' is the last reminder of what it had once signified. Meanwhile the Concession is waiting to cash in on its ''monopoly on trade with Mars.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts, Thomas H. Marshburn and Christopher Cassidy, both American, spent 5 ½ hours outside the space station. They were unable to locate the source of the leak, but did install a new pump, which appeared to solve the problem.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new pump started up normally, and with the two astronauts looking for escaping crystals of ammonia coolant, there were no signs of the leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not seeing anything,'' Dr. Marshburn reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure in the coolant loop was also holding, another indicator that the problem had been resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, astronauts spotted a stream of frozen flakes emanating from one of the station's trusses. From videos, engineers concluded that the source of the leaks was a pump that pushes ammonia coolant to regulate temperatures on one of the eight expansive solar arrays, which provide electricity to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each array has an independent cooling loop, and the leak did not have an immediate impact on the day-to-day operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said there was no danger to the six-member crew. But they worried that if a problem developed with a second cooling loop, the station might have had to cut back on its power consumption, limiting science experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has tussled with coolant leaks previously and last November, two other astronauts took a spacewalk to fix a leak in the same general area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been something that has been troubling us for some time,'' Joel Montalbano, the deputy space station program manager, said at a news conference after the spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balky loop had been losing coolant at a rate of five pounds per year, but on Thursday, that rate jumped to five pounds per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three of the crew members, including Dr. Marshburn, scheduled to head back to Earth on Monday, NASA decided it would be prudent to repair the leak sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than 48 hours, plans for the spacewalk and the repairs were put together. At 8:44 a.m. Eastern time on Saturday, Dr. Marshburn and Mr. Cassidy switched on the power to their spacesuits, marking the start of the spacewalk. When they reached the site of the suspected leak, at the far left end of the space station, they were not able to spot evidence of it. Even after removing the pump, they did not see much unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks really, really clean,'' Dr. Marshburn said. ''Surprisingly so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers thought the leak could be inside the pump and decided that a new one should be installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marshburn and Mr. Cassidy did take a moment to admire the view as they passed over the southern end of Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Did you see the moon?'' Dr. Marshburn asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did, oh my God!'' Mr. Cassidy replied. ''Burn that in your memory!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the 168th spacewalk related to construction or maintenance of the space station since the first piece of the space complex was launched in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're happy, we're very happy,'' Mr. Montalbano said after the repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warned that it would be weeks or months before engineers were confident that the problem would not recur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,'' Mr. Montalbano said.</p>

Its first issue, which appeared online on April 29, focuses on a single theme: what does or does not make the human race special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It uses as an epigraph a 1995 statement from Stephen Hawking, the English physicist and man about the universe: ''The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides a couple of dozen articles on that theme, on topics from astronomy to robotics to neuroscience, there is a lineup of blogs, interviews and even a piece of fiction, about a future in which nobody reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the extras is an entertaining interview with Robert A.F. Thurman, the Buddhist scholar and father of Uma, who says he loves Dr. Hawking's comment. ''That's a key the Buddhist found long ago,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Steele, the founder, publisher and editorial director of the magazine -- which was started with a grant from the <span class="companylink">John Templeton Foundation</span> -- described his vision of it as ''a New Yorker version of Scientific American.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future issues will each be devoted to a single topic -- ''uncertainty,'' ''secrets'' -- in all its cosmic ramifications. It is the only science magazine I know that lists a pair of ''contract philosophers'' on its masthead. The editor in chief, Michael Segal, has a doctorate in electrical engineering and was an editor at Nature Nanotechnology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magazine will not come out all at once, but in online ''chapters'' each Thursday. Physically, it is to appear quarterly; subscriptions are $49 a year; Mr. Steele hopes for an initial base of 5,000 subscribers. A few copies of an abridged version of the first issue have been produced: Its 44 thick, color pages have the luxurious production values of a corporate report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will not come as news that Mr. Steele faces odds at least as daunting as any prospective gene mapper or planet explorer. Magazines and newspapers, after all, are supposed to be going the way of buggy-whip factories. Science journalism, in particular, is a field littered with corpses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many science writers at The New York Times, including me, hatched their careers working at a wave of glossy monthly science magazines that were started in the late 1970s and early '80s, fueled by the belief that curiosity about the universe was not only part of the good life but a necessity in a democratic society facing decisions about nuclear energy, medicine, the space program and the arms race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times started its science section in 1978. A year later the same folks who publish Penthouse brought forth Omni, a mix of science and speculation. In rapid succession the <span class="companylink">American Association for the Advancement of Science</span>, publisher of the journal Science, started Science79; <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>. started Discover; and Science Digest expanded to a full-size glossy magazine. <span class="companylink">The New York Academy of Sciences</span> published The Sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This profusion led to a hiring frenzy for science journalists, who, for a golden while anyway, had a blast producing magazines on scales of time and money that seem unworldly today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade later most were gone or struggling for lack of advertising, despite circulations in the range of half a million and despite the growing importance of science in an age of climate change, energy crises and AIDS. The lone survivor of that golden era, Discover, has been sold four times. A more recent arrival, Seed, noted for its edginess, exists only online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The audience has fragmented among stalwarts like National Geographic and Scientific American; blogs; and new-media adventures like the TED talks, the World Science Festival and Edge.org, the online salon, and Simons Science News, a new effort by the mathematician and philanthropist James H. Simons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steele, 60, who studied philosophy before an eclectic career that included being a gofer for Walter Cronkite and the Rome bureau chief for NBC, hatched the idea for Nautilus a year ago, after the death of a colleague reminded him, as he says, that life is not a dress rehearsal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online magazine is free, but even if it weren't, it would be worth the price of admission to read a ''preview issue'' that describes various aspects of the term ''nautilus'': mollusk, name of Captain Nemo's submarine in ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and paragon of mathematical beauty. Peter Ward, a paleontologist, describes his adventures and misadventures chasing the mollusk through the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nautilus is so steeped in math and myth and story, from Verne to the Golden Mean to the spectacular sea creature itself,'' Mr. Steele said, ''that it seemed a fitting namesake for the idea of connecting and illuminating science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He shopped his idea to the Templeton Foundation, perhaps best known for its annual $1.7 million prize for the advancement of spirituality (this year's winner was Desmond M. Tutu) but also an enthusiastic supporter of what it calls Big Ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is viewed with suspicion in some scientific circles as having a religious agenda. Mr. Steele said that other than approving the concept, it had no editorial input.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grant gives the staff time to build an audience, to gather data to present to potential advertisers, and to figure out how to make money, Mr. Steele said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got to look under every stone for ways to monetize this stuff,'' he added. ''We're not making buggy whips or biplanes. There is an audience for good stories.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amen, brother.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the more fanciful conceptions of nature, the British physicist and philosopher Julian Barbour proposed that the world is just a ''heap of moments,'' each an instant of frozen time. There is no order to the moments, no sequence, no cause-and-effect relationship. We exist only from moment to moment. If we experience time passing, it's because this particular moment has memories of another moment woven into it. Some moments are interesting: they contain complexity, stars and planets, life. Others are boring: they contain only energy, or perhaps nothing at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his new book, ''Time Reborn,'' Lee Smolin, a physicist and author of ''The Life of the Cosmos'' (1997) and ''The Trouble With Physics'' (2006), recounts Barbour's cosmology with some admiration and then goes on to offer even more radical ideas of his own. Smolin argues that the Now has been taken out of physics, and it is time to put it back in. For example, Smolin says that Newtonian physics expresses the notion that the future is determined by the past and so, in a sense, the future already exists. He rightly remarks that Einsteinian physics frames time as a relative concept in which the line between past and future varies with the observer. To remedy these perceived problems, he suggests major structural revisions to the two fundamental pillars of modern physics, relativity and quantum mechanics. His book, a mix of science, philosophy and science fiction, is at once entertaining, thought-provoking, fabulously ambitious and fabulously speculative. Although full of wonderful metaphors and analogies, it may prove heavy sledding for many readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twentieth-century physics has brought us two kinds of strangeness: strange things we more or less understand, and strange things we do not understand. The first category includes relativity and quantum mechanics. Relativity reveals that time is not absolute. Clocks in relative motion to each other tick at different rates. We don't notice relativity in daily life because the relative speed must be close to the speed of light before the effects are significant. Quantum mechanics presents a probabilistic picture of reality; subatomic particles act as if they occupy many places at once, and their locations can be described only in terms of probabilities. Although we can make accurate predictions about the average behavior of a large number of subatomic particles, we cannot predict the behavior of a single subatomic particle, or even a single atom. We don't feel quantum mechanics because its effects are significant only in the tiny realm of the atom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The category of strange things we do not understand includes the origin of the universe and the nature of the ''dark energy'' that pervades the cosmos. Over the last 40 years, physicists have realized that various universal parameters, like the mass of the electron (a type of subatomic particle) and the strength of the nuclear force (the force that holds the subatomic particles together within the centers of atoms), appear to be precisely calibrated. That is, if these parameters were a little larger or a little smaller than they actually are, the complex molecules needed for life could never have formed. Presumably, the values of these parameters were set at the origin of the universe. Fifteen years ago, astronomers discovered a previously unknown and still unexplained cosmic energy that fills the universe and acts as an antigravity-like force, pushing the galaxies apart. The density of this dark energy also appears to be extraordinarily fine-tuned. A little smaller or a little larger, and the life-giving stars would never have formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The haunting question is why these fundamental parameters lie in the narrow range required by life. What determined their values? One explanation offered by physicists, called the ''anthropic principle,'' is that there are, in fact, a great many universes, with widely varying properties and parameters. In most other universes, the strength of the nuclear force, the density of the dark energy and so on are much different than in ours. Those universes would be lifeless and barren. By definition, we live in one of the universes with parameters that allow life, because otherwise we would not be here to ask the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smolin has his own theory to explain why we live in a life-supporting universe, which he calls ''cosmological natural selection.'' He proposes that new universes are spawned at the centers of black holes. As in biological natural selection, those universes with the right parameters for producing new black holes have descendants; those that do not disappear. What's more, it turns out that some of the conditions needed to form black holes, such as the right parameters to form stars, are the same as those needed for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its appeal, there are several problems with Smolin's theory. First, there is no evidence that new universes are created at the centers of black holes. Second, even if such evidence existed, why would the parameters of a universe so created bear any resemblance to the parameters of its parent universe, as required by the theory? If the parameters differ by more than a little, the new universe would not have ''survivable'' characteristics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmological natural selection does have one feature that relates to Smolin's dissatisfaction with the relativity of time. The succession of parent and descendant universes necessarily unfolds in time, and Smolin believes that this is ''real'' time (as opposed to what he calls the ''unreal'' and ''inessential'' conceptions of time in traditional physics).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He goes on to propose a variety of revolutionary ideas to codify further his notion of ''real time.'' In one, he suggests that every atom in the universe is causally connected to every other atom in the universe, no matter how many light-years away. According to his notion, the failure of standard quantum mechanics to predict the behavior of individual atoms arises from the fact that it does not take into account the vast numbers of interconnections extending across the universe. Furthermore, this picture of the cosmos requires an absolute time (in violation of relativity), which he calls ''preferred global time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Smolin's most astonishing ideas is something he calls the ''principle of precedence,'' that repeated measurements of a particular phenomenon yield the same outcomes not because the phenomenon is subject to a law of nature but simply because the phenomenon has occurred in the past. ''Such a principle,'' Smolin writes, ''would explain all the instances in which determinism by laws work but without forbidding new measurements to yield new outcomes, not predictable from knowledge of the past.'' In Smolin's view such unconstrained outcomes are necessary for ''real'' time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting aside the sensational ideas proposed in ''Time Reborn,'' it is a triumph of modern physics that we are even asking such questions as what determined the initial conditions of the universe. In previous centuries, these conditions were either accepted as given or attributed to the handiwork of the gods. A triumph, and also possibly a defeat. For if we must appeal to the existence of other universes -- unknown and unknowable -- to explain our universe, then science has progressed into a cul-de-sac with no scientific escape.</p>

At the time, Bell was trying feverishly to develop audio technology that would best his archrival, Thomas Edison, who had recorded ''Mary Had a Little Lamb'' on embossed foil in 1877, according to the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian Institution</span>, which owns a collection of Bell's artifacts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, for the first time, anyone with an Internet connection could hear Bell's voice, which had been lost to posterity. In the 1880s, Bell and his colleagues had used everything from ''metal, wax, glass, paper, plastic, foil and cardboard'' to record sound and embed it on discs or cylinders, but modern audiologists had been unable to play them back. (The work came after Bell's development of the telephone: the ephemeral and unrecorded plea ''Mr. Watson, come here -- I want to see you'' was made in 1876.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puzzled by the mute Bell discs, a curator from the <span class="companylink">National Museum of American History</span> reached out to a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Carl Haber, who had ''succeeded in extracting sound from early recordings made in Paris in 1860,'' according to the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> account. ''He and his team created high-resolution optical scans converted by computer into an audio file.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They brought in a specialist from the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span>, as well as Patrick Feaster, a sound historian at Indiana University. Until recently, Dr. Feaster wrote in The Atlantic, little recorded sound had survived from before Edison introduced his Perfected Phonograph in 1888; a breakthrough came in 2008, when a collaboration called First Sounds, which included Dr. Haber and Dr. Feaster, was able to restore a French recording from 1860, a 10-second snippet of ''Au Clair de la Lune'' made on a phonautogram.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 20, 2012, the team working on the 1885 Bell recording ''was transfixed as it listened to the inventor himself,'' Charlotte Gray, a Bell biographer, wrote in <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> magazine. Ms. Gray had wondered if Bell, who was born in Scotland but had lived in England, Canada and the United States, would have a Scottish burr. The answer was no, but ''the intonation of the British Isles was unmistakable in Bell's speech,'' she wrote. ''The voice is vigorous and forthright.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Animals Aloft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Noah had had a Soyuz rocket, he might have tried this: On Friday, a Russian and American collaboration launched a menagerie of small animals into orbit, sending geckos, mice, gerbils, snails and other creatures to space for a month. The Bion-M1 mission is ''the longest flight of its kind in the Russian science program's 40-year history,'' according to the news Web site Space.com. The goal is to ''help scientists understand how long-duration human spaceflight might affect astronauts.'' One alluring detail: NASA scientists will be studying sperm motility in the spacefaring mice to try to figure out if humans could successfully procreate on a long space voyage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cellphones Aloft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate launching, NASA sent three smartphones into orbit last week, hoping to see if the technology inside them is powerful enough to serve as the core of future low-cost satellites. The PhoneSats, as NASA calls them, are off-the-shelf <span class="companylink">Google</span> HTC Nexus One smartphones, running the Android operating system, that are supposed to spend about 10 days beaming photos and other information back to Earth. They were sent up by <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, a NASA contractor, on the maiden flight of its Antares rocket. And -- in a convenient echo of our opening theme -- ''the three devices orbiting Earth right now are cutely named Alexander, Graham and Bell, respectively,'' noted National Journal. But unlike the spacebound animals, which are expected to return alive, ''the phones will re-enter the atmosphere, burning up in the process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Field Research</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holding Science Captive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, scientists are worried about the sequester, but some are at the mercy of something more mercurial than Congress: Somali pirates, who have effectively shut down fieldwork in the erratic patch of Indian Ocean they trawl. ''There's been no data coming out of this area for years. Zero,'' Tim White, a Berkeley anthropologist whose work on hominid fossils in East Africa has been thwarted, said in an interview with National Geographic. The pirates of Somalia have created a ''data hole'' for scientists in ''subjects as diverse as plate tectonics, plankton evolution, oceanography, and climate change,'' the magazine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Painkillers and Marathoners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although lots of marathon runners take over-the-counter analgesics before they race, trying to keep the pain at a dull roar, they could actually be making things worse for themselves, the journal BMJ Open said. In a study of 4,000 runners from the Bonn Marathon in Germany in 2010, researchers found that ''runners who used painkillers had a 13 percent increased risk of 'adverse events' including muscle cramps and intestinal cramps,'' The Guardian reported. Apparently the painkillers people took -- which included ibuprofen and aspirin, as well as an anti-inflammatory called diclofenac -- interfered with the way the body contracts and relaxes muscle tissue. The higher the doses, the greater the risk of problems. All in all, ''analgesics taken prophylactically before racing do not prevent pain,'' the study said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on Friday, when everyone was riveted to the manhunt in Boston, an online video from the International Space Station about that question was a suspenseful and intriguing diversion. What happened to the water in microgravity turned out to be ''much more interesting than what happens here on earth,'' as The Los Angeles Times put it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before we give you the answer, here's the context: Canada's equivalent of NASA held a contest for schoolchildren, asking them to design a simple experiment that the Canadian astronaut aboard the space station could perform using particular household items, office supplies and the like. The list of nearly 50 items included dental floss, nylon running shorts, ketchup, mustard and a magnifying glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two 10th-grade girls from Nova Scotia, together with their science teacher, came up with the wet washcloth idea, chosen from nearly 100 entries. So last Tuesday, the commander of the space station, Chris Hadfield, a veteran spacewalker, recorded a video in which, with a microphone bobbing near his mouth, he unfurled a white washcloth, squirted drinking water onto it, then twisted the saturated cloth. In what looked like a magic trick, the water began surrounding the washcloth in a thick layer, then migrated outward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's becoming a tube of water,'' Commander Hadfield said, staring intently at the cloth over his signature mustache. ''It wrings out of the cloth onto my hands.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the surface tension of the water, he explained, the fluid ran along the exterior of the fabric and onto him, where it stuck, ''almost like you had Jell-O on your hand.'' He wiped his wet hands and left the washcloth, still twisted, dangling in place. ''Great experiment, worked perfectly,'' he said. The 10th graders had predicted the outcome spot on. ''Their hypothesis that the water would not drip in microgravity but rather remain on the washcloth was proven correct,'' as the <span class="companylink">Canadian Space Agency</span> put it in a news release. ''In the absence of gravity to pull the water down, it took a shake or a quick squeeze from Commander Hadfield for the washcloth to release the water.'' Or, as one person commented on the video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, ''Everything is cooler in space.''</p>

''Rescued as a cub, Champa stood out from the start,'' the magazine said. ''She had a protruding forehead and had trouble socializing with the other bears at the sanctuary. Over time, her growth slowed, her behavior became more erratic, and her vision faded.'' Euthanizing Champa was not considered an option in the largely Buddhist country, so a British veterinary surgeon, Romain Pizzi, who describes his specialty as ''minimally invasive 'keyhole' surgery of wildlife,'' operated on her, just as he has done on seals, reindeer and jaguars. Six weeks post-op, Champa looked perkier, her caretakers said; she had gained weight and grown chummier with other bears.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warding Off Breast Cancer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has long been a thorny topic: Should healthy women take tamoxifen and raloxifene, powerful drugs that can reduce their risk of breast cancer but can also cause life-threatening strokes and blood clots? Some resolution arrived last week, when the <span class="companylink">United States Preventive Services Task Force</span> -- a gold standard among medical experts -- recommended that doctors offer to prescribe the drugs for women with higher than average risk of breast cancer and low risks of blood clots and strokes. The drugs work by blocking the effects of estrogen in breast tissue, where it can stimulate the growth of some tumors. ''These medicines may have benefits for women who are at increased risk of breast cancer and at low risk for harms from the medicines,'' the task force said in a fact sheet, but ''women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer should not use tamoxifen or raloxifene to reduce their risk for breast cancer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infant Development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Do Babies Know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-month-old infants can't tell you what they are seeing and thinking (though their mothers can, of course). But if you attach electrode caps to their heads -- which is harmless, though it looks disturbing -- you can get a glimpse of their brain activity. A French neuroscientist did this, plopping infants in their parents' laps and measuring the neural patterns generated when the babies viewed a face flashed on a screen. In results that seem oddly reassuring, the babies showed the same brain reactions that adults do -- a ''two-phase pattern that would indicate consciousness,'' as the Web site LiveScience put it -- but it took them longer to get there. ''In 5-month-olds, it took 1.3 seconds for the second flurry of brain activity to show up,'' LiveScience noted. ''In adults, the timing is closer to three-tenths of a second.'' The small study, which was published in Science, adds weight to the argument that very young infants are conscious of their surroundings, meaning that their reactions are not just reflexive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth Shakings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two bits of seismic activity news came up last week -- totally separate, both startling. One was that the horrific fertilizer plant explosion in West, Tex., which caused at least 14 deaths and left a wide swath of devastation, was so powerful that the <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span> registered it as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake. And the seismic impact of Hurricane Sandy last October may have been the same or larger: Keith D. Koper, a geophysicist at the University of Utah, and a colleague reported that waves pounding the seafloor generated ''microseisms'' that were picked up around the country. ''There is no magnitude scale for the microseisms generated by Sandy, but Koper says they range from roughly 2 to 3 on a quake magnitude scale,'' ScienceDaily, a news Web site, reported. ''The conversion is difficult because earthquakes pack a quick punch, while storms unleash their energy for many hours.''</p>

The report reads like dystopian fiction: a Category 4, for instance, would lead to a 15-foot storm surge, with Grand Central and Penn Station inundated, hundreds of cars submerged in the tunnels leading out of Manhattan and a regional blackout. I also relied on studies commissioned by FEMA and New York City's Office of Emergency Management, publicly available for years. Bad news all -- and, as it turned out, accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists and government officials knew what would happen when Sandy hit, just as they know what will happen in the future when larger storms come. ''We have a 100-year flood every two years now,'' Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, and though he later claimed to be exaggerating, he's not exaggerating by much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future, once an amorphous, distant plain, is rapidly articulating itself. Ever since J. G. Ballard's ''Drowned World'' (1962), if not earlier, novelists have been imagining how we will live in an age of environmental ruin. In Kim Stanley Robinson's ''Red Mars'' (1993), a scarcity of natural resources leads to world war; in ''A Friend of the Earth'' (2000), T. Coraghessan Boyle describes a future in which the biosphere has collapsed, most mammals are extinct and Brazil is a desert. Dystopian novels about environmental apocalypses tend to contain a warning: this is the hell we will inherit if we don't change our behavior, quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that view is obsolete. We already know it's too late to reverse the planet's transformation, and we know what is going to happen next -- namely more of the same, just worse: superstorms, super-droughts, super-pandemics, massive population displacement, water scarcity, desertification and all the rest. The grim details can be found in any of the hundreds of nonfiction polemics published on the subject every year, books with titles like ''Overheated'' and ''Hot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E. M. Forster, in his 1909 dystopian short story ''The Machine Stops,'' anticipated the Internet and its sovereignty over our minds; Jules Verne foresaw the Apollo space program with an uncanny degree of precision; and Mark Twain, in a story called ''From The London Times of 1904,'' invented a device called the telelectroscope, which is essentially Skype. But today, perhaps for the first time in history, our scientists' predictions have outpaced the creative powers of our novelists. Even as a form, the dystopian novel seems quaint -- our worst fears are already upon us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, a truly dystopian work of fiction cannot rely on fantasy, but must instead engage more scrupulously with reality. This is one reason Ian McEwan's ''Solar,'' one of the few recent novels that speak eloquently, and with the appropriate sense of absurdity, about man's efforts to reverse climate change, is set in the present and recent past. The reality is worse than anyone has imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for novelists is coming from another flank. Nonfiction writers, borrowing freely from the novelist's bag of tricks but often with greater dexterity, seem better equipped to write about environmental collapse. Timothy Egan's ''Worst Hard Time,'' a historical account of the Dust Bowl, reads like a thriller, and predicts that even harder times will come soon. Ron Rosenbaum's ''How the End Begins'' has the force of an apocalyptic horror novel -- only everything in it is real. The best example in recent years is ''The World Without Us,'' by Alan Weisman, a work of speculative fiction disguised as a scientific study, which imagines what would happen to the planet should human beings suddenly vanish. The answer: Earth would be just fine. The globe, after all, has seen worse. It's the globe's human population that's in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the poor novelist to do about all this, if anything? His concern, as Saul Bellow put it, is ''man's heart,'' and he is not necessarily adept at stochastic models, Poisson curves or quantile regression charts. Just as elected politicians are generally ill-suited to respond to long-term, slow-to-develop global crises, novelists tend to be ill-suited to address complex scientific phenomena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the novelist has no obligation to write about climate change. But hasn't man's heart changed too? It's true every generation believes it's the last, a convenient sentiment that gives urgency and meaning to our brief time on earth. It is safe to say, however, that there has never been a generation in the history of human civilization with more access to bad news than ours. And the news is not all climate-related. The latest issues of periodicals like Emerging Infectious Diseases, Food Safety Magazine and the International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism are just a few keystrokes away, as are maps of the world's remaining nuclear warheads, the F.B.I.'s list of most wanted fugitives and the latest seismic data about the Yellowstone supervolcano. (If you don't know about the Yellowstone supervolcano, just <span class="companylink">Google</span> ''Yellowstone supervolcano human extinction.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know that certain milestones -- the collapse of the euro, peak oil and a megathrust earthquake that demolishes Seattle -- will come to pass. We just don't know when. There is a huge volcano on La Palma, one of the Canary Islands; scientists claim that the next time it erupts, half a trillion tons of rock will slide into the ocean, triggering the largest tsunami in recorded history, one that will make landfall, eight hours later, on the Atlantic Seaboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you're not the kind of person who compulsively searches ''mad cow outbreak'' or subscribes to the National Weather Service's ''Active Alerts,'' the bad news is unrelenting. No Ebola flare-up or near-miss asteroid goes unpublicized. The Internet echoes the information until it suffocates everything else. In ''Future Shock,'' published more than 40 years ago, Alvin Toffler described this condition as ''information overload.'' We're information-saturated, and most of the information is ominous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novelists may be powerless to change this terrifying new world, but they can make a greater effort to understand how it is changing us. Isn't this, after all, why we read novels -- to see ourselves more clearly? A great novel holds a mirror to our secret desires and fears; it allows us to confront our long-term crises. It helps us to understand how the vast, complex problems of our time connect with our private inner lives. Novelists therefore have an obligation to pose the intimate questions: How does all this bad news affect our relationships with our loved ones, our hopes for the future, the way we go about our daily lives? Do we ignore it, turn cynical, or become overwhelmed by dread? What is all this information doing to our minds? What is it doing to our hearts?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AND now for some counterprogramming. You probably missed it, what with the Boston Marathon bombing, the ricin-laced letters, the fertilizer plant explosion and an entire city locked down while cops hunted the bombing suspect, but we discovered another world last week. Two, actually -- both somewhat larger than Earth, circling a star with the sadly unromantic name of Kepler 62, 1,200 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These planets are not the first Earth-like bodies astronomers have discovered, but their size and position make them particularly promising candidates to have liquid water -- and with it, perhaps, some form of life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their promise only adds to a mystery that's been building the further our probes and telescopes have pushed into the unknown. If Earth-like planets are relatively common, as scientists increasingly believe, then where are all the Earth-like civilizations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mystery is known as the Fermi paradox, after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who raised it at lunch with fellow scientists in 1950. He pointed out that our Sun is a relatively young star, and billions of other suns are billions of years older. If even a tiny fraction of those suns have planets like ours, and even a tiny fraction of those planets developed life, and even a tiny fraction of those life forms achieved human-level intelligence ... well, the number of civilizations capable of interstellar communication and travel should be theoretically large enough to crowd our galaxy with signals, ships, artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In which case, Fermi asked, Where is everybody?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential answers to this question can feel as numberless as the stars themselves. (The Wikipedia entry on the Fermi paradox runs to just over 10,000 words.) But two seem particularly plausible. Perhaps life and consciousness are rare enough, mysterious enough, impossible enough, that even multiplying Earth-like worlds a billion times over would not necessarily produce either one again. Or alternatively, perhaps the gulfs between the stars are just too wide to bridge, and our current limited attempts at exploration are as far as any creatures of flesh and blood can ever hope to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first possibility obviously raises theological as well as scientific questions. In one sense, it elevates humanity, restoring us to an almost pre-Copernican position in the cosmos. At the same time, though, plenty of religious believers are untroubled (or even inspired) by the idea of extraterrestrial life, while the possibility that the cosmos might be as empty as it is vast raises troubling questions about what, exactly, its Designer had in mind. (''The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread,'' wrote the great Christian philosopher Blaise Pascal.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, an optimistic believer might venture, the cosmos only seems empty because we haven't fulfilled our destiny and populated it. But here the second possible answer to Fermi's paradox intervenes: What if it can't be populated at all? What if our own solar system is as far as we'll ever get?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously that's not a question we're presently equipped to answer, after less than 60 years of spaceflight. But it haunts our era in subtle, unacknowledged ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a sense in which Frederick Jackson Turner's 1893 argument about how the idea of the frontier shaped American history can apply to the entire modern project. Exploration, expansion, the promise that a better life was just a long voyage away -- all of these helped fuel the sense of historical mission, the assumption of perpetual progress, which shaped and defined the modern age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go back and read the science fiction of the 1940s and '50s, and you'll be struck by the vaulting confidence that this expansion would continue upward and outward, and that a new age of exploration was just waiting to be born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today that confidence has vanished. Our Mars rovers are impressive and our billionaires keep pouring money into private spaceflight, but neither project captures the public's imagination, and the very term ''Space Age'' seems antique. The Kepler 62 discovery might have earned more headlines at a less horrific moment, but it would have fallen out of the news soon enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible that we're less interested in space travel because we feel that it's a luxury good at a time when we have bigger problems here on Earth. But it's also possible that we've gradually turned inward, to our smartphone screens and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> profiles, because we know that spaceflight isn't going to get us to another world anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously exploration is not a cure for unhappiness or evil. But it can be an antidote to the mix of anxiety and exhaustion that seems to permeate the developed world these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after a week as grimly claustrophobic as this one, with its spasms of nihilistic violence, its frantic online rumor mill, its locked-down Boston streets, it seems worth hoping that the human desire for wider horizons -- for new worlds to wonder at, reach for and understand -- will someday be fulfilled again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to get to work on that warp drive.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Thursday that they had found the most Earth-like worlds yet known in the outer cosmos, a pair of planets that appear capable of supporting life and that orbit a star 1,200 light-years from here, in the northern constellation Lyra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the two outermost of five worlds circling a yellowish star slightly smaller and dimmer than our Sun, heretofore anonymous and now destined to be known in the cosmic history books as Kepler 62, after NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which discovered them. These planets are roughly half again as large as Earth and are presumably balls of rock, perhaps covered by oceans with humid, cloudy skies, although that is at best a highly educated guess.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody will probably ever know if anything lives on these planets, and the odds are that humans will travel there only in their faster-than-light dreams, but the news has sent astronomers into heavenly raptures. William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Center, head of the Kepler project, described one of the new worlds as the best site for Life Out There yet found in Kepler's four-years-and-counting search for other Earths. He treated his team to pizza and beer on his own dime to celebrate the find (this being the age of sequestration). ''It's a big deal,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looming brightly in each other's skies, the two planets circle their star at distances of 37 million and 65 million miles, about as far apart as Mercury and Venus in our solar system. Most significantly, their orbits place them both in the ''Goldilocks'' zone of lukewarm temperatures suitable for liquid water, the crucial ingredient for Life as We Know It.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldilocks would be so jealous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous claims of Goldilocks planets with ''just so'' orbits snuggled up to red dwarf stars much dimmer and cooler than the Sun have had uncertainties in the size and mass and even the existence of these worlds, said David Charbonneau of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, an exoplanet hunter and member of the Kepler team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the first planet that ticks both boxes,'' Dr. Charbonneau said, speaking of the outermost planet, Kepler 62f. ''It's the right size and the right temperature.'' Kepler 62f is 40 percent bigger than Earth and smack in the middle of the habitable zone, with a 267-day year. In an interview, Mr. Borucki called it the best planet Kepler has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its mate, known as Kepler 62e, is slightly larger -- 60 percent bigger than Earth -- and has a 122-day orbit, placing it on the inner edge of the Goldilocks zone. It is warmer but also probably habitable, astronomers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler 62 system resembles our own solar system, which also has two planets in the habitable zone: Earth -- and Mars, which once had water and would still be habitable today if it were more massive and had been able to hang onto its primordial atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler 62 planets continue a string of breakthroughs in the last two decades in which astronomers have gone from detecting the first known planets belonging to other stars, or exoplanets, broiling globs of gas bigger than Jupiter, to being able to discern smaller and smaller more moderate orbs -- iceballs like Neptune and, now, bodies only a few times the mass of Earth, known technically as super-Earths. Size matters in planetary affairs because we can't live under the crushing pressure of gas clouds on a world like Jupiter. Life as We Know It requires solid ground and liquid water -- a gentle terrestrial environment, in other words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 62's newfound worlds are not quite small enough to be considered strict replicas of Earth, but the results have strengthened the already strong conviction among astronomers that the galaxy is littered with billions of Earth-size planets, perhaps as many as one per star, and that astronomers will soon find Earth 2.0, as they call it -- our lost twin bathing in the rays of an alien sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kepler and other experiments are finding planets that remind us more and more of home,'' said Geoffrey Marcy, a longtime exoplanet hunter at the University of California, Berkeley, and Kepler team member. ''It's an amazing moment in science. We haven't found Earth 2.0 yet, but we can taste it, smell it, right there on our technological fingertips.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of 60 authors, led by Mr. Borucki, reported the discovery of the Kepler 62 planets on Thursday in an article published online in the journal Science and at a news conference at Ames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if that weren't enough, a group led by Thomas Barclay of Ames and the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute also reported the discovery of a planet 1.7 times as big as Earth hovering on the inner, warmer edge of the Goldilocks zone of Kepler 69, a star almost identical to the Sun, 2,700 light-years distant. At the news conference, Dr. Barclay described the planet as perhaps a ''Super-Venus.'' The group's paper was published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in another paper submitted to The Astrophysical Journal, a group led by Lisa Kaltenegger of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, in Heidelberg, Germany, took the first stab at trying to model conditions on the Kepler 62 planets. That is a tough job because the system is too far away for astronomers to measure the masses of these planets, which would allow the densities and compositions of the planets to be pinned down, or to inspect and analyze their atmospheres with telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scaling up from the properties of the Earth, Dr. Kaltenegger and her colleagues concluded that both of them were probably ocean worlds with humid, cloudy skies. Any life on them would probably be aquatic, she said, but ''it might even be cooler life than we have here. Looking at the oceans, we find a lot of interesting life-forms there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kaltenegger said she envisioned the pair as a kind of Darwinian test tube and wondered in an e-mail if life would evolve on both worlds and, if so, ''Would life evolve 'the same' way or would there be very different life?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is huge for the overall life-elsewhere question,'' said Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not part of the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Boss, a planetary expert at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution of Washington</span> and a member of the Kepler team, called the new results the capstone of the Kepler mission. ''I would argue,'' he said in an e-mail, ''that if this was all that we learned from Kepler, that the cost of this mission was justified.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in March 2009, hunts planets by staring at 150,000 stars in a patch of Milky Way sky, monitoring their brightnesses and looking for blips caused when planets pass in front of their home stars. To date the spacecraft has identified 115 planets and has a list of 2,740 other candidates. (Over all, the world's astronomers now know of almost 1,000 exoplanets.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler, which had its mission extended for four years last spring, is only now coming into its prime. A minimum of three blips is required to register a planet, and so planets like the Earth that take a year to make an orbit are only now coming into view in the Kepler data. Indeed, the new Kepler 62 planets each registered just three transits, as they are called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a hitch, Dr. Seager and others cautioned. Because the Kepler stars are all so far away -- hundreds or thousands of light-years -- and the planets we want to find are so small, astronomers will never be quite completely sure what any particular planet is made of or whether anything can or does live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Kepler 62, said Natalie Batalha of <span class="companylink">San Jose State University</span>, a Kepler scientist, the astronomers had determined the composition of the new planets by comparison to three earlier objects that had similar sizes and turned out to be rocky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mass by association,'' Dr. Batalha called it in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is fine if all you want is the statistics of the cosmos. As Dr. Seager pointed out, ''Kepler was not designed to tell us which planet to go live on, only how common Earth-like planets are.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, teenagers and millennials do conform to some of their stereotypes. On <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, ''younger persons talk more about themselves and use more chat language such as haha, XD,'' the researchers wrote, ''while older people use more conventional words indicating support or wishing well (e.g. wish, enjoy, thanks, take care).'' For those of you over 30: XD is a synonym for LOL; it represents a laughing face shown sideways. (I had to look it up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What good is such research? According to the study, which was written up by New Scientist, a computer program that can automatically predict people's ages ''could also be used to improve targeting of advertisements and to support fine-grained analysis of trends on the Web.'' Just what the world needs: more grist for marketers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rain on Saturn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there any third grader whose favorite planet isn't Saturn? Those rings are not only fun when making models for the science fair, but also a meaningful source of water falling to the planet's surface -- a phenomenon that scientists refer to as ''ring rain.'' ''Saturn is the first planet to show significant interaction between its atmosphere and ring system,'' said James O'Donoghue of the <span class="companylink">University of Leicester</span> in England, the lead author of an article in Nature about the water falling on Saturn. Through telescope work at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the researchers confirmed that the dark bands on Saturn come from charged water particles that influence the composition and temperature of parts of its upper atmosphere. ''The main effect of ring rain is that it acts to 'quench' the ionosphere of Saturn, severely reducing the electron densities in regions in which it falls,'' Mr. O'Donoghue said in a news release. To Space.com, he put it a more user-friendly way: ''We estimate that one Olympic-sized swimming pool of water is falling on Saturn per day.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day, it seems, global warming finds a new way to discomfit us. Researchers recently reported that rising levels of carbon dioxide could lead to more turbulence on trans-Atlantic flights . Now comes a new report that vast swaths of wine country may soon grow too warm to nurture those perfect grapes. A paper in the Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> predicted the decline of wine production in the Bordeaux and Rhone regions in France and Tuscany in Italy and noted, in scientific deadpan, that demand for wine would be likely to increase as the global population gains affluence. The good news? ''Large newly suitable areas are projected in regions of Northern Europe and western North America,'' the paper said. Or as a report in The Guardian put it, ''Bid adieu to Bordeaux, but also, quite possibly, a hello to Chateau Yellowstone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fauna</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behold: The Striped Bat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is striped like a zebra, black and white, and would fit neatly in the palm of your hand (though you might want to wear gloves). She is a new genus of bat, described in a paper in Zookeys, that was found in the Bangangai Game Preserve in South Sudan last July. At first, the bat-collecting researchers thought the unusual specimen in their net was an example of Glauconycteris, a ''poorly known bat,'' as they put it, that is also ''poorly represented in museum collections.'' (A similar-looking bat had been reported in 1939 by a researcher named Hayman working in the Belgian Congo, who had called it ''one of the most striking discoveries of recent years.'') But further analysis of the new striped bat showed that she belonged to a separate genus, by virtue of her odd appearance and the fact that ''the bat's anatomy was also distinct, featuring a larger skull, differently shaped ears, bigger teeth and longer wingtips,'' according to Wired, which compared it to ''a tiny flying bulldog.'' Her genus has been named Niumbaha, which means ''rare'' in the language of a local tribe in South Sudan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clear Brains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take this literally, not metaphorically: scientists have found a method for making brains transparent -- the tissue, that is -- which will help them study systems within a cadaver's brain without having to cut it up. The process, called Clarity, ''preserves the biochemistry of the brain so well that researchers can test it over and over again with chemicals that highlight specific structures and provide clues to past activity,'' The New York Times reported on Thursday. ''The researchers say this process may help uncover the physical underpinnings of devastating mental disorders like schizophrenia, autism, post-traumatic stress disorder and others.'' So far, the researchers, from Stanford, have been able to peer inside a whole mouse brain and part of a human brain and to highlight various networks of neurons in fluorescent colors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter is thought to exist copiously throughout the universe, serving as the gravitational glue that holds galaxies and other heavenly things together. But so far it has existed only in theory: no one has actually seen it. Last week some physicists claimed they were getting close. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a spectacular machine on the International Space Station that was lovingly crafted by the Nobel laureate Samuel Ting of M.I.T., confirmed earlier reports of excessive numbers of antimatter particles that could be coming from collisions of dark matter or other ''new physical phenomena.''

The melting, which appears to be a manifestation of global warming, has exposed plants that were buried by the ice when the glacier overran them about 6,300 years ago. ''If any time in the last 6,000 years these plants had been exposed for any five-year period, they would have decayed,'' said the lead glaciologist, Lonnie G. Thompson of Ohio State University.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dark side of the universe is whispering, but scientists are still not sure what it is saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel Ting, a professor at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and a Nobel laureate particle physicist, said Wednesday that his $1.6 billion cosmic ray experiment on the International Space Station had found evidence of ''new physical phenomena'' that could represent dark matter, the mysterious stuff that serves as the gravitational foundation for galaxies and whose identification would rewrite some of the laws of physics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, he said, confirmed previous reports that local interstellar space is crackling with an unexplained abundance of high energy particles, especially positrons, the antimatter version of the familiar electrons that comprise electricity and chemistry. They could be colliding particles of dark matter. Or they could be could be coming from previously undiscovered pulsars or other astronomical monsters, throwing off wild winds of radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tantalizing news is that even with the new data, physicists cannot tell yet which is the right answer, but they are encouraged that they soon might be able to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it makes you believe it must be dark matter, nor do I think it makes you believe it cannot be,'' said Neal Weiner, a particle theorist at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, as Dr. Ting's instrument is called, is only two years into what could be a 20-year voyage on the space station, and is working brilliantly. ''Over the coming months, A.M.S. will be able to tell us conclusively whether these positrons are a signal for dark matter, or whether they have some other origin,'' Dr. Ting told an audience of physicists at CERN, the <span class="companylink">European Organization for Nuclear Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report will be published in Physical Review Letters on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers and others from outside the collaboration responded enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A.M.S. has confirmed with exquisite precision and to high energy one of the most exciting mysteries in astrophysics and particle physics,'' said Justin Vandenbroucke of the University of Wisconsin and Stanford's SLAC laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Spiropulu, a Caltech particle physicist, said, ''They have exquisitely small errors and they stop the plot at the cliffhanger, so we will be asking for more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, like Gregory Tarle of the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>, cautioned that uncertainties in the galactic background of radiation might make it impossible to ever get a clean answer to the source of the positrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter has teased and obsessed astronomers since the 1930s, when the Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky deduced that some invisible ''missing mass'' was required to supply the gravitational glue to hold clusters of galaxies together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to recent measurements by the Planck spacecraft, about 27 percent of the universe, by mass, is composed of some unknown form of matter unlike the atoms that make up us and everything we can see. Astronomers cannot see it, but they can detect its gravitational tug pulling the galaxies and stars around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out what this stuff is is important for more than cosmology. The most favored candidates for its identity are as yet undiscovered particles known as WIMPs -- weakly interacting massive particles -- left over from the Big Bang. Such particles could drift through the Earth like wind through a screen door. Impervious to almost everything except gravity, they would form a shadow universe clumping together into invisible clouds that then attract ordinary matter. Discovering one of them could give a lift to new theories of physics, like supersymmetry, which predicts of a whole new spectrum of so-called superpartners to the particles we already know about, not to mention explicating the nature of more than a quarter of creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until now, the dark matter particles have mostly eluded direct detection in the laboratory or creation at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sky could be a different story. Such WIMPs floating in the halos around galaxies would occasionally collide and annihilate one another in tiny fireballs of radiation and lighter particles, the theorists Michael Turner of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> and Frank Wilczek of M.I.T. suggested in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is one of the most expensive, complicated and controversial experiments ever mounted in space. Built by an army of 600 scientists from 16 countries, including Italy, Germany, Russia, China and Taiwan, it took 16 years from its approval in 1995 by NASA's administrator at the time, Dan Goldin, to get to space, on the next-to-last shuttle flight, in May 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then there were already intimations of dark matter in the heavens. Pamela, a satellite built by Italian, German, Russian and Swedish scientists, registered an excess of anti-electrons, or positrons, in space -- perhaps, they said, from collisions of dark matter particles. Using data from the Fermi satellite, researchers at Stanford were also able to detect a similar excess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting said his spectrometer had validated those observations with more detail and much better statistics. Among other things, as best the A.M.S. team can tell, the positrons are coming equally from all directions -- a result that would favor dark matter, which should be spread evenly through the galaxy, rather than pulsars, which would be localized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of the experiments has yet observed what Dr. Turner called the smoking gun of dark matter. If the signal is coming from colliding WIMPs, the theory says, the ratio of positrons to electrons will rise as the energy of the positrons and electrons rises, flattens and then drops sharply. The cutoff energy represents the mass-energy of the putative dark matter particle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of pulsars, the fraction of positrons would drop much more slowly and gradually, physicists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station spectrometer can record particles with energies as high as a trillion electron volts, Dr. Ting said, and indeed in his talk he showed individual events with positrons and electrons having energies of some 600 billion electron volts. But the data presented Wednesday ranges in energy only from a few million to 350 billion electron volts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That data is summarized in a plot that shows the ratio of positrons to electrons rising rapidly and then ever more slowly as the energy increases. The plot runs out of data, Dr. Turner noted, just where the telltale drop should start taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At CERN, Dr. Ting declined to answer questions or speculate about what happened in the empty spot at higher energies on his graph, or even when he would know. ''Slowly,'' he answered when asked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are among the many things that last longer than a total solar eclipse.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So taking a 37-hour journey from my home in Pennsylvania to north Queensland, Australia, to view such a fleeting event may not seem like a natural vacation, especially not with your family in tow. But the promise of a prime viewing spot was all it took for me, an astronomy enthusiast, to book a trip last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would be joining the legions of people you could call astrotourists, who, undaunted by the prospect of a cloudy day, travel extraordinary distances for the opportunity to glimpse the latest ex-orbital phenomena. Sure, a meteor streaking across the sky is flashy, especially when it's not expected, but to us, seeing a total solar eclipse is the holy grail, an experience so priceless you wouldn't hesitate to subject yourself and your wife and your young daughters to the time and expense of a 12,000-mile trip to see one. (What's 12,000 miles when you consider the 200,000-odd miles between the Earth and the Moon?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd dreamed of what it must be like to witness an eclipse for years. I'd marveled at images of them. And I knew, from the hours spent gazing through my telescopes at star clusters, galaxies and planets, that firsthand astronomical observations always trumped photos in books or on computer screens. It becomes an experience -- eyepiece views of Saturn and Jupiter are imprinted in my memory in ways Hubble pictures are not. Eclipses, I had heard, were in yet another league. They feel close, powerful. They turn day to night, and reveal our star's complex, gauzy atmosphere in the space of minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really is an amazing visual experience that can become a life-changer for some people,'' said Paul Maley, a retired NASA engineer who organizes eclipse trips with Ring of Fire Expeditions, one of dozens of operators that cater to astrotourists. ''People get different things out of it, and even after seeing more than 40 eclipses, I'm still surprised by how people react. One guy on a trip to Indonesia was so freaked out he hyperventilated. We had to get him a paper bag.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though I hoped it wouldn't come to that for my daughters, Lucy, 11, and Alice, 8, or my wife, Kimberly, I did want us to share a life-altering experience. This particular one was visible only in far north Queensland. And if the eclipse was a bust, there was a fail-safe: we would be within easy distance of the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian Outback and lush rain forests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We arrived at our destination, Port Douglas, a resort town an hour north of Cairns, a few days before the eclipse. It was sunny and warm. We checked in to our boutique hotel -- the Apartments at the White House -- and passed time splashing in the waters of Four Mile Beach a block away, strolling a strip of upscale restaurants and stores that made up the downtown, and exploring nearby Daintree Rain Forest in our rental car. In the evenings, we walked along the beach. The town, then in the off-season, buzzed as it would amid an Australian summer. Thousands of eclipse-chasers had flooded Port Douglas -- among more than 50,000 that came to northern Queensland for the event. (Maley's tour group stayed in Cairns.) The coming eclipse dominated local chatter online, on the air and on the streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day before the eclipse, however, any sense of relaxation I felt vanished when I walked out to the beach before dawn. The horizon above the Coral Sea was filled with puffy clouds. I wasn't alone in my worry. Dozens of other chasers who had come from Asia, the Middle East, the United States, Europe and other points in Australia scanned the sky. Many had no backup plans. Because rental cars were scarce, Port Douglas was their only option. I suddenly felt extremely grateful that I had reserved a car six months in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same day, jet-lag and fatigue caught up with everyone in my family at once, and we spent much of the day in irritable funks. Late afternoon brought more rain than sun, and I had to decide: Should we stick it out with most of the crowd in town and hope for a break in the clouds, or shoot inland to try to find clear skies someplace where coastal weather patterns weren't a factor? That would mean forcing my cranky crew to sleep in our rental car in the Australian Outback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I sensed we had to do it, and Kimberly and the girls gamely agreed. Without a peep of protest, we packed pillows, blankets and snacks into the car and set out for Mareeba, a town about an hour west of Cairns. A local newscaster had tweeted that town as a good Plan B. It's high in the Atherton Tablelands, and famed for its nearly year-round sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We drove in darkness and rain along slow, twisting roads, arriving in Mareeba before midnight. As we prowled the countryside looking for a reasonably secure place to park, we spotted other cars and vans filled with people also camped by the side of the road. A herd of kangaroos -- our first in-the-wild spotting -- bounded from the woods and across our headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We settled on an empty park. I thought the girls had fallen asleep until I heard a drowsy exclamation from Lucy: ''Look at the sky!'' We got out. It was crystal clear, and thanks to the lack of light pollution, the inky black sky was studded with thousands of bright stars. We spotted a slew of targets that you can't see in the Northern Hemisphere: the Southern Cross, multiple spectacular star clusters, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds -- two enormous galaxies that look like clouds hanging in the air. It was a stunning interlude before a few hours of rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At dawn, we went to a coffee plantation called Skybury, which had a virtually cloudless, blue-sky view nearly all the way to the coast. A crowd had gathered there, and the staff was brewing coffee. I set up a compact five-inch aperture Celestron telescope and a dedicated solar scope, the latter of which is the only way to view the progression of the eclipse before the moon completely obscures the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show started around 6:30. A modest bite on the left of the sun grew, turning it into a deep crescent. As the sun was shrinking to a sliver, the air grew cooler and the terrain took on a darker hue. Shadows became strangely acute, as the dimmed overhead light focused more intensely than the dimmed angled light of sunrise or sunset. We saw hot-air balloons in the valley below us. Someone nearby pointed up and shouted ''Venus!'' The planet shone brightly as we rotated into the Moon's shadow. Other stars emerged, no longer outshone by the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the sun swiftly became a mere pinprick before the moon completely -- and perfectly -- blotted it out. A bright halo, shimmering and alive, was the only indication of its existence. It grew dark, and the birds around us hushed. People gasped. I looked at Kimberly and the girls on their blanket; they sat there watching, their mouths hanging open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realized how inadequate all the photos I've seen of an eclipse are. They lack context -- the sky, the ground, the bits of brightness visible around the edge of the sun's shadow at the horizon. Many people say they feel small and insignificant when observing the universe in all its vastness. But I felt connected to the cosmos, part of a perfect machine. I stood squarely in the shadow of the Moon, marveling at the watchwork synchrony, the strangeness and the singular cosmic coincidence that had brought me there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Totality -- the time that the sun is completely blocked -- lasted for nearly two minutes, and seemed to end as quickly as it began. The sun re-emerged, first as a bright dot on the edge of the halo that gave the illusion of a diamond ring. Sunlight fell back on us; the birds resumed chirping. Everyone breathed loudly and applauded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EYES ON THE HEAVENS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenya A major total solar eclipse will cross the African continent Nov. 3, with Kenya being the optimal viewing point. It will be a rare hybrid eclipse, which means some people will see a total eclipse while others will see a partial one. Totality will be brief -- only 15 seconds -- but you'll be able to fold in plenty of other adventures while in Kenya. Sky &amp; Telescope magazine (skyandtelescope.com) is sponsoring a weeklong tour at $5,695 for a double and $6,389 for single occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic Ocean To see a full minute of the total eclipse in November, consider a 10-day cruise with Ring of Fire Expeditions (eclipsetours.com), priced from $4,469 to $13,499. It starts in Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, catches the eclipse in the Atlantic Ocean, then continues to Barbados.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desert near La Serena, Chile This is a dark-sky site, far away from the light pollution from urban and suburban locations that can wipe out the Milky Way and make most nebula, galaxies and star clusters impossible to see. It is also home to a hotel called Elqui Domos (elquidomos.cl), which has telescopes on hand and domed rooms with views of the night sky.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MELBOURNE, Fla. -- The day after the shuttle Atlantis landed for the last time at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011, Angel Telles, a man with three master's degrees, scooped up his white Mission 101 coffee mug and drove away from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> after 24 years on the job there. The shuttle era had ended, and with it the jobs of 8,000 <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and civilian workers who found themselves unemployed in the midst of a harsh economic downturn and a crush of home foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So great was the blow to the state and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s traditional space program that it put politicians, including presidential candidates, on the defensive on the campaign trail.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I mean, it was happening before our very eyeballs,'' said Mr. Telles, 50, whose most recent job at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was developing requirements for new vehicles, as he recalled his last day at the space center. ''This is happening to me? Really? You are in shock.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But then,'' he added, ''you say, 'I am moving on.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did, and finally, this month, Mr. Telles landed a well-paying engineering job with the <span class="companylink">Harris Corporation</span>, an international telecommunications equipment company. His hiring is the latest sign that nearly two years after Brevard County was left staggering from the one-two punch of the downturn and the demise of the shuttle program, the Space Coast, while still struggling, has defied the bleak predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private employers on the Space Coast, which includes Cocoa Beach and Merritt Island, have created more than 4,000 jobs since 2010 and have added 1,000 more this year, including jobs in aerospace, aviation, engineering and other high-technology sectors. Companies like Embraer, which makes jets, <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> and Rocket Crafters were among those that moved here or expanded. Small businesses are also opening at a faster clip. Housing prices are rising, and the pace of foreclosures is slowing in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The linchpin in Brevard's recovery was a plan to diversify beyond aerospace while maintaining its astronaut aura and capitalizing on its coveted labor force: well-trained, highly educated workers with security clearance who have demonstrated the ability to launch manned spacecraft into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone said we were going to get hit by a Category 5 storm -- board up and get ready,'' said Robin Fisher, a Brevard County commissioner from Titusville, which has been slower to recover than the rest of the county. ''After the national program shut down, there were a lot of reasons to fail. But we didn't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future after Atlantis was in many ways guided by the lessons of Apollo. More than four decades ago, this county was built on the gold rush that resulted from the Apollo program, back when astronauts were household names and Cocoa Beach was familiar to television viewers as the home of ''I Dream of Jeannie.'' But in 1972, President Richard M. Nixon shut down the program, decimating the communities surrounding the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 18,000 jobs were lost in 18 months. Some residents walked away from their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cancellation of Apollo was much more abrupt, and it was a lot bigger,'' said Dale Ketcham, who is in charge of strategic alliances for Space Florida, the state's port authority for space and its economic development engine. He grew up in Cocoa Beach and was headed to college at that time. ''The economy was much less robust and diversified, so there really wasn't anything else to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, local and state officials had years to plan for the end of the shuttle program, which was announced by President George W. Bush in 2004, after the Columbia shuttle disintegrated on re-entry. A scaled-down program called Constellation was begun, but that was canceled by President Obama after it, too, became expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the setbacks, Brevard kept one important project: the building of Orion, a multipurpose deep-space capsule. It was the first time the Kennedy Space Center moved from launching a craft to assembling one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months after the shuttle program closed, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> stepped in, announcing it would establish a headquarters at the space center for its new spaceship program to fly astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The program would create 550 jobs by 2015, a relatively small number, but one welcomed nonetheless by local and state officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger challenge was drafting a plan to diversify beyond the traditional parameters of government-run deep-space programs and finding a way to recoup the 8,000 lost jobs little by little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the past three years, more companies have started to roll into Brevard. They have been enticed, in part, by government tax incentives sprinkled liberally across Florida to court business, a practice that has drawn some criticism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem in the past is that there was no plan of action,'' said Lynda Weatherman, the president of the Space Coast's Economic Development Commission. ''It's as much a psychological promotion story as an economic one. It said there is a Chapter 2 in our lives. Part of the reason we got into this situation is because all we did was launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she cautioned, ''We are not out of the woods yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside a state-of-the-art hangar at the Melbourne Airport, Embraer's sleek executive 10-seater jets are being assembled, outfitted and painted. Embraer, a Brazilian company that was voted a top firm to work for in the state by Florida Trend magazine, was courted by 20 states. It moved to Melbourne, a turning point for the area, and opened in February 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason Embraer chose Melbourne was that it wanted the first chance at hiring laid-off shuttle workers. Forty of the employees working on its jets are former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> contractors. Others came from an Air Force base nearby. Embraer recently announced it is building an engineering center here, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew there would be very qualified people that would be valuable to us,'' said Gary Spulak, the president of Embraer Aircraft Holdings. He added that many of the workers already had experience with aircraft like Cessna, Piper and Gulfstream: ''They were all using processes we hold in high regard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has also seen an infusion of companies involved in suborbital spaceflight, like Rocket Crafters and Xcor Aerospace. Last month, Northrup said it planned to add 920 jobs to its aviation operation in the county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, recovery is far from assured. The unemployment rate in Brevard was 8 percent in February, higher than Florida's average and the country's over all. About half of the laid-off shuttle workers have founds jobs here or somewhere else. The rest retired, moved away or were still looking for work, according to Lisa Rice, the president of Brevard Workforce, which helps them find jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severance packages will soon run out for some, raising new concerns. Underemployment is another worry. Disparities have become more pronounced; recovery has been swifter in the southern part of the county, where Melbourne is located. In Titusville, farther north, empty storefronts and houses sit forlorn. Yet there are subtle signs of recovery: An arts movement is budding, and the town's biggest mall is being redeveloped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The county has been split in two,'' Mr. Telles lamented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he did what he could to market himself. He went back to school for an undergraduate degree in engineering.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DECADE AGO, the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> paid $10 million to acquire the only known original copy of a 1507 world map that has been called ''the birth certificate of America.'' The large map, a masterpiece of woodblock printing, has been a star attraction at the library ever since and the object of revived scholarly fascination about the earliest cartography of the New World. The research has also rescued from obscurity a little-known Renaissance man, the 16th-century globe maker Johannes Schöner, who was responsible for saving the map for posterity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We call ourselves Americans today because of the map's makers, Martin Waldseemüller and Mathias Ringmann, young clerics in the cathedral village of St.-Dié, France. By incorporating early New World discoveries, their map reached beyond the canonical descriptions of Old World geography handed down from Ptolemy in the second century. On a lower stretch of the southern continent, the mapmakers inscribed the name ''America'' in the mistaken belief that Amerigo Vespucci, not Columbus, deserved credit for first sighting a part of that continent, South America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or possibly they favored Vespucci because he held more firmly to the growing consensus that this was indeed a New World, not the Indies (as Columbus so wanted to believe), and because he wrote more colorfully than Columbus about the people he encountered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The map is also the source of an abiding mystery. How did Waldseemüller and Ringmann already know so well the configuration of South America, before any recorded Spanish or Portuguese voyages around the horn to the west coast? How did they know of the Pacific before Balboa made his sighting in 1513? Hard to believe it was just a guess or futuristic vision of what world geography would come to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were the cartographers themselves dropping a hint when they wrote on the map that ''if you are not familiar with the new discoveries, do not be afraid of what it is you see on this map, for it is how you will come to see your world in the future''?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, John W. Hessler, a historian of cartography at the library, published ''The Naming of America,'' an account of the map's importance in post-Ptolemy geography, its disappearance for centuries and its rediscovery in a castle near the Black Forest in southwestern Germany. Now, Dr. Hessler has dug deeper into the dynamic of the years between Columbus, in 1492, and Copernicus, in 1543. Science and exploration were stretching minds to distant horizons, once unknown. Copernican astronomy was about to dislodge Earth from the center of the universe, a start to the Scientific Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new book, ''A Renaissance Globemaker's Toolbox,'' is not able to solve the mapmakers' enduring mystery. But it is a richly illustrated delight to the eye. I advise a slow tour of the maps, drawings, marginal notes and other material remains of Schöner's wide-ranging mind. Read the informative captions, then begin the text.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General readers will find the accounts of Schöner's place in history and the preservation of the map lucid and fascinating. Parts of more technical chapters, like the instructions on making a terrestrial globe, appear to be written more for the author's academic peers than for many laypeople. And of necessity, this is hardly a flesh-and-blood biography, as the archives are largely silent about Schöner's personal life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do see a print of a bearded, heavyset man and read a brief diary entry about him as a young Catholic cleric with a relaxed view of celibacy: he entered into a relationship with a woman that produced three children. One can thus understand his conversion to Protestantism in Martin Luther's Reformation. That led him to the professorship in mathematics at Nuremberg, which he held to his death in 1547.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hessler leaned heavily on Schöner's personal archive of correspondence and manuscripts, books and maps, including corrections and comments in the margins. He was into everything in science: completing two world globes in his prime, drawing celestial maps and globes and preparing horoscopes, one even for a Hapsburg emperor. Not another Leonardo da Vinci, but who was?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rather than a producer of theories,'' Dr. Hessler observes, Schöner ''was instead a disseminator, a compiler and a transmitter of the new science and mathematics.'' Yes, something of a pack rat, but one with a sharp eye for what was likely to be of importance in the future. This attribute cast Schöner as savior of the 1507 world map. His practice was to gather and bind portfolios of his compiled materials. One of these, now called Schöner Sammelband (meaning ''gathering''), preserved the ''America'' map. There it passed from hand to hand, all the other original prints disappeared, and Schöner's was lost for more than 300 years. Most of the bound portfolios wound up in a Vienna library, but one languished in a German castle, unrecognized, until a Jesuit priest found it in 1901 -- thence to the United States in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing in the book points up more clearly Schöner's pivotal place in a world in transition from the medieval to the modern than his residual interest in astrology and his awakening curiosity when he apparently heard reports of a new theory being formulated by a Polish Catholic cleric. A brilliant young student of Schöner's, Georg Joachim Rheticus, went to see Copernicus in 1539 and learned more about the Earth orbiting the Sun. Rheticus then composed a short treatise, written in the form of a letter to his teacher, ''most illustrious and learned'' Johannes Schöner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The publication, widely circulated in Europe, was the first definitive account of the new Copernican system of the heavens.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an eclectic mix of crowd-sourced video, information from <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth and data from nuclear test-ban sensors, scientists have gotten a much more accurate picture of the small asteroid that exploded near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is most clear is that while Chelyabinsk did not exactly dodge a bullet on Feb. 15, the city was fortunate to be only grazed by it. ''The people of Chelyabinsk were very lucky,'' Edward Lu, a former astronaut who now leads the <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span>, a private initiative to detect similar asteroids, said at a Congressional hearing last week about the space threats.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian meteor -- which, according to the latest estimates, was about 60 feet in diameter and came in undetected at roughly 42,000 miles an hour -- was almost 15 miles high when it blew apart. There were no deaths, and most of the 1,500 injuries were from glass as windows shattered when a shock wave hit the city 88 seconds later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it had detonated closer to the ground, it would have been worse,'' said Margaret Campbell-Brown, a member of a team of researchers at the University of Western Ontario who have analyzed the meteor's orbit and characteristics of the blast. It also helped that the meteor was a stony one -- what scientists call an ordinary chondrite -- and not a rarer iron-nickel one, in which case it might have reached the ground before exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blast was the largest fireball since the Tunguska event of 1908, and as videos from surveillance, car-mounted and cellphone cameras quickly began to be posted online, it became apparent that this explosion would be studied like no other, with scientists and amateur bloggers alike rushing to analyze the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tunguska event involved the detonation of what is generally thought to be a meteor over a remote part of central Siberia. That object may have entered the atmosphere at a steeper angle than the Chelyabinsk meteor -- which came in at an angle of less than 20 degrees from horizontal -- and exploded about five miles above the ground. The lower altitude, as well as the larger size of the Tunguska rock, help explain why it had a much greater impact, flattening trees over an area the size of metropolitan Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Canadian team has calculated that the energy released in the Chelyabinsk explosion was the equivalent of about 440 kilotons of TNT, or about 30 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That calculation was made with the help of data from a network of acoustic sensors set up to monitor compliance with the treaty to ban nuclear weapons testing. There are about 45 of the sensors worldwide, detecting so-called infrasound at frequencies well below the range of human hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Mützelburg, a spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization</span>, which is based in Vienna, said the explosion was detected by more than 20 of the sensors, including one in Antarctica nearly 10,000 miles from Chelyabinsk. Low-frequency sounds do not dissipate easily, so some of the detectors picked up the explosion more than once as the sound circled the globe several times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With knowledge of the energy and information about how fast the meteor was traveling, researchers were then able to calculate the mass of the meteor, about 11,000 metric tons. ''It's all about the kinetic energy of that body,'' which is related to its mass and velocity, said Richard P. Binzel, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor has a certain amount of energy as it enters the atmosphere, Dr. Binzel said. As it hits the air, it starts to decelerate quickly, and then the stress differential between the superpressurized air in front and the less-pressurized air behind causes the rock to break apart violently. ''All that kinetic energy has to be released,'' he said. Only small fragments of the meteor reached the ground, and some have been brought to laboratories in the United States, including the Institute for Rock Magnetism at the University of Minnesota, where a Russian scientist is studying their magnetic properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other teams, the Canadian researchers have used video images of the meteor's east-to-west trail above Chelyabinsk to help calculate its trajectory and orbit. Since the explosion occurred in daylight, Dr. Campbell-Brown said they asked a colleague there to take night photographs from the same locations. By superimposing the images of the meteor's path over the night images containing stars, the researchers should be able to plot the path even more accurately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, they and other teams, including one from the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia, have established that the meteor originated in the inner part of the asteroid belt, in a regular, harmless orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. How it came to have an irregular Earth-crossing orbit is not known, but like other Earth crossers it was probably affected by the gravity of Jupiter or another planet at some point. It then circled the Sun every 18 months in a highly eccentric orbit -- more than two and a half times the Earth-Sun distance at its farthest, close to the orbit of Venus at its nearest -- before it smacked into the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Zuluaga, a member of the Colombian group, said he was inspired by work done soon after the event by Stefan Geens, a blogger in Stockholm. Mr. Geens used several videos -- including one from a camera in Revolution Square in central Chelyabinsk -- to triangulate the path. The video does not show the explosion directly, but rather the shadows of lampposts (and of a huge statue of Lenin), which moved like the shadow on a sundial as the fireball crossed the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, it is easy to pinpoint the coordinates of the Revolution Square camera and others. Dr. Zuluaga said that his team, which included Mr. Geens as a co-author on its most recent paper, is working to improve its calculations by, among other things, learning about the optics of the various video cameras. ''We are trying to understand the distortion we have,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zuluaga thinks that eventually it will be possible to reconstruct the rock's orbit so precisely that researchers may be able to detect it retroactively, by poring over images from sky-surveying telescopes taken the last time it flew near the Earth. ''Then we can assign it a name,'' he said. ''It doesn't have one now, because it's a dead asteroid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to helping scientists plot the meteor's path, the videos that were posted online contributed to a surge in interest in projects to detect asteroids before they strike Earth. In an interview after his Congressional testimony, Dr. Lu said his foundation, which wants to put a privately financed telescope in space within five years, had seen an increase in donations since the explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It made it more real to folks,'' he said. ''There's nothing like a hundred <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos to do that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We look forward to the restoration of these engines by the Bezos team and applaud Jeff's desire to make these historic artifacts available for public display,'' the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's No Heliopause, Silly</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of space, a number of cool things happened since we checked in last week. One was that the Mars rover, Curiosity, which had been having some pesky computer problems, was restored to good health and given an excellent prognosis. Another was that astrophysicists released a map of the infant universe, just 370,000 years after the Big Bang, resplendent with specks that would one day grow into entire galaxies. And then there was the tantalizing report about Voyager 1, which has been hurtling away from the Sun since 1977 and aims to become the first manufactured object to leave the solar system. A headline on a news release from the American Geophysical Union suggested that Voyager 1 had entered the heliopause, or beginning of interstellar space, which would be totally exciting. Not so, said NASA quickly, explaining that while the plucky little spacecraft was busy speeding from the Sun at 38,000 miles an hour -- and was now an impressive 11.5 billion miles from it -- it was too soon to declare heliopause.</p>

While it hasn't worked for all patients, some have gone into remission, even after chemotherapy had failed. The findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, included the startling case of one severely ill patient who, after undergoing the treatment, saw all traces of leukemia vanish in eight days. Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, a leukemia specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the first author of a new study of the therapy, said, ''We had hoped, but couldn't have predicted that the response would be so profound and rapid.''</p>

Now it turns out that, even though they live all over the globe, giant squid are all very closely related genetically, scientists said in a paper last week, surprising the squid cognoscenti. The study looked at the mitochondrial genome of 43 giant squid samples, some that had washed ashore, some pulled up by deepwater fishing nets, and some culled from whale stomachs. In these samples, ''the level of nucleotide diversity is exceptionally low,'' the scientists wrote.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers released the latest and most exquisite baby picture yet of the universe on Thursday, one that showed it to be 80 million to 100 million years older and a little fatter than previously thought, with more matter in it and perhaps ever so slightly lopsided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recorded by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Planck satellite, the image is a heat map of the cosmos as it appeared only 370,000 years after the Big Bang, showing space speckled with faint spots from which galaxies would grow over billions of years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The map, the Planck team said in news conferences and in 29 papers posted online Thursday, is in stunning agreement with the general view of the universe that has emerged over the past 20 years, of a cosmos dominated by mysterious dark energy that seems to be pushing space apart and the almost-as-mysterious dark matter that is pulling galaxies together. It also shows a universe that seems to have endured an explosive burp known as inflation, which was the dynamite in the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement issued by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, Jean-Jacques Dordain, its director general, said, ''The extraordinary quality of Planck's portrait of the infant universe allows us to peel back its layers to the very foundations, revealing that our blueprint of the cosmos is far from complete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the standard cosmological framework, however, the new satellite data underscored the existence of puzzling anomalies that may yet lead theorists back to the drawing board. The universe appears to be slightly lumpier, with bigger and more hot and cold spots in the northern half of the sky as seen from Earth than toward the south, for example. And there is a large, unexplained cool spot in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those anomalies had shown up on previous maps by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, or WMAP, satellite, but some had argued that they were because of a bad analysis or contamination from the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now cosmologists will have to take them more seriously, said Max Tegmark, an expert on the early universe at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not part of the Planck team. He described the new results as ''very exciting.'' It could be, he said, that ''the universe is trying to tell us something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Efstathiou, of Cambridge University, one of the leaders of the Planck project, said in the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> news release: ''Our ultimate goal would be to construct a new model that predicts the anomalies and links them together. But these are early days; so far, we don't know whether this is possible and what type of new physics might be needed. And that's exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Planck satellite was launched in 2009 and has been scanning the sky ever since, recording the faint variations in a haze of radio microwaves that fill the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation used in the kitchen for heating leftovers; that they are important for cosmology was discovered by accident back in 1965 by a pair of Bell Labs radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilson, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Using balloons, a U-2 spy plane and a series of satellites like the WMAP, astronomers have been teasing out the detailed features of this radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The microwaves detected by the Planck date from 370,000 years after the Big Bang, which is as far back as optical or radio telescopes will ever be able to see, cosmologists say. But the patterns within them date from less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe is said to have undergone a violent burst of expansion known as inflation that set cosmic history on the course it has followed ever since. Those patterns are Planck's prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyzing the relative sizes and frequencies of spots and ripples over the years has allowed astronomers to describe the birth of the universe to a precision that would make the philosophers weep. The new data have allowed astronomers to tweak their model a bit. It now seems the universe is 13.8 billion years old, instead of 13.7 billion, and consists by mass of 4.9 percent ordinary matter like atoms, 27 percent dark matter and 68 percent dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span> who commented on the work at a news teleconference sponsored by NASA, called Planck ''cosmology's human genome project,'' saying, ''It shows the seeds from which the current universe grew.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David N. Spergel, a <span class="companylink">Princeton University</span> cosmologist, described the new results as ''beautiful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The standard cosmological model looks even stronger today than yesterday,'' he said. ''The universe remains simple and strange.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest surprise here, astronomers said, is that the universe is expanding slightly more slowly than previous measurements had indicated. The Hubble constant, which characterizes the expansion rate, is 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec -- in the units astronomers use -- according to Planck. Recent ground-based measurements combined with the WMAP data gave a value of 69, offering enough of a discrepancy to make cosmologists rerun their computer simulations of cosmic history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that astronomers once would go to war over a factor of two in measurements of this parameter shows how cosmology has progressed over the past 20 years. Pressed for a possible explanation for the discrepancy, Martin White, a Planck team member from the University of California, Berkeley, said it represents a mismatch between measurements made of the beginning of time and those made more recently, and that it could mean that dark energy, which is speeding up the expansion of the universe, is more complicated than cosmologists thought. He termed the possibility ''pretty radical,'' adding, ''That would be pretty exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also offered striking support for the notion of inflation, which has been the backbone of Big Bang theorizing for 30 years. Under the influence of a mysterious force field during the first trillionth of a fraction of a second, what would become the observable universe ballooned by 100 trillion trillion times in size from a subatomic pinprick to a grapefruit in less than a violent eye-blink, so the story first enunciated by Alan Guth of M.I.T. goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Submicroscopic quantum fluctuations in this force field are what would produce the hot spots in the cosmic microwaves, which in turn would grow into galaxies. According to Planck's measurements, those fluctuations so far fit the predictions of the simplest model of inflation, invented by Andrei Linde of Stanford, to a T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tegmark of M.I.T. said, ''We're homing in on the simplest model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmologists still do not know what might have caused inflation, but the recent discovery of the Higgs boson has provided evidence that the kinds of fields that can provoke such behavior really exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tegmark and others said that another clue to the nature of inflation could come from the anomalies in the microwave data -- the lopsided bumpiness, for example -- that tend to happen on the largest scales in the universe. By the logic of quantum cosmology, they were the first patterns to be laid down on the emerging cosmos; that is to say, when inflation was just starting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He compared it to walking in on a fight. If the fight has been going on for a while, he said, it is impossible to tell who started it or who was hurt first. But if you come in only a few seconds after it started, you have a better chance of figuring out who did what to whom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may be,'' he said, ''we're coming in early to the cosmic brawl.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For about three hours on Wednesday, Voyager 1 had left the solar system -- before a rewritten news release headline pulled it back in. Voyager 1, one of two spacecraft NASA launched in 1977 on a grand tour of the outer planets, is now nearly 11.5 billion miles from the Sun, speeding away at 38,000 miles per hour. In a paper accepted by the journal Geophysical Review Letters, William R. Webber of New Mexico State University and Frank B. McDonald of the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> reported that on Aug. 25 last year, the spacecraft observed a sudden change in the mix of cosmic rays hitting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic rays are high-speed charged particles, mostly protons. Voyager 1's instruments recorded nearly a doubling of cosmic rays from outside the solar system, while the intensity of cosmic rays that had been trapped in the outer solar system dropped by 90 percent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Geophysical Union, publisher of the journal, sent out the news Wednesday morning: ''Voyager 1 has left the solar system.'' NASA officials, surprised, countered with a contrary statement from Edward C. Stone, the Voyager project scientist. ''It is the consensus of the Voyager science team that Voyager 1 has not yet left the solar system or reached interstellar space,'' Dr. Stone said. He said that the critical indicator would be a change in the direction of the magnetic field, not cosmic rays, for marking the outermost boundary of the solar system. In their paper, Dr. Webber and Dr. McDonald (who died only six days after Voyager observed the shift in cosmic rays) did not claim that Voyager 1 was in interstellar space, but had entered a part of the solar system they called the ''heliocliff.'' The geophysical union then sent out another e-mail with the same article but a milder headline: ''Voyager 1 has entered a new region of space.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making a case for the need to detect asteroids before they hit Earth, a former astronaut said Wednesday that the number of casualties would have been enormous had the space rock that exploded in Russia last month blown apart directly over New York City instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd have a lot more than broken windows, that's for sure,'' the former astronaut, Edward Lu, told a Senate panel in Washington. Dr. Lu, also a former executive at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, is now the chief executive of the B612 Foundation, a Silicon Valley group that wants to build a privately financed asteroid-detecting space telescope.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,500 people were injured when the roughly 60-foot-diameter meteor exploded high in the atmosphere near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Feb. 15. Most of the injuries were caused by flying glass from shattered windows when a shock wave from the explosion -- estimated to have been about 30 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima -- hit the city a minute and a half later. ''Had that shock wave been a lot closer to a city, it would have caused a lot more damage,'' Dr. Lu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted that if the so-called Tunguska event -- the explosion of a roughly 150-foot asteroid over Siberia in 1908 -- had occurred over New York, ''whatever the population of New York City is, they'd be gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelyabinsk meteor was not detected by any of the ground-based telescopes, operated by NASA and others, that are surveying the sky for space rocks that are in orbits that could intersect with Earth's. Those search programs are focused on larger asteroids, James Green, director of the planetary science division of NASA, told the Senate panel, the Science and Space Subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far about 10,000 have been detected, including about 95 percent of the estimated 1,100 that are a kilometer (about 1,000 yards) or more in diameter and have the potential to end civilization. So far, Dr. Green said, no asteroid has been found that poses a threat to the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Lu noted that for every asteroid that had been detected, there were probably 100 more that had not been seen, including hundreds of thousands that are the size of the Russian meteor. ''Right now, the amount of warning time that we are likely to get from one of these asteroids is zero,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a meteor was found to be just days from hitting Earth, there is little that could be done, except perhaps evacuating a city or region. But in response to a question from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, Dr. Lu said that given enough lead time, there were various ways to divert an asteroid to make it miss Earth entirely, including something as basic as running into it with a spacecraft to nudge it just a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you find it early, we have many options,'' Dr. Lu said. ''Then you only need to change its trajectory by a very tiny amount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The key is, if you don't know where they are, there's nothing you can do,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some people argue that money would be better spent on more pressing societal problems than on a low-probability event like a civilization-busting asteroid strike, both Mr. Cruz and Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the panel, expressed little skepticism about the scientists' testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm eager for our collective journey to ensure that NASA and all related programs have sufficient resources and sufficient priorities to do what needs to be done,'' said Mr. Cruz, who was elected last year with Tea Party backing, in his opening remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked after the hearing about the senator's position on the NASA budget, only a small portion of which goes toward asteroid detection, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz said she had no comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One difficulty in searching for asteroids from the ground is that the sun often gets in the way, making a small space rock impossible to see. The B612 telescope, called Sentinel, would be oriented in a way that could eliminate that problem. The project is estimated to cost $450 million, and the foundation has a goal of launching the telescope within five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA is not providing any money for the Sentinel project, Dr. Green said the agency was offering some technical help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a later interview, Dr. Lu said that while his group was busy raising money privately and was not seeking money from NASA, ''if they decide that this is something that is of value to them, and they want to have that conversation, then I'd be happy to have that conversation.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several billion years ago, Mars may well have been a pleasant place for tiny microbes to live, with plenty of water as well as minerals that could have served as food, NASA scientists said Tuesday at a news conference on the latest findings from their Mars rover. But they have yet to find signs that actual microbes did live in that oasis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life that probably if this water was around and you had been on the planet, you would have been able to drink it,'' said John P. Grotzinger, the California Institute of Technology geology professor who is the principal investigator for the NASA mission.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In drilling into its first rock, a fine-grained mudstone, the scientists said, the rover Curiosity -- a self-contained science laboratory about the size of a Mini Cooper -- sent back to Earth convincing evidence that Mars was once awash in water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, the Curiosity scientists identified elements in the rocks -- sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon -- that are some of the key ingredients of life, as well as minerals, like sulfates and sulfides, that primitive microbes could eat for food. Dr. Grotzinger said these minerals are ''effectively like batteries'' and can provide an energy source for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This included the presence of clays, one of the main things that scientists were hoping that Curiosity would find on its two-year, $2.5 billion mission. Clays form in waters that have a neutral pH.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have learned in the last 20 years of modern microbiology is that very primitive organisms, they can derive energy just by feeding on rocks,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the Curiosity scientists said they had not yet definitively found the carbon building blocks needed to come together to give rise to living organisms. Two earlier NASA rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, also found strong evidence of liquid water on the Martian surface, but in places on the planet that were highly acidic and salty -- far harsher for any hypothetical organisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three billion years ago, the conditions on Mars changed. With just one-tenth the mass of Earth, Mars was unable to hold on to most of its atmosphere. The inside of the planet cooled, and the volcanoes stopped erupting. The water froze or evaporated and escaped into space. Mars became cold and dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity landed in August in a 96-mile crater named Gale, gouged long ago by a meteor, and has been roaming in the area since then. The rover's ultimate destination is a three-mile-high mountain at the center of the crater that caught the eye of scientists because they detected the presence of clays in observations taken by orbiting spacecraft. Now, long before getting to the mountain, scientists have already found the clays, and these rocks would be prime candidates to look for organics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists and engineers have been taking a deliberate, careful approach to checking the rover's systems. The last instrument to be tested was the drill, which ground up its first rock a month ago. A bit of the powder was then scooped up and dropped in a sophisticated chemistry laboratory for analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surface of Mars today is cold, dry and battered by radiation from space. But planetary scientists think young Mars, more than three billion years ago, was a far more hospitable place, with a thicker atmosphere, warmer weather and water flowing at the surface. Some scientists believe that if life ever took hold there, it might persist even today beneath the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity is not carrying any instruments that can detect Martian life, past or present, but it can identify so-called organic molecules, which contain carbon and hydrogen atoms. The presence of organic molecules would not prove the presence of life, since many nonliving chemical reactions can produce organic molecules. But organic molecules are a necessary prerequisite for life -- at least, life as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the Curiosity scientists cannot say that the rock contained organics, but neither can they rule out the possibility. Rather, since their instruments did measure some simple organics, the researchers are sorting out whether the organics came from the Martian rock, from contamination brought from Earth or were formed in chemical reactions as the rock powder was heated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the scientists are excited by the possibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have an image now of possibly a lake, a fresh water lake, on Mars with a thicker atmosphere,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answers will take a while to discern. Science operations are delayed as engineers work to diagnose and fix what went wrong with the rover's computer last week when Curiosity failed to send back science data and then failed to go to sleep as scheduled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the rover's computer memory had become corrupted, and the engineers switched operations to an identical backup. They are also figuring out whether the corrupted memory may clear up when the computer is restarted or whether the errors are permanent, requiring modification of computer programs to avoid that part of the memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Sun will be in the way between Mars and Earth for most of April, making communications impossible. Limited science work is expected to resume in a few days, but further drilling of rocks will wait until May.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twice on a recent Friday, the cosmos intruded rudely on us earthlings. A meteor exploded over western Siberia, shattering windows, injuring hundreds and scaring pretty much everyone else. That same day, an asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of us, close enough to arch many an eyebrow among astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One earthling, at least, looked on the bright side.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It allows me, when I talk about asteroids, to reference an actual event where people got hurt,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan for going on two decades. Not that Dr. Tyson was glad that people had been injured. Far from it. All the same, he said over drinks in Lower Manhattan, this cosmic activity ''gives punctuation to my sentence that the human race is at risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Think of it,'' he said, ''as a shot across our bow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warning that the planet could be imperiled has a way of focusing the mind wondrously. So we asked about a huge asteroid called Apophis, whose name alone ought to give one pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's from the Egyptian god of death and destruction,'' Dr. Tyson said. ''It was named knowing that it crosses Earth's orbit.'' Otherwise, he said, ''we would have named it something less threatening, like Tiffany or Bambi.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say it will fly uncomfortably close to us in 2029 and again in 2036 and yet again in 2068. Luck, Dr. Tyson is convinced, will not be forever on our side. ''What is a certainty is that one day Apophis and Earth will collide,'' he said. ''So our goal should be, if the survival of our civilization is a concern and a priority, to find a way to deflect it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know how to do it,'' he said, but he added this disheartened postscript: ''There's no funded plan to do so anywhere in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of planetary cataclysm was not on our agenda when we invited Dr. Tyson to break bread. The original question was simpler: Could the latest brushes with asteroids get people thinking about the universe more, well, cosmically?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because his schedule is forever tight, a proposed meal turned into late-afternoon drinks at the Beekman Pub, around the corner from City Hall and a short walk from his home. (Memo to accounting: you will be happy to hear that all he had to drink was a Diet Pepsi, with lime. His tablemate splurged on a beer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson -- Bronx-reared and, as he likes to point out, born in the same week in 1958 as NASA -- is given to speaking not in whole sentences but, rather, in whole paragraphs. He has a gift for putting the fizz in physics and taking the sigh out of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chances are he is no stranger to you. He is a television semiregular. Dr. Tyson even turned up, in illustrated form, in the January issue of Action Comics, identifying a plausible location in the real cosmos for Krypton, which had been Superman's home planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He theorized that Krypton could have orbited a red dwarf star in the Corvus constellation, 27 light years from Earth. That's roughly 160 trillion miles away, in case you are thinking of a trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole thing, he said, was DC Comics' idea: ''As a lifelong resident of Metropolis, the least I could do is allow my likeness to be in conversation with Superman.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Dr. Tyson is less focused on the planetarium than on creating a new iteration of ''Cosmos,'' the hit PBS series featuring Carl Sagan, which was first broadcast in 1980. This sequel, for the Fox network, is planned for early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of its producers is Seth MacFarlane. Yup, that Seth MacFarlane, the ''Family Guy'' guy and (to some viewers) the cringe-inducing host of this year's Academy Awards show. Whatever one may think of his brand of comedy, ''Seth MacFarlane is deeply committed to science literacy in this country,'' Dr. Tyson said, and the two of them share a goal: reinforcing the idea that ''science needs to be taken to people's hearts in a way that they become better citizens for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is he saying that we treat science and mathematics shabbily in this country, where many people are all too proud to admit to a fear of all sums? Actually, Dr. Tyson said, ''I don't think the country's less literate in math and science than ever before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I cite, for example, how familiar people are with images from the Hubble telescope,'' he said. ''The Hubble did not require a P.R. person to become famous. It did all the P.R. on its own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop culture, too, is part of ''a positive trend line,'' given science-themed blockbuster films like ''Avatar'' and the durable ''Star Wars'' series, and popular television programs like the ''C.S.I.'' and ''NCIS'' franchises and ''The Big Bang Theory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a day when we didn't have science at all in television programming,'' Dr. Tyson said between sips of his soda. ''Now it's there, without having to stereotype the lab-coated, wire-haired character.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the real problem, as he sees it: ''You have people who are not scientifically literate who have risen to positions of power and control,'' whether on local school boards or in Congress. He mentioned Representative Paul C. Broun, a Georgia Republican (and doctor) who sits on the House Science Committee and who says the world is 9,000 years old and was literally created in six days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters, Dr. Tyson said, need to grasp the consequences of their electoral choices, especially if they produce officials who ''undermine the source of creativity for tomorrow's economy.'' Meddle with the citizenry's understanding of science and technology, he said, and people ''will emerge on the other side incapable of making the discoveries and innovations that the nation requires in order to stay economically competitive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the Creation, ''if you use the Bible as your science textbook, you will go astray -- there's no question about it,'' he said, adding: ''Galileo understood this. He can be credited with drawing a line in the sand with his famous quote that the Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all due respect to Galileo, he does not top Dr. Tyson's list of science greats. ''The first person I would meet the day a time machine gets invented'' is Isaac Newton, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this afternoon, Dr. Tyson wore a pale yellow tie emblazoned with Newton's image. It instantly caught the eye, as did a red rose tucked into the breast pocket of his jacket, a souvenir from a luncheon that day. The rose was in itself both a science lesson and a reminder of the planet's fragility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flowers capture some of why we value life,'' he said. ''If a flower were permanent, it would be so much less meaningful to the person you gave it to. It's the fact that you know it will die in a matter of days that you care for it and you appreciate its beauty all the more.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Search for Life That Is Very, Very Different From Our Own</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By David Toomey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">268 pp. <span class="companylink">W. W. Norton &amp; Company</span>. $25.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's life, Jim, but not as we know it. The familiar phrase, apocryphally attributed to ''Star Trek,'' encapsulates David Toomey's study of the search for species flourishing in places where life was thought to be insupportable. ''Weird Life'' is a breakneck tour through natural history, encounters of an impossible kind, researchers as weird as the organisms they pursue that leads the reader to wonder where science ends and fantasy begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story begins very much down to earth. The discovery of a hidden microbial world within our own planet's ecosystems is not many decades old. Life, of a very odd sort, is much more ubiquitous than was once thought. Some micro-organisms thrive in boiling water under pressure; others feed on sulfur, salt, deadly poisonous elements, even radioactivity. Toomey describes one fungus found in the ''water core of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, ingeniously and fearlessly converting nuclear radiation into usable energy and managing radiation damage by keeping copies of the same chromosome in every cell.'' ''Extremophiles'' can be found living in ice, under the sea floor, multiplying in clouds or huddled implausibly deep beneath the ground in a newly discovered geological biosphere. These tiny cells -- a pinhead would be a world to them -- do not look particularly spectacular. Most of them are just minute rods that grow by fission. But they are chemical factories of extraordinary versatility. As one distinguished microbiologist has put it, if they can find a way of grabbing an electron, they evolve to do so. Nobody knows how many species of extremophiles there are, and many more wait to be discovered, which should be exciting enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is already known is even more remarkable: for all their mysteriousness these tiny strangers share an ancestor with all us everyday weeds, butterflies and mammals. The extremophiles represent alternative, carbon-based life paths that diverged from the rest of existence more than three billion years ago. Some biologists believe that these microbes resemble our common ancestor, because they were adapted to an early Earth very different from the gentle Gaia we have today. They lurk in inhospitable corners and are tough enough to survive space travel, which leads to thoughts of life on Earth being seeded from elsewhere. Perhaps extremophiles are more than just strange anomalies. Toomey's journey is about to leave Earth and head for the planets and the stars beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars is the first stop. The thought that life might have been introduced from the red planet is far from new. Bill Clinton endorsed the possibility of life on Mars in 1996, but this claim has since been called into question. Nonetheless, there are probably places where extreme extremophiles from Earth could still prosper near its icy poles. But the search must move on, and here the science starts to merge with science fiction. It is certainly possible that the space probe Kepler has now detected numerous Earthlike planets circulating other stars in the galaxy, and some of them must be just the right distance from their own suns to be suitable for life. Lou Allamandola, the founder and director of the Astrophysics and Astrochemistry Laboratory at NASA's Ames Research Center, is replicating in the laboratory the conditions on comet's tails, showing how complex organic compounds might be synthesized there. But then. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are used to thinking of life based upon the distinctive properties of carbon and water. It does not have to be like that, according to astrobiologists. Life probably requires solvents, and a way for complex molecules to be built up: a prerequisite for self-replication that is one of life's essential features. However, out on Titan (a moon of Saturn) there is liquid methane in which life could arise and whole new biochemical pathways could be imagined. A National Research Council report concludes: ''If life is an intrinsic property of chemical reactivity, life should exist on Titan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why stop there? On Triton (a moon of Neptune), where temperatures are so low that gases liquefy, a metabolism based on strange silica compounds and liquid nitrogen has been posited. Or again, astrobiologists have proposed life in the clouds surrounding Venus, and based on sulfuric acid. Why not life around red dwarfs if one tweaks the elements in a different fashion? Or in the multiverses that allegedly exist alongside our own universe, but through an impenetrable curtain? Or near absolute zero? Life -- or at least theoretical life -- seems to be possible almost everywhere and at all times by Toomey's account. Even on the edges of black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a real problem with these speculations if they are to be regarded as scientific hypotheses, and Toomey gives them far too easy a ride. He does know about Karl Popper's distinction between science and metaphysics, because it appears in a footnote in his book: science, Popper holds, is testable and falsifiable. Virtually all the fun speculations of the astrobiologists would fail these stringent but necessary criteria. Provided the chemistry and physics are plausible, just about any bio-creation is presented as scientifically justified. The trouble is that they are not yet capable of being falsified, or indeed testable by experiment. It must be a tremendously enjoyable intellectual exercise paddling around in the seas of faraway worlds imagining life as a mist, or life that takes three millenniums to form a thought, or life based on liquid nitrogen. But it is not science. It is playful imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leads to the interesting notion that the only difference between science and science fiction in astrobiology is who says what. If the creature from outer space comes from the pen of Ursula K. Le Guin, it is science fiction, whereas if it is Carl Sagan (he of the Jovian ''floaters''), it must be science. Where predictions have been made of weird life in an earthly system -- like claims of arsenical life in Lake Mono -- they have quickly been brought to account and sent packing. Provably wrong ideas in science get banished to an amnesiac world. A playful imagination might suggest that they are free to interbreed there and generate new life-forms. Science, Jim, but not as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which brings us to money. Science proceeds by fashion as much as by necessity, and astrobiology is fashionable, which is doubtless why Toomey followed it as a topic. Meanwhile, on planet Earth it's estimated that 86 percent of all species -- weird or not -- have not been ­discovered, described or named. As the naturalists who might do so are themselves becoming rarer and rarer, it is hard not to regret the funds flying to the untestable reaches of space, when so much remains to be discovered among real, living, ­carbon-based organisms here on boring old Earth.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- As Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist, used to say, the most overwhelming obstacle to exploring the cosmos isn't gravity. It's the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention the money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Bas Lansdorp began dreaming more than a decade ago about establishing the first permanent human colony on Mars, his primary focus was not on overcoming the technological challenges. It was the business model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the technology we need exists already -- or nearly exists,'' he said. ''I just couldn't figure out how to finance it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp, a 36-year-old Dutch engineer and entrepreneur, does not have the name recognition of Dennis Tito, the American financier and space tourist, who announced a plan last month to send two people on a round-trip Mars flyby in 2018. Nor can Mr. Lansdorp hope to match the deep pockets of Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, who has proposed sending as many as 80,000 people to the Red Planet and charging them $500,000 each. Richard Branson, the Virgin entrepreneur, has space aspirations, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lansorp is convinced that he has found the perfect plan to raise the $6 billion he says he needs to land an initial crew of four people on the Martian surface by 2023. The entire mission -- from the astronauts' selection and training to their arrival and construction of a permanent settlement -- would be broadcast as a worldwide, multiyear reality television show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many people do you think would want to watch the first humans arrive on Mars?'' Mr. Lansdorp asked in a recent interview, recalling the more than 600 million viewers who were said to have tuned in to the grainy, black-and-white images of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will be one of the biggest events in human history,'' he said. ''We are talking about creating a major media spectacle, much bigger than the moon landings or the Olympics, and with huge potential for revenues coming from TV rights and sponsorships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the record, Mr. Lansdorp will be executive producer, not an actor, in this extravaganza: He does not plan to make the trip himself. And despite the significant skepticism his plan has raised in some quarters, he cites his success in starting and cashing out of the wind-energy company Ampyx Power -- a company trying to use pilotless, tethered aircraft to generate electricity -- as evidence that he can turn lofty ideas into financially viable realities. Mr. Lansdorp declined to say how much he had made selling his stake in Ampyx, a privately held company, other than indicating it had been enough that he would not have to work for at least several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just 10 years to select and prepare its first crew, the project, called Mars One, expects to begin recruiting prospective astronauts online this spring. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, be physically fit and speak English, and they must be willing to live out the final selection process and an eight-year training program -- not to mention the Mars mission itself -- under the constant stare of a television camera. No specific technical skills or experience are required, but be sure to read the fine print: For reasons of cost and logistics, this is a one-way trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reality meets talent show, with no ending and the whole world watching,'' is how Paul Romer, a Dutch television executive and the co-creator of the original ''Big Brother'' series, describes it in an endorsement on the Mars One Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Mars One is raising more eyebrows than cash. Until this year, the project was financed almost entirely by Mr. Lansdorp himself. Last month, Mars One secured its first commitments from outside investors, and those funds will be used to finance the first conceptual design studies for the various hardware components, including the spacecraft and lander, life support systems, supply vehicles and communications systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site has received about 1.7 million unique visitors since it went live last June, according to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Analytics. But more than 8,000 people, from more than 100 countries, have already e-mailed résumés since online recruiting began in January. Dr. Norbert Kraft, a specialist in aerospace medicine and a former researcher at NASA, as well as the space agencies of Japan and Russia, leads a team of experts who will vet applicants for their basic suitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a big trip,'' Dr. Kraft said. ''They will have to be really ready for that physically and psychologically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool will be narrowed to a few hundred candidates by 2014, at which point Mars One hopes to begin televising the process in select countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick du Plooy, a medical student applying from Pretoria, South Africa, confessed that he was not a huge fan of standard-fare reality TV and hoped Mars One would be ''held to a higher quality standard.'' Mr. Plooy, 22, said he imagined the grueling routine of his coming medical internship and residency years would help him prepare for the rigors of life as an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp has set up Mars One as a nonprofit foundation, but it is the controlling shareholder in a for-profit company, Interplanetary Media Group, that owns the exclusive right to sell mission broadcast and advertising rights. Just how much those rights might be worth is anyone's guess -- but Mars One is betting that it is a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp cites a report published last year by the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> that said the winter and summer Games -- three-week events, staged every two years -- had generated about $5 billion in revenue from 2009 to 2012, of which more than $3.9 billion had come from the sale of broadcast rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more direct comparison, reality TV, has generated significant revenue for broadcasters for years. Although past its peak, the British version of ''Big Brother'' generated in 2006 as much as a fourth of the annual advertising revenue for the country's publicly owned Channel 4 network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Viacom</span>, the American media company, attributed much of the double-digit growth in its cable television ad sales in recent years to the success of ''Jersey Shore,'' which ended a six-year run on MTV television in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not everyone is convinced that Snooki in Space would fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea of flying to Mars one-way is not as outlandish as it may appear,'' said Robert Zubrin, former chairman of the United States National Space Society and a longtime advocate of a privately financed human mission to Mars. And he argues that it could be done with a budget ''in the single-digit billions'' of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I am very skeptical that it can be financed by broadcast revenues,'' he said. ''The initial mission could get great deal of attention. But how long could you sustain interest in a Martian 'Little House on the Prairie' at the level of revenues that would be required?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp winces a little at the reality-show label. ''It's a very difficult tradeoff between the goals of the project and to finance this mission,'' he conceded. ''This is not 'Big Brother Goes to Mars.' It's important this is treated as a very serious project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is for that reason, he said, that Mars One is focusing first on gaining credibility with prospective investors, sponsors and aerospace suppliers. Mr. Lansdorp declined to say how much he had budgeted for the initial publicity campaign, but experts like Mr. Zubrin estimate that it might take $30 million to $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Meijer, chief operating officer of the Dutch unit of <span class="companylink">Trifork</span>, a software developer based in Copenhagen, said his company -- which is also supplying Web-host and network technology for Mars One -- agreed to invest an undisclosed sum with the goal of raising its own profile through association with the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are not many of these kind of projects around,'' Mr. Meijer said. ''For us, it is a chance to become attached to this not only from a technology perspective, but also to benefit from the marketing and branding exposure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''It's also a great conversation starter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, discussions are under way with prospective suppliers. Mars One says it held initial talks with about a half-dozen companies, including big industry players like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for its heavy rocket launchers, and Thales of France, for its pressurized cargo vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week, Mr. Lansdorp said, he will announce Mars One's first supplier contract, with a U.S. aerospace company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp is more pragmatic than wistful about why he does not plan himself to migrate to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I was 20 years old and I first started dreaming of this, I thought I would go myself. But in the 15 years that have passed since, I know a lot more about myself,'' he said. ''I am an entrepreneur. I am really not the right kind of person. I am impatient, and impatience is one of the worst character flaws for someone in a small group.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus: ''I have a really nice girlfriend and I know she would never come with me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few such constraints would hold Junwei Cheng earthbound. Mr. Cheng, who has applied for the Mars mission, is a 26-year-old metals importer from Taiyuan, a city of four million people in northeast China. He admits that he is not much of a people person but says he is used to living in cramped surroundings. ''Sometimes when I take the subway or the bus, I can't even find space to put my feet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And moving to another planet would not require a big personal sacrifice, Mr. Cheng added, ''because I have not had a girlfriend for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDIn their bones, physicists feel it is the long-lost Higgs boson, but in science, feelings take second place to data. So these same physicists admit that it will take more work and analysis before they will have the cold numbers that clinch the case that the new particle announced on July 4 last year is in fact the exact boson first predicted by Peter Higgs and others in 1964 to be the arbiter of mass and cosmic diversity. ''Personally, I have no problems calling this a Higgs boson,'' said Joe Incandela, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and spokesman, or leader, of one of the teams, known as CMS, that reported the new particle last July. ''If it's not, I won't mind eating my words, because it would be so much more interesting.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke on the eve of the Moriond workshop in La Thuile, Italy, where on Wednesday CERN physicists will present the latest analysis of some 2,000 trillion collisions recorded by the Large Hadron Collider. There could still be surprises, but so far, physicists say, the particle is on target with the predictions of the Standard Model, the current reigning theory in physics. Which is a triumph for the theorists who invented the boson, but might be a disappointment for those who dream of revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in post-discovery depression,'' said Eilam Gross, one of the CERN physicists on the Atlas team. ''What happens when you search for something and then it turns out to be exactly what you are looking for?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened in the first instant of the Big Bang? What happens at the middle of a black hole where matter and time blink in or out of existence? What is the dark matter whose gravitational influence, astronomers say, shapes the structures of galaxies, or the dark energy that is forcing the universe apart? Why is the universe full of matter but not antimatter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what, finally, is the fate of the universe? These are all questions that the Standard Model, the vanilla-sounding set of equations that ruled physics for the last half century, does not answer. Some of them could be answered by the unproven theory called supersymmetry, which among other things is needed to explain why whatever mass the Higgs has is low enough to be discovered in the first place and not almost infinite. It predicts a whole new population of elementary particles -- called superpartners to the particles physicists already know about -- one of which could be the dark matter that pervades the universe. If such particles exist, they would affect the rate at which Higgs bosons decay into other particles, but the CERN teams have yet to record what they consider a convincing deviation from the Standard Model predictions for those decays. Supersymmetry is still at best a beautiful idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing that has hampered progress is that physicists still do not agree on how much the new particle weighs. Eyebrows were raised in December when the Atlas team reported that their two different methods of measuring the boson's mass do not agree. They get a mass of 126.6 billion electron volts by watching for it to decay into a pair of gamma rays, and 123.5 billion electron volts when they look for a signature of four charged particles. The spread of more than three billion electron volts means the error bars for the two measurements do not overlap. The results from the rival CMS are closer together, in the middle, consistent with a mass of 125.8 billion electron volts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlas physicists say the effect is most likely a statistical fluctuation that will be cured eventually with more data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it matter how much a Higgs boson weighs? It could determine the fate of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2011, shortly after CERN teams first declared that they had seen signs of the famous boson with a mass of 125 billion electron volts, Gian Giudice, a CERN theorist, and his colleagues ran the numbers and concluded that the universe was in a precarious condition and could be prone to collapse in the far, far future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason lies in the Higgs field, the medium of which the Higgs boson is the messenger and which determines the structure of empty space, i.e., the vacuum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It works like this. The Higgs field, like everything else in nature, is lazy, and, like water running downhill, always seeks to be in the state of lowest energy. Physicists assume that the Higgs field today is in the lowest state possible, but Dr. Giudice found that was not the case. What counts as rock bottom in today's universe could turn out to be just a plateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our universe is like a rock perched precariously on a mountaintop, he explained, in what physicists call a metastable state. The Higgs field could drop to a lower value by a process known as quantum tunneling, although it is not imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Giudice's calculations suggest that it would take much longer than the age of the universe; the whole Milky Way galaxy could disappear into a black hole long before then. Which is good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that should happen -- tomorrow or billions of years from now -- a bubble would sweep out through the universe at the speed of light, obliterating the laws of nature as we know them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of this work caused a flurry in the press. As Jeremy Bernstein, the noted physicist and author, wrote in a recent e-mail after reading the news, ''Help!!!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not time to dial up a Mayan priest for guidance yet. The calculations assume that the Standard Model is the final word in physics, good for all times and places and energies -- something that no physicist really believes. Theories like supersymmetry or string theory could intercede at higher energies and change the outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The calculations also depend crucially on the mass of the top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, as well as the Higgs, neither of which have been weighed precisely enough yet to determine the fate of the universe. If the top quark were just a little lighter or the Higgs a little heavier, 130 billion electron volts, Dr. Giudice said, the vacuum would in fact be stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a puzzle, he said, why the universe exists in such a critical state. In an e-mail, Dr. Giudice wrote, ''Why do we happen to live at the edge of collapse?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on, ''In my view, the message about near-criticality of the universe is the most important thing we have learned from the discovery of the Higgs boson so far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guido Tonelli of CERN and the University of Pisa, said, ''If true, it is somehow magic.'' We wouldn't be having this discussion, he said, if there hadn't been enough time already for this universe to produce galaxies, stars, planets and ''human beings who are attempting to produce a vision of the world,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So, in some sense, we are here, because we have been lucky, because for this particular universe the lottery produced a certain set of numbers, which allow the universe to have an evolution, which is very long.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: March 11, 2013, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the next steps for physicists after the discovery of a Higgs-like particle last July by two teams of researchers at CERN misstated the year the teams first declared that they had seen signs of the particle and Gian Giudice, a CERN theorist, concluded that the universe was in a precarious condition. It was December 2011, not December 2012.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At lunchtime on Friday, things were not looking good: a rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station was having problems with its thrusters, imperiling its ability to get where it was going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake were some treats for the astronauts -- fresh fruit plus other food and clothing, parts for air purifiers and some science experiments -- as well as the reputation of the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a company NASA has hired to ferry supplies to the space station (and, eventually, people). If the thrusters could not be fixed, the cargo would never arrive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the drama subsided quickly. By late Friday afternoon, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> reported that it had fixed the problem and that the balky thrusters had merely delayed the arrival of the cargo ship at the station by perhaps just one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching had gone fine. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off on schedule at 10:10 a.m. on Friday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and 10 minutes later deposited the cargo ship -- a capsule called Dragon -- into orbit around Earth. The idea was for the Dragon, carrying 1,500 pounds of cargo, to adjust its orbit through a series of thruster firings and arrive at the space station on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, soon after the capsule separated from the rocket, engineers at <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> noticed that only one of the four groups of thrusters was ready to begin firing. NASA requires that at least three groups of thrusters be working before it will allow the capsule anywhere near the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a little frightening there,'' Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, said during a telephone news conference after the launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said that there seemed to be a blockage or stuck valve, but that repeatedly opening and closing valves to the propellant tanks cleared the problem with the thrusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're actually looking quite good,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at NASA and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said they would discuss when to reschedule the space station rendezvous, which will now occur on Sunday at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the biggest glitch that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has faced so far in its cargo flights. Last May, it made its first successful trip to the space station to demonstrate its readiness and followed up in October with the first delivery under a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October mission was successful despite the failure of one of nine engines on the Falcon 9 rocket. The rocket's computer shut down the malfunctioning engines, and the other eight were able to compensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Friday's cargo ship episode was not the only headache for NASA this week. Farther away, NASA's robotic rover on Mars, the Curiosity, also experienced a serious mishap. On Thursday, the rover put itself in ''safe mode,'' when it discovered the memory in its computer had malfunctioned. The mission controllers switched to the other computer -- the rover contains two for redundancy -- and it will take several days before the rover resumes its scientific work.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday morning, people of the Russian city of Chelyabinsk looked up to see a bright object streak across the sky. About a minute later, they were buffeted by a thunderous shock wave that shattered windows and caused hundreds of injuries.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists used recordings of ultra-low-frequency sound waves to estimate that the asteroid that entered the atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour was 55 feet wide, weighed 10,000 tons, and released energy 30 times that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers had no chance of spotting the asteroid beforehand, because it came from the same direction as the rising Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even larger asteroid, designated 2012 DA14, which astronomers had been diligently tracking, passed a close, but not too close, 17,200 miles from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two, coming from different directions, were unrelated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chemicals of modern human civilization -- nitrogen fertilizers, artificial sweeteners, prescription drugs -- wash into bodies of water with unknown effects on wildlife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swedish scientists were curious about what a common anti-anxiety drug, Oxazepam, might be doing to wild European perch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the experiment, the fish became less anxious. They were more active, ate faster and had less regard for their fellow fish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such behavioral changes, if reflected in the wild, could alter the ecological balance. A less anxious perch might boldly venture out and get itself eaten by a predator.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are weather officials to do when a giant storm loses hurricane status just before it comes ashore?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the conundrum the National Hurricane Center faced in October as Hurricane Sandy headed up the Atlantic coast. As forecast, the winds dropped below hurricane levels as the storm approached landfall. Once it was classified as a post-tropical cyclone, the center could no longer issue official advisories and passed the task to local officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report released last week, the center called on its parent agency, the <span class="companylink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>, to change the rules so that it could still issue advisories to emphasize the dangers of storm surges even after the winds weaken slightly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Way to See</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a bionic eye, but it is a first technological step to restoring vision for the blind. On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration approved what amounts to an artificial retina -- special glasses that contain a camera and a video processor, which send signals to a sheet of electrodes that have been implanted in the eyes. The electrodes send the signals to the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment is the first to give sight to the blind, although only rudimentary aspects -- the outlines of objects and contrasts between light and dark. Still, that is enough to enable at least some of the blind patients using the device to detect street crosswalks, the presence of people or cars, or even to read large type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVOLUTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Multitalented Gene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single gene mutation 35,000 years ago appears to help explain the distinctive appearance of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and other East Asian people. Scientists engineered mice with the East Asian version of this gene, called EDAR, and these mice indeed had thicker hair shafts characteristic of East Asians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the surprise of the researchers, the genetically engineered mice also had more sweat glands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese member of the research team tested people in China and found that they had more numerous sweat glands than people elsewhere. The researchers said the mutation occurred in central China, where extra sweat glands would have been a boon to the hunter-gatherers who lived in the warm, humid region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASTRONOMY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Name That Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Shatner may get to name a moon of Pluto. In 2011 and 2012, astronomers at the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., using the Hubble Space Telescope, spotted two undiscovered bodies orbiting the former planet and designated them P4 and P5 -- the fourth and fifth known moons of Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute is inviting the public to vote on more permanent names in a poll at plutorocks.com. Voting ends at noon on Feb. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In classical mythology, Pluto is the lord of the underworld, so the nine names proposed by the astronomers included Styx (the river that divides Earth from the underworld) and Cerberus (the three-headed dog guarding the gates to the underworld).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shatner, best known as Capt. James T. Kirk of ''Star Trek,'' suggested Vulcan and Romulus, the names of fictional worlds on the show; Romulus is taken (it's a moon around an asteroid), but the astronomers took him up on Vulcan, adding that to the poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the more than 288,500 ballots cast as of Monday afternoon, Vulcan led the tally with more than 87,000 votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the polls close next Monday, the astronomers will confer with the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> on the final names.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEPUTATSKOYE, Russia -- Ever since the meteor exploded somewhere over this impoverished Siberian town, Larisa V. Briyukova wondered what to do with the fist-size stone she found under a hole in the roof tiles of her woodshed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, a stranger knocked on her door, offering about $60, Ms. Briyukova said. After some haggling, they settled on a price of $230. A few hours later, another man pulled up, looked at the hole in the roof and offered $1,300.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I regret selling it,'' said Ms. Briyukova, a 43-year-old homemaker. ''But then, who knows? The police might have come and taken it away anyway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, terror rained from the skies, blowing out windows and scaring people over an enormous swath of Siberia. But by Monday, for many people what fell from the sky had turned to pure gold, and it touched off a rush to retrieve the fragments, many buried in deep February snows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those out prospecting looked a lot like Sasha Zarezina, 8, who happily plunged into a snowbank here in this village of a thousand, laughing, kicking and throwing up plumes of powdery snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then she stopped, bent over and started to dig. ''I found one!'' she yelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warm breath and a rub on her pants later, a small black pebble, oval like a river rock, charred and smooth, was freed of ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trade in material from meteorites is largely illegal, there is a flourishing global market, with fragments widely available for sale on the Internet, usually at modest prices. At least one from the recent meteor was available on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> on Monday for $32, and there is a Web site called Star-bits.com devoted to the trade -- much to the displeasure of scientists and the countries where the objects were found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on, NASA reported that the meteor, the largest known celestial body to enter Earth's atmosphere in 100 years, was an airburst fireball type that would shower untold thousands of fragments onto the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the scramble now under way to find them, residents of towns like this one -- founded in the 1920s around a collective dairy farm that is now defunct -- are looking for small holes in the snow that hold the promise of yielding up polished black rocks encased in tiny clumps of ice, formed from the last expiring heat of their long journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All it takes is looking carefully,'' said Sasha, who was out searching after school on Monday. ''The stones are in the snowdrifts. To find a stone you find a hole. And then you dig.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Villagers here have plastic bags, matchboxes and jars filled with dozens of stones. One even tore a hole in the coat one woman was wearing outside Friday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is Russia, so the excitement became tinged with anxiety on Monday as unknown cars appeared, cruising the streets and bearing men who refused to answer questions but offered stacks of rubles worth hundreds, then thousands, of dollars for the fragments. Strangely, no authorities were anywhere in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">M3-Media, a financial news site, reported that under Russian law a person can gain legal title to a meteorite, but only if it is reported to the authorities and submitted to a laboratory for tests. The laboratory will charge 20 percent of the estimated value of the object for certification, the site reported, citing the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In practice, though, the search for remnants of the meteor has become a haphazard, unregulated scramble, wholly lacking coordinated effort or scientific oversight in the collection of specimens from one of the most significant events in years for the community of scientists who study such things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have a mechanism to prevent this from happening,'' said Viktor Grokhovsky, an assistant professor of metallurgy at Southern Ural Federal University, one of the scientists who made the positive identification of meteorites on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law enforcement agencies actually blocked scientists from visiting a suspected impact site on Lake Chebarkul over the weekend, Professor Grokhovsky said. Yet here at Deputatskoye, where the first scientific expedition is planned for Tuesday, not a police officer was in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We send up spaceships to asteroids to obtain this material, at great expense, and here it flew right to us,'' he said. ''It would be nice if the government coordinated with us, the scientists. When we want to be somewhere, they won't let us near. When we want them to be somewhere, they are nowhere to be found.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the streets a man reeking of alcohol sidled up to a foreigner. Shifting his cigarette from his right hand to his left, he fished from a pocket a rock the size of a goose egg, its surface as smooth, dark and mysterious as onyx. It was for sale, he said. He did not give a price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fragments landed in a social landscape of distrust of the authorities, where police corruption is widespread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With word of the rising prices rippling through the village, some women, looking with piercing, paranoid eyes at strangers, refused to speak about what their children might have found. Others expressed fear that the police would confiscate the stones -- and in turn sell them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody knows anything; nobody says anything,'' one said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another said, unconvincingly, ''We threw our stones away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intact meteor, estimated by NASA to weigh about 7,000 tons, bore immense energy as it entered the atmosphere over Alaska. It was the largest source of infrasound waves -- low-frequency waves of pressure -- ever recorded by a system set up globally to monitor compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. But after the meteor exploded, the small bits of debris slowed to terminal velocity, about the speed of a piece of gravel dropped from a skyscraper. Such remnants would not create craters on touchdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All about, tracks meander through the deep snow, ending at tiny excavations two or three feet deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They fell everywhere in the village,'' Alfia N. Zharkova, a mother of two, who has a plastic bag filled with black stones, said in an interview in her kitchen. ''The children find them. Everybody who has children has piles of these.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She found one Friday. ''I went out to feed the cow and I see a hole in the ice,'' Ms. Zharkova said. ''And there's a stone in the hole. So I just reach down and pick it up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A neighbor, Aleksandra Gerasimova, a 61-year-old retired milkmaid, said a meteorite tore a hole in her coat, which she displayed Monday. She was wearing it Friday when she stepped outside to investigate the flash in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was standing with my husband, and some of it fell on us,'' Ms. Gerasimova said. ''This rock fell down and into my jacket. I felt it hit me. I looked up, and there was nothing above me, not a bird, nothing. Imagine how frightened I was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, two men, apparently speculators, showed up at her house and offered to buy her stone. ''I didn't open the door,'' she said. ''Why should I sell it? I have a grandson I will give it to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the school bus pulled up Monday afternoon, children shot out and scattered over the snowy fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Sasha, a boisterous girl in a maroon jacket and tan checkered pants, found the small pebble in the snow, she said she intended to ''save it for my own children,'' but quickly reconsidered. ''I will sell it for 100 million euros.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I have snow in my boot,'' the little Russian girl confessed, but added: ''I'm used to the cold. I like the cold. I grew up in the cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't mind it at all.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some high-rises in this city, the first modern urban community to have felt the breath of a cosmic close encounter, every window blew out on the top floor; elsewhere, the ground floors suffered.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More ominously, reports came in to local news media over the weekend of stranger phenomena: behind unshattered apartment windows, glass jugs were said to explode into shards, dishes to crack, electronics to die. Balconies rattled. One man said a bottle broke right in his hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna V. Popova was at home with her daughter when she saw the flash, then heard explosions, then found the windows of her enclosed balcony blown in; her neighbor, with identical windows, escaped without property damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people suffered, not us alone,'' Ms. Popova said, but added that there seemed to be randomness in whose property was damaged. ''Who are we supposed to blame for all this? Nobody of course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists believe the space rock that tore through the atmosphere on Friday morning and blew apart here was the largest to have entered the atmosphere since 1908 and that it was unusual as well for the scale of its effects: more than 1,200 people injured and broad property damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the event is providing a first indication of the type of structural and infrastructural costs meteors can exact from a highly industrialized society. NASA scientists say a meteor of this size strikes the Earth about once every hundred years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shattered glass caused most of the damage and injuries here in Chelyabinsk, a sprawling industrial city of about a million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What shattered the glass, scientists say, was both the explosion as the meteor fragmented and the waves of pressure created as it decelerated. Such low-frequency waves -- called infrasound -- are sometimes detected by cold-war era nuclear blast sensors in remote parts of the Pacific Ocean or Alaska, according to meteor experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waves can bounce off buildings and be stronger in some places than others; they can also resonate with glass, explaining why bottles and dishes might have shattered inside undamaged kitchens, as if crushed by the airy hand of the meteor itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A shock wave is like a ball,'' Aleksandr Y. Dudorov, director of the theoretical physics department at Chelyabinsk State University, said in an interview. ''Throw a ball into a room and it will bounce from one wall to another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has mobilized 24,000 emergency officials to inspect roads, railroads, hospitals, factories and military facilities. Most are undamaged, including 122 sites identified as particularly critical, including nuclear power plants, dams and chemical factories, and a space launching site called Strela.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Sunday, Russia's consumer safety inspection agency, <span class="companylink">Rospotrebnadzor</span>, released a statement saying the water in Lake Chebarkul, where a hole in the ice appeared on Friday, was not radioactive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unclear why the agency released this finding only Sunday, or whether the tests were conducted to assuage popular concerns or out of any real official uncertainty over what happened on Friday. In any case, the agency said a mobile laboratory quietly dispatched to the lake tested for but did not discover cesium 137 and strontium 90, isotopes created in nuclear explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrasound waves have not previously been studied in a cityscape, Richard P. Binzel, a professor of planetary science at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and an author of a textbook on asteroids and meteorites, said in a telephone interview. But he noted that the apparent randomness of the damage was consistent with the way such waves function.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A shock wave can be coming from a particular direction, and if you face that direction you are more susceptible,'' Dr. Binzel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One building might shadow another, or you may have a street that is optimally aligned to channel the wave, either in a fortunate or unfortunate way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Brown, a professor of physics at the University of Western Ontario, wrote in an e-mail that an infrasound wave ''is very efficient at traveling long distances,'' and that ''windows, structures or even glass jars susceptible to resonate at this frequency could be a factor to seemingly random damage at widely disparate locations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown studied a similar, though smaller, explosion of a meteor over the Pacific Ocean on Oct. 8, 2009, which also sent out low-frequency waves, though too remote to affect homes or industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were, though, registered by a network of infrasound sensors established to monitor compliance with the international ban on nuclear tests, according to Dr. Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alekdander V. Anusiyev, the spokesman for the governor of Chelyabinsk region, characterized the damage here as without a discernible pattern. ''It is impossible to say more glass broke in one part of the city or another,'' he said. ''Glass broke everywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roof of the zinc factory that collapsed was reinforced with a lattice of steel beams and supported by concrete joists that are now broken, jutting upward with mangled re-bar protruding. Windows on a neighboring house blew in with such force that the frames went with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet a few yards away on Sverdlovsky Street, the cosmos spared a seemingly vulnerable Hundai dealership, a three-story cube sheathed in glass, with glistening display models inside. Not a window broke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People can consider Feb. 15 their second birthday,'' the governor of Chelyabinsk, Mikhail Yurevich, told reporters, referring to the day of the meteor strike. ''God directed danger away.''</p>

Borchininova and several others in this run-down little town in the Siberian wilderness wandered outside, confused and curious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They followed the light's path to the town's lakefront, where they trudged for about a mile over the open ice until they came to a startling sight: a perfectly round hole, about 20 feet in diameter, its rim glossy with fresh ice that had crusted on top of the snow.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was eerie,'' Ms. Borchininova, a barmaid, said Saturday. ''So we stood there. And then somebody joked, 'Now the green men will crawl out and say hello.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russians are still coming to terms with what NASA scientists say was a 7,000-ton chunk of space rock that hurtled out of the sky at 40,000 miles an hour, exploding over the Ural Mountains, spraying debris for miles around and, amazingly, killing no one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Russian government pursued the scientific mysteries of the exploding meteor, sending divers through the hole and into the inky waters of Lake Chebarkul on Saturday, residents reacted with a kind of giddy relief and humor over their luck at having survived a cosmic near miss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA estimates that when the meteor entered the atmosphere over Alaska, it weighed 7,000 to 10,000 tons and was at least 50 feet in diameter, a size that strikes the Earth about once every hundred years, and that it exploded with the force of 500 kilotons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shock wave injured hundreds of people about 54 miles away in the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, most from broken glass; collapsed a wall in a zinc factory; set off car alarms; and sent dishes flying in thousands of apartments. Broken windows exposed people and pipes to the Siberian winter; many residents focused Saturday on boarding windows and draining pipes to preserve heating systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If pieces of meteorite reached the surface, as NASA said was likely, they fell largely into the sea of birch and pine trees in this patch of western Siberia, now blanketed in snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Chebarkul is one of four sites that the government believes felt a significant impact, the minister of emergency situations, Vladimir Puchkov, told the Interfax news agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the sun rose there on Saturday, the snow crystals sparkling like a million tiny mirrors, steam wafted from the ice crater, apparently related to the work of the divers, but the lake yielded few clues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puchkov later said the divers had found nothing on the lake bed, but had not ruled out meteor shrapnel as the cause of the hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Experts are studying all possible places of impact,'' he said. ''We have no reports of confirmed discoveries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A meteorite fragment could help scientists better apprehend the composition of the meteor, perhaps shedding light on how close it was to descending further before exploding from the heat or to hitting the surface. Such circumstances could have caused vastly more casualties in this rust-belt region of military and industrial towns, a major nuclear research site and waste repository, and other delicate infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chelyabinsk, the worst-hit town, most who sought medical attention had been released from hospitals by Saturday, the Ministry of Health reported. A total of 1,158 people, including 298 children, sought medical care. Of those, 52 were hospitalized. On Saturday afternoon, 12 adults and 3 children remained in hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials evacuated to Moscow a woman who had broken two vertebrae after falling down stairs. One man's finger was cut off by broken glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overshadowing these misfortunes, a fourth-grade teacher in Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, was being hailed as a hero for saving 44 children from glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks when she saw the flash. Having no idea what it was, she executed a duck-and-cover drill from the cold war era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Karbysheva, who remained standing, was seriously lacerated when glass severed a tendon in one of her arms, Interfax reported; not one of her students suffered a cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 32-second terminal plunge into Siberia, the meteor left a smoke contrail in the sky that twirled in a diabolical, turbulent wake. Some witnesses described an unbearably bright light, and the feeling of heat on their exposed faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tatyana N. Vasiliyeva, a retired accountant who was walking with her husband on the lakeshore here Friday morning, said she had looked up to see ''a star getting brighter, like the sun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a fiery star falling right on me,'' she said. ''And so I thought I should just close my eyes now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Saturday, she was back at the shore, giggly and disappointed that the police would not let her near the ice hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Russians found different meanings in the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hawkish deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin, suggested that the world's leading scientists develop a missile system to deflect asteroids from Earth. ''Today neither the United States nor Russia has the capability to shoot down such an object,'' he warned, according to Interfax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Church of the Transfiguration in Chebarkul, on a hill overlooking the lake, Deacon Sergiy was in mid-service on Friday, having just closed the doors in a wall of icons symbolizing the entombment of Jesus in the holy sepulcher and the imminence of the Resurrection. Just then, a bright light spilled in through every window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like a new sun was born,'' he said. ''This all gives us reason to think. Is the purpose of our life just to raise a family and die, or is it to live eternally? It was a reason for people on earth to look up, to look up at God.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the flash more significant than earlier signs he had noticed, like the time a white dove alighted on the church belfry, or when a cloud appeared above the church in the form of a cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the lake, an ice fisherman, who gave his name only as Dmitri, shrugged off the event. ''A meteor fell,'' he said. ''So what? Who knows what can fall out of the sky? It didn't hit anybody. That is the important thing,''</p>

But warnings that they lacked the tools to detect the most serious threats were largely ignored, even as skeptics mocked the worriers as Chicken Littles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more. The meteor that rattled Siberia on Friday, injuring hundreds of people and traumatizing thousands, has suddenly brought new life to efforts to deploy adequate detection tools, in particular a space telescope that would scan the solar system for dangers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who helped build thriving companies like <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has already put millions of dollars into the effort and saw Friday's shock wave as a turning point in raising hundreds of millions more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wouldn't it be silly if we got wiped out because we weren't looking?'' said Edward Lu, a former NASA astronaut and <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who leads the detection effort. ''This is a wake-up call from space. We've got to pay attention to what's out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers know of no asteroids or comets that pose a major threat to the planet. But NASA estimates that fewer than 10 percent of the big dangers have been discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu's group, called the B612 Foundation after the imaginary asteroid on which the Little Prince lived, is one team of several pursuing ways to ward off extraterrestrial threats. NASA is another, and other private groups are emerging, like Planetary Resources, which wants not only to identify asteroids near Earth but also to mine them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our job is to be the first line of defense, and we take that very seriously,'' James Green, the director of planetary science at NASA headquarters, said in an interview Friday after the Russian strike. ''No one living on this planet has ever before been hurt. That's historic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green added that the Russian episode was sure to energize the field and that an even analysis of the meteor's remains could help reveal clues about future threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our scientists are excited,'' he said. ''Russian planetary scientists are already collecting meteorites from this event.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow awakening to the danger began long ago, as scientists found hundreds of rocky scars indicating that cosmic intruders had periodically reshaped the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discoveries included not just obvious features like Meteor Crater in Arizona, but wide zones of upheaval. A crater more than a hundred miles wide beneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico suggested that, 65 million years ago, a speeding rock from outer space had raised enough planetary mayhem to end the reign of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people remain skeptical of the cosmic threat and are glad for taxpayer money to go toward urgent problems on Earth rather than outer space. But many scientists who have examined the issues have become convinced that better precautions are warranted in much the same way that homeowners buy insurance for unlikely events that can result in severe damage to life and property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, astronomers turned their telescopes on the sky with increasing vigor to look for killer rocks. The rationale was statistical. They knew about a number of near misses and calculated that many other rocky threats whirling about the solar system had gone undetected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, with little fanfare, the Air Force also began scanning the skies for speeding rocks, giving credibility to an activity once seen as reserved for doomsday enthusiasts. It was the world's first known government search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> took a lead role with what it called the Spaceguard Survey. In 2007, it issued a report estimating that 20,000 asteroids and comets orbited close enough to the planet to deliver blows that could destroy cities or even end all life. Today, with limited financing, NASA supports modest telescopes in the southwestern United States and in Hawaii that make more than 95 percent of the discoveries of the objects coming near the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists lobbied hard for a space telescope that would get high above the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere. It would orbit the Sun, peering across the solar system, and would have a much better chance of finding large space rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the nation immersed in two wars and other earthly priorities, the government financing never materialized. Last year, Dr. Lu, who left the NASA astronaut corps in 2007 to work for <span class="companylink">Google</span>, joined with veterans of the space program and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B612 Foundation refers to its planned telescope as the world's first private mission to deep space. Private groups, it says on its Web site, can carry out ''audacious projects that previously only governments could accomplish -- and at lower cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to launch a large telescope known as Sentinel that can find 90 percent of the asteroids larger than 460 feet in diameter that pass through the Earth's part of the solar system. They also want to discover smaller asteroids down to a diameter of 100 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such asteroids are much bigger than the meteor that hit the atmosphere over Russia, and the telescope would thus be blind to those kinds of smaller threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, the B612 Foundation, based in Mountain View, Calif., signed a contract with <span class="companylink">Ball Aerospace</span> to create prototype sensors for the Sentinel mission. The space telescope is to have a diameter of 20 inches. In theory, the system could be ready for launching by 2017 or 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Dr. Lu said the overall cost of the mission was now estimated at $450 million, including launching, insurance and operations. The group, far from that goal, has been soliciting money from citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's close approach to Earth of an asteroid named 2012 DA14, as well as the much smaller object whose shock wave broke windows and bones in Russia, prompted thousands of hits to the foundation's Web site and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account, said Diane Murphy, a spokeswoman for the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody is calling,'' she said. ''They see us as the solution. They're saying, 'When are you going to have the telescope up?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B612 is just one player. Last April, Planetary Resources unveiled plans to mine asteroids that zip close by Earth, both to provide supplies for future interplanetary travelers and to bring back metals like platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture attracted some big-name investors, including Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of <span class="companylink">Google</span>. The company also has plans to develop telescopes that would hunt for rocky intruders coming near the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green of NASA said the agency was preparing to launch a mission in 2016 that will fly to an asteroid and, in 2023, return a sample to Earth for detailed analyses. The insights are expected to help scientists learn more about the makeup of the threats whizzing through the cosmic shooting gallery.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor that exploded over Russia on Friday set off the largest explosion of its kind in more than a century, at least according to Western scientists. And even more unusual for a meteor, it caused numerous injuries, mostly from flying glass, as the shock wave violently jolted the city of Chelyabinsk below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hit on the same day that astronomers were watching another larger rock miss Earth by just 17,200 miles, and experts scrambled to understand the two rare cosmic events.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some initially speculated that Earth was passing through a swarm of asteroids, but the Russian meteor came from the other direction. ''There is no relation there,'' said Paul Chodas, a scientist with NASA's Near Earth Object Program. ''It seems like we're in a cosmic shooting gallery here. There were two very rare events happening on the same day. Pure coincidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on preliminary calculations, the solar system interloper that shook Chelyabinsk weighed about 7,000 tons and was about 50 feet in diameter when it entered the atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour at about 9:20 a.m. local time, said Peter G. Brown, a professor of physics at the University of Western Ontario. Dr. Brown based his calculations on low-frequency sound waves that traveled as far as Alaska. A worldwide network of such sensors listens for these vibrations, too low to be heard by humans, to verify the ban on nuclear tests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian experts estimated a much smaller size, of just 10 feet across and 10 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid streaked across the sky for about half a minute, unleashing thunderous sonic booms. (Asteroids are orbiting rocks usually between Mars and Jupiter; they are called meteors when they enter the Earth's atmosphere and begin burning up.) The meteor was likely made of stony materials and not solid metal, so as pressure from the atmosphere increased, it exploded at an altitude of 12 to 15 miles above the surface. It released the equivalent energy of 300,000 tons of TNT, Dr. Brown said, although he said that estimate could be revised higher, perhaps to 500,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima during World War II was the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the largest recorded event since the 1908 Tunguska event,'' Dr. Chodas said. On June 30, 1908, the explosion of a meteor, believed to be an asteroid, flattened millions of trees over 800 square miles in a remote, largely unhabited area of central Siberia about 1,200 miles away from Friday's event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a NASA news conference Friday afternoon, Bill Cooke, who leads the Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the orbital path of the meteor showed that it was an asteroid, not a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its farthest point from the Sun, it was 2.5 times as far away as the Earth, before its elliptical path took it closer, and the Earth got in its way on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large meteors could have splashed unnoticed in an ocean in decades past, but nowadays military satellites on the watch for missile launches would certainly notice an incoming meteor this bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid was impossible to detect, Dr. Cooke said, because it was approaching from the dayside. ''And as you know, telescopes can't see things during the daytime,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark R. Chapman, a senior scientist at the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Studies based in Boulder, Colo., said this was the first time a crashing meteor is known to have injured a large number of people. ''That's basically never happened before,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the emptiness of space, billions of rocks, from dust to those miles across, zip around the inner solar system, and collisions with the Earth's atmosphere are frequent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most are mere grains, burning up high in the atmosphere. Larger ones -- the size of peas -- can be spotted streaking across the night sky as ''shooting stars,'' but those also never reach the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small objects the size of a basketball hit the Earth almost every day, once a day on average, and car-size objects hit every month or two,'' Dr. Chodas said. ''Little stuff hits the Earth all the time. We just don't know about it. It's all burning up in the atmosphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists estimate that these tiny meteoritic bits add up to 80 tons of material falling on Earth from outer space each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant impacts have changed the course of life on Earth, notably 65 million years ago when an object several miles wide slammed off the coast of Mexico and killed off the dinosaurs. Collisions with objects the size of the Russian meteor or 2012DA14, the asteroid that did not hit Earth on Friday, occur perhaps once a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA surveys had cataloged 95 percent of near-Earth asteroids 0.6 miles wide or wider, but fewer of the smaller ones. A year ago, a telescope in Spain discovered 2012 DA14, a 150-foot-wide asteroid just after it made a somewhat close pass to Earth, missing by 1.6 million miles. With an orbital period of 366 days, it made a return visit on Friday, at a much closer distance of 17,200 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is closer than many telecommunications satellites. But despite needless anxiety that it would hit Earth, its passing was uneventful, and it will not come that close again until at least 2080.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If 2012 DA14 had collided with Earth, it would have released the energy of 2.5 million tons of TNT, NASA scientists estimate, or nearly 10 times as much energy as the meteor in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some estimates put the Tunguska event even bigger, perhaps 20 million tons of TNT. The makeup of an asteroid can vastly change the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Tunguska, the asteroid also exploded in the air. But in Arizona, an asteroid of similar energy, but made of nickel and iron, slammed into the ground about 50,000 years ago, leaving a crater 4,000 feet wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, astronomers do find the very small asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also had fortuitous luck in 2008 when they discovered an asteroid, smaller than the Russian one, and were able to track it as it entered the atmosphere over Sudan 20 hours later. But most of the time, near misses of objects that small are missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is detectable, but only if we are looking at the right place at precisely the right time,'' Dr. Chodas said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- Gym class came to a halt inside the Chelyabinsk Railway Institute, and students gathered around the window, gazing at the fat white contrail that arced its way across the morning sky. A missile? A comet? A few quiet moments passed. And then, with incredible force, the windows blew in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scenes from Chelyabinsk, rocked by an intense shock wave when a meteor hit the Earth's atmosphere Friday morning, offer a glimpse of an apocalyptic scenario that many have walked through mentally, and Hollywood has popularized, but scientists say has never before injured so many people.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students at the institute crammed through a staircase thickly blanketed with glass out to the street, where hundreds stood in awe, looking at the sky. The flash came in blinding white, so bright that the vivid shadows of buildings slid swiftly and sickeningly across the ground. It burst yellow, then orange. And then there was the sound of frightened, confused people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 1,200 people, 200 of them children, were injured, mostly by glass that exploded into schools and workplaces, according to <span class="companylink">Russia's Interior Ministry</span>. Others suffered skull trauma and broken bones. No deaths were reported. A city administrator in Chelyabinsk said that more than a million square feet of glass shattered, leaving many buildings exposed to icy cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as scientists tried to piece together the chain of events that led to Friday's disaster -- on the very day a small asteroid passed close to Earth -- residents of Chelyabinsk were left to grapple with memories that seemed to belong in science fiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I opened the window from surprise -- there was such heat coming in, as if it were summer in the yard, and then I watched as the flash flew by and turned into a dot somewhere over the forest,'' wrote Darya Frenn, a blogger. ''And in several seconds there was an explosion of such force that the window flew in along with its frame, the monitor fell, and everything that was on the desk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''God forbid you should ever have to experience anything like this,'' she wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 9 a.m., the sun had just risen on the Ural Mountains, which form a ridge between European Russia and the vast stretch of Siberia to the east. The area around Chelyabinsk is a constellation of defense industry manufacturing cities, including some devoted to developing and producing nuclear weapons. The factory towns are separated by great expanses of uninhabited forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As residents of Chelyabinsk began their day on Friday, a 10-ton meteor around 10 feet in diameter was hurtling toward the Earth at a speed of about 10 to 12 miles per second, experts from the Russian Academy of Sciences reported in a statement released Friday. Scientists believe the meteor exploded upon hitting the lower atmosphere and disintegrated at an altitude of about 20 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface -- not an especially unusual event, the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This meteor was unusual because its material was so hard -- it may have been made of iron, the statement said -- which allowed some small fragments, or meteorites, perhaps 5 percent of the meteor's mass, to reach the Earth's surface. Nothing similar has been recorded in Russian territory since 2002, the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of the meteor's size varied considerably. Peter G. Brown, a physics professor and director of the Center for Planetary Science and Exploration at the University of Western Ontario, said it was closer to 50 feet in diameter and probably weighed around 7,000 tons. He said the energy released by the explosion was equivalent to 300 kilotons of TNT, making it the largest recorded since the 1908 Tunguska explosion in Siberia, which is believed to have been caused by an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteors typically cause sonic booms when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, and the one that occurred over Chelyabinsk was forceful enough to shatter dishes and televisions in people's homes. Car alarms were triggered for miles around, and the roof of a zinc factory partially collapsed. Video clips, uploaded by the hundreds starting early Friday morning, showed ordinary mornings interrupted by a blinding flash and the sound of shattering glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Polyakova, 25, head of reception at the Park-City Hotel in Chelyabinsk, said it was the light that caught her eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw a flash in the window, turned toward it and saw a burning cloud, which was surrounded by smoke and was going downward -- it reminded me of what you see after an explosion,'' she said. The blast that followed was forceful enough to shatter the heavy automatic glass doors on the hotel's first floor, as well as many windows on the floor above, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valentina Nikolayeva, a teacher in Chelyabinsk, described it as ''an unreal light'' that filled all the classrooms on one side of School No. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a light which never happens in life; it happens probably only in the end of the world,'' she said in a clip posted on a news portal, LifeNews.ru. She said she saw a vapor trail, like one that appears after an airplane, only dozens of times bigger. ''The light was coming from there. Then the light went out, and the trail began to change. The changes were taking place within it, like in the clouds, because of the wind. It began to shrink and then, a minute later, an explosion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A shock wave,'' she said. ''It was not clear what it was, but we were deafened at that moment. The window glass flew.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strange light had drawn many to the windows, the single most dangerous place to be. Tyoma Chebalkin, a student at Southern Urals State University, said that the shock wave traveled from the western side the city, and that anyone standing close to windows -- security guards at their posts, for instance -- was caught in a hail of broken glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke to Vozhd.info, an online news portal, four hours after the explosion, when cellphones, which had been knocked out, were still out of order. He said that traffic was at a standstill in the city center, and that everyone he could see was trying to place calls. He said he saw no signs of panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those strange hours, Ms. Frenn, the blogger, wrote down the thoughts that had raced through her mind -- radiation, a plane crash, the beginning of a war -- and noted that her extremities went numb while she was waiting to hear that the members of her family were unhurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When emergency officials announced that what had occurred was a meteor, what occurred to her was: It could happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am at home, whole and alive,'' she wrote. ''I have gathered together my documents and clothes. And a carrier for the cats. Just in case.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the detailed video images viewed around the world on Friday showing the explosive meteor in Russia can be traced to what may seem like an unlikely source: the country's reputation for crazy motorists, stupefying traffic accidents and corrupt police officers. This has led many drivers in Russia to install dashboard cameras, which document every minute on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The streaking flash of the meteor as it burned up over a swath of central and eastern Russia came during part of the morning rush-hour commute in the city of Chelyabinsk and other populated areas. Disbelieving motorists who caught the footage on their dashboard cameras quickly uploaded it on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capturing cosmic events on video, however, is not the primary purpose of dashboard cameras in Russia, where they have become almost standard equipment for vehicles in recent years in order to prove innocence in traffic accidents. They have also spawned a sort-of mini industry in voyeuristic Internet entertainment on their own for chronicling the dangers of driving in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> ''Russian traffic violence'' or ''Russian traffic accidents'' to find a litany of motorist chutzpah, ranging from deadly hit-and-runs to crowbar assaults between angry drivers, sometimes in the middle of busy highways. The problem was highlighted by then-President Dmitri A. Medvedev a few years ago, in remarks before the permanent members of <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> Security Council in which he castigated the ''undisciplined, criminally careless behavior of our drivers'' for what seemed an epidemic of road mayhem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving in Russia can be especially challenging because of poorly maintained roads, vast lawless areas and the unsavory reputation of the traffic police, who have been ranked in Russian opinion polls as among the most corrupt officials in the country. Insurance is costly and judges prefer to see visual proof of a motorist's damage claims. Hence the prevalence of dashboard cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hazards were perhaps most succinctly explained last June by Marina Galperina, a Russian expatriate and an editor-blogger for the ANIMALNewYork Web site, who wrote about the ubiquity of Russian dashboard cameras in a blog post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Russia, everyone should have a camera on their dashboard,'' she wrote. ''It's better than keeping a lead pipe under your seat for protection (but you might still want that lead pipe.'')</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDLife is scariest when it imitates science fiction. The stunning video of the meteor that whistled and boomed across Russian skies on Friday unnerved even those with long experience imagining catastrophic events. Past and present practitioners of fantasy fiction in print and movies reacted to the views with awe -- and some new ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of the time we can forget the universe, frankly,'' said Stephen Baxter, president of the British Science Fiction Association and the author of books like ''Space'' and ''Last and First Contacts.'' ''But today, there was 'a crack in the sky and a hand reaching down,' to quote David Bowie. It reminds us of our true location, so to speak.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some on Friday were moved to recall the Tunguska Event of 1908, in which a vast tract in Siberia was flattened, apparently by an airburst from a low-passing asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a much smaller event, but a Tunguska-sized event would vaporize 900 square miles of land,'' said the journalist and fiction writer Tom Bissell, whose 2003 essay ''A Comet's Tale'' investigated end-of-the-world possibilities. ''Can you imagine that happening above a major metropolitan area? It would either fill the churches or empty the churches.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a decade before Tunguska, H. G. Wells published ''The Star,'' in which people helplessly watch as a star nears Earth, causing vast disruptions to the planet but never directly striking it. We are slightly less helpless now, Mr. Baxter said, as we track asteroids more closely and continue to research ways to divert potential party-crashers. But his optimism is the cautious kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we got overconfident in the 1990s,'' with movies like ''Armageddon'' and ''Deep Impact,'' ''when we thought we could fend off any threat,'' he said. ''H. G. Wells knew we couldn't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''A Comet's Tale,'' Mr. Bissell spoke to an astronomer who had ''stopped reading the sci-fi novels he loved as a teenager when the science he was involved in became more interesting to him than fantasy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for filmmakers, fantasy trumps reality, even when they turn their lens, as they have more recently, to the quotidian side of apocalypse from above. ''Seeking a Friend for the End of the World'' uses a pending asteroid collision to pair up Steve Carell and Keira Knightley on a road trip. In Lars von Trier's ''Melancholia,'' two sisters, played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg, try to sort out their lives before the celestial credits roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For others, meteors suggest more outlandish scenarios. Damon Lindelof, a producer and co-writer of the coming ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' and a co-creator of ''Lost,'' imagined being in a meeting with a studio chief on Friday morning and asked on the spot to come up with an idea for a movie tied to the meteor event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My pitch would start by focusing on the lie,'' he said. ''The scientific community, particularly NASA, insists that the meteor that just exploded over Russia has nothing to do with the asteroid hurtling toward Earth -- lies, all lies. Actually, that Russian explosion was an extraterrestrial mortar shell fired from multiple galaxies away as an attempt to divert the asteroid and save Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paused for a moment for dramatic effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, the twist is that these aliens want to enslave us, and Earth is useless to them if it's destroyed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can do better than that,'' said Dave Howe, president of the Syfy channel, after being told of Mr. Lindelof's idea. ''Imagine if that asteroid has dragon eggs inside it,'' he said. ''Add in some low-budget special effects and it would be a classic Syfy Saturday night movie,'' referring to his network's franchise that pushes the B-movie genre to its limit, mashing up disasters and mutated animals into films like ''Arachnoquake,'' about fire-breathing spiders that come to life after a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But who would save the day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly President Putin,'' Mr. Howe said, meaning the Russian leader Vladimir V. ''Only he would come to the rescue on horseback because the asteroid has knocked all the power out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along similar lines, Micho Rutare, the director and co-writer of the 2010 movie ''Meteor Apocalypse,'' imagined a satire in which an asteroid has an electromagnetic effect that knocks out cellphones. ''Imagine the horror and terror,'' he said. ''People would have to actually have conversations in person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jokes aside, Mr. Bissell said he was glad we had not had an even more dangerous event. ''Asteroids are bad, but comets are the worst,'' he said, ''because all of mass extinction on this planet has probably been tied to massive comet impacts. Asteroids go around in a very predictable orbit. Comets can come from so distant in the galaxy, you only figure out where they're going when they go past you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: February 20, 2013, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the reactions of practitioners of fantasy fiction to the exploding meteor over Russia omitted two reporting credits.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON Feb. 15, an asteroid designated 2012 DA14 will pass safely within about 17,200 miles of Earth's surface -- closer than the communication satellites that will be broadcasting the news of its arrival. The asteroid is about 150 feet in diameter and has a mass estimated at about 143,000 tons.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should an object of that size hit Earth, it would cause a blast with the energy equivalent of about 2.4 million tons -- or 2.4 megatons -- of TNT explosives, more than 180 times the power of the atomic blast that leveled Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's almost as if nature is firing a shot across our bow to direct our attention to the vast number of nearby rocky asteroids and a few icy comets that make up what we call the near-Earth object population. We should take the warning seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no known asteroids or comets represent a worrisome impact threat now, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory shows more than two dozen asteroids have better than a one in a million chance of smacking into Earth within the next 100 years. That may sound reassuring, but we estimate that less than 10 percent of all near-Earth objects have been discovered. And while we are keeping a vigilant eye out for these objects in the Northern Hemisphere, we are considerably less watchful in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been only within the last 15 years that astronomers, mostly supported by NASA, have begun discovering the vast number of near-Earth objects. Our findings have led us to the realization that Earth runs its course around the sun in a cosmic shooting gallery -- with us as the target. Basketball-size rocky objects enter Earth's atmosphere daily and <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>-size objects every few months, but they burn up before they hit the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Objects larger than about 100 feet in diameter, the size of a large house, strike Earth with an average interval of a few hundred years. The last one of about this size to hit was on June 30, 1908, in a sparsely populated region of Siberia called Tunguska. The Tunguska blast released about four megatons of energy and leveled millions of trees across 825 square miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A much larger asteroid or comet, six miles in diameter, collided with Earth some 65 million years ago, killing most of the large vertebrates, including the dinosaurs. Fortunately, Earth collisions with objects so big happen only at average intervals of 100 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can be done if a rogue asteroid is judged to be on a trajectory that threatens Earth? Our best option would be to send a spacecraft to collide with the asteroid and modify its trajectory to ensure that the Earth is missed by a wide margin. We have the technology to do this -- and, in fact, did it in 2005, when we intentionally slammed a spacecraft into the comet Tempel-1. As the science fiction author Larry Niven once said, the dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2010, President Obama called upon NASA to send a human mission to an asteroid by 2025 as a steppingstone for the much more difficult human exploration of Mars. The technologies and life support systems needed for the Mars expedition could be tested first at a nearby asteroid with the round trip taking only a few months instead of a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUITE apart from their menacing reputations or as steppingstones to Mars, near-Earth objects are important in their own right. They are the leftover bits and pieces from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago, so they provide insights into the original chemical mix and environment of our nascent solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may also have played a key role in how life arose on Earth. Asteroids and comets most likely brought to the earth much of the water and carbon-based materials that allowed life to form more than 3.5 billion years ago. Subsequent impacts then punctuated evolution, allowing only the most adaptable species to evolve further. Remember the dinosaurs? We mammals may owe our very existence and our position atop the food chain to near-Earth objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are compelling reasons to use these objects as sources of raw materials for the future construction of space habitats and supply depots. They are rich in minerals, metals and platinum-group elements, and their clays and ices could provide water resources. (Within the last year, two United States companies, Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, announced plans to mine asteroids for their resources.) The water could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, the most efficient form of rocket fuel. Near-Earth objects may serve as the watering holes and fueling stations for interplanetary exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll also need to continue to aggressively discover and track them, if we are to be assured of having a future as a species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three NASA-supported observatories with modest telescopes in the southwestern United States and in Hawaii are making more than 95 percent of near-Earth object discoveries. Because of budget limitations, an observatory at Siding Spring, Australia, the only one looking for these objects in the Southern Hemisphere, has reduced its operations to only occasional observations, leaving a blind spot for unknown objects approaching from the southern skies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ground-based observatories will always be important as we follow these intriguing objects. But a space-based, wide field-of-view telescope operating in the more sensitive infrared light wavebands is the best way to find the majority of hazardous asteroids within the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA and its domestic and international partners need to be allowed to redouble the search for near-Earth objects with more powerful search telescopes, both ground-based and space-based, so we are not caught off guard. We need to find them before they find us.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea succeeded in thrusting a satellite into orbit for the first time on Wednesday, joining an elite club of space technology leaders seven weeks after the successful launching of a satellite by its rival, North Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea has attached an intense national pride to the 140-ton, 108-foot-tall Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or KSLV-1, which was built with the help of Russian technology. Feeling behind China and Japan, both of which have successful space programs, South Korea has sought a technological prowess of its own.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That task gained more urgency after North Korea launched a long-range rocket on Dec. 12 that put a satellite into orbit, after earlier failures. Only a handful of countries have succeeded in independently launching satellites into orbit, with Iran also recently joining the club. After studying the debris of the North Korean rocket, which splashed into South Korean waters, officials here determined that North Korea, despite its backward economy, had built key parts of its rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all major South Korean television stations broadcasting live, the two-stage rocket blasted off from the newly built Naro Space Center in Goheung, 200 miles south of Seoul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After analyzing the data, we determined that our satellite entered its intended orbit,'' Lee Ju-ho, the minister of education, science and technology, said during a nationally televised news conference. ''Today, we took a leap toward becoming a power in space technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although part of the two-stage rocket was built by the Russians, South Korea sees the successful launching as having given it an important toehold in space technology, the latest high-tech market where the country has decided to become a player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful launching comes at a delicate time on the Korean Peninsula, as North Korea, stung by new international sanctions over its own rocket launching, has promised a nuclear test. The United Nations has banned North Korea, which has an active nuclear arms program, from ballistic missile tests; the West considers the launching a test of that technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea previously fired a KSLV-1 rocket twice from Goheung, first in 2009 and again in 2010, but each time, the rocket failed to put a satellite into orbit. This was the third effort, initially scheduled for October, but it had been twice delayed at the last minute because of technical glitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, South Korea's space ambitions have languished under the constraints of agreements with the United States, which feared that a robust rocket program might be transferred to the building of missiles and help accelerate a regional arms race.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian state television said Monday that the nation had put a monkey into space ''as a prelude to sending humans.'' The successful flight involved a relatively small rocket that went straight up and down, according to the state-sponsored news report, and the monkey survived the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western experts said the brief experiment appeared to have few if any immediate military implications, as it might have if Iran had launched a much larger vehicle that could fly high and fast enough to put a major payload into orbit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't demonstrate any militarily significant technology,'' said Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks rocket launchings and space activity. ''This is a tiny old rocket, and what's on top is useful only for doing astronaut stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, he and other experts said, the exercise seemed to represent a small but significant step in Iran's stated goal of developing rockets big and advanced enough to send human astronauts into space -- a goal Tehran has repeated publicly for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at a private research group, GlobalSecurity.org, in Alexandria, Va., said that the flight, if truly successful, showed that Iran was slowly mastering the technology of life support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's significant in that it shows progress toward manned spaceflight,'' he said in an interview. But Mr. Vick urged caution about the Iranian claims, noting that news media reports suggested that Iran in 2011 had tried and failed to put a monkey into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think they messed up,'' he said of the reported failure, conceding that other Western experts disagreed on whether Iran had in fact tried to launch a monkey earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James E. Oberg, a former NASA engineer and author of a dozen books on human spaceflight, said Iran's civil space advances also had propaganda value, since the peaceful flights could take global attention off the nation's military feats and ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To a large degree, it's a fig leaf,'' he said in an interview. ''Like the North Koreans, they get to present their program as peaceful when lots of it has to do with weapons development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, space powers have lofted ants, spiders, mice, rats, frogs, snails, fish, turtles, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, monkeys and chimpanzees as cover stories for military programs and as high-flying experiments meant to pave the way for sending humans into orbit. Iran in recent years has said it has launched a mouse, a turtle and a number of worms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a question of testing life-support reliability for people,'' Mr. Oberg said. ''Things in zero gravity don't always behave like they do in test chambers on earth. It's prudent to look for things you might have overlooked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the military side, Iran has tested and fielded a growing arsenal of powerful missiles that now threaten Israel and limited parts of Europe. In 2009 and 2011, it successfully put satellites into orbit. Aerospace experts say the orbital steps can help Iran develop long-range missiles that one day might target the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran is also pursuing a program to enrich uranium, which can fuel reactors or nuclear warheads atop missiles. For many years, Western powers have failed to persuade Iran to abandon the sprawling effort, which they see as aimed at making nuclear arms. Iran has denied that charge and insists its goals are entirely peaceful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Iran's Press TV, a state-run broadcaster, said the monkey had been launched in a space capsule code named Pishgam, or Pioneer. It quoted the director of the Iran Space Agency, Hamid Fazeli, as saying this month that ''because of biological similarities between humans and monkeys, the latter were selected for the space mission.'' He also predicted that Iran would send a human into space within the ''next five to eight years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western space experts could give no confirmation of the report, which Press TV called evidence of ''yet another'' Iranian achievement in launching animals into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state news agency, IRNA, said the monkey rode on a Kavoshgar rocket that reached an altitude of 75 miles and ''returned its shipment intact,'' Reuters reported. The monkey survived, Press TV said. The timing of the reported launching was unclear -- either on Monday or within the past few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report emerged as Western officials in Brussels said they had offered Iran new dates in February to resume the long-running and inconclusive nuclear talks, Reuters reported. Iranian officials reportedly turned down a request for a meeting in Istanbul at the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vick of GlobalSecurity.org said Iran's program for human spaceflight was apparently making progress not only in launching animals into space but in developing large new rockets and launching facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, he said, Iran unveiled information about a space capsule meant to hold human astronauts. ''It's based on Chinese technology,'' Mr. Vick said, adding that Iran had nearly completed a large new launching pad big enough for powerful rockets that could loft warheads, satellites or people into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's nearly done,'' Mr. Vick said of the launching facility. ''It's for the big new launcher they're building.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHETHER in Davos or almost anywhere else that leaders are discussing the world's problems, they are missing by far the biggest issue: the rapidly deteriorating global environment and its ability to support civilization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is pretty much an endgame. Unless pressing issues of the biology of the planet and of climate change generated by greenhouse gas emissions are addressed with immediacy and at appropriate scale, the matters that occupy Davos discussions will be seen in retrospect as largely irrelevant.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, in Bonn, out of sight and out of mind, international negotiators will design the biodiversity and ecosystem equivalent to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A full eight years have passed since President Jacques Chirac of France acted as host at a meeting in Paris to create this ''Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress has been painfully slow. Only now is the ''platform'' and its work program -- to assess status, trends and possible solutions -- being designed. In the meantime, rates of extinction and endangerment of species have soared. Ecosystem destruction is massive and accelerating. Institutional responsiveness seems lethargic to a reptilian degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is abundantly clear that the target of a 2-degree Celsius limit to climate change was mostly derived from what seemed convenient and doable without any reference to what it really means environmentally. Two degrees is actually too much for ecosystems. Tropical coral reefs are extremely vulnerable to even brief periods of warming. The elevated atmospheric CO2 also has raised the acidity of the oceans, which affects the ability of coral and mollusks such as oysters to build shells and skeletons. A 2-degree world will be one without coral reefs (on which millions of human beings depend for their well-being).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current global warming of 0.8-0.9 degrees, the fingerprints of climate change can be seen virtually everywhere in nature. The coniferous forests of western North America are currently experiencing massive tree mortality because climate change has tipped the balance in favor of native bark beetles. The Amazon seems to be edging close to dieback in the southern and southeastern portions of the great forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At essentially double that current temperature increase, there undoubtedly will be massive extinctions and widespread ecosystem collapse. The difficulty of trying to buffer and manage change will increase exponentially with only small increments of warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the last time the planet was 2 degrees warmer, the oceans were four to six (perhaps eight) meters higher. We may not know how fast that will happen (although it is already occurring more rapidly than initially estimated), but the end point in sea-level rise is not in question. A major portion of humanity lives in coastal areas and small island states that will go under water. The site of the Earth Summit and Rio+20 will disappear under water fairly early on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a 2-degree increase should be unimaginable. Yet to stop at 2 degrees, global emissions have to peak in 2016. The Carbon Tracker organization has examined fossil-fuel investments around the world (including 1,200 new coal plants) and determined that they would lead to a 6-degree world. A recent <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> report indicates the bank cannot fulfill its development mission in a 4-degree world. Given what we know about planetary biology, 2 degrees seems nightmarish as it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what to do? The first thing is to recognize both the climate and biodiversity agenda as deadly important, of utmost urgency and fundamental to the future of humanity. The second is to find ways to keep temperature increase below 1.5 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those is to use the biology of our planet to pull about half a degree of warming potential out of the atmosphere before that potential is realized. Lag times between attaining an atmospheric CO2 concentration and the consequent heat accumulation make this possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, because all living things are built of carbon, restoring ecosystems (e.g., reforestation and restoration of grasslands) can recapture carbon lost to the atmosphere through past deforestation and ecosystem degradation. Ecosystem restoration has multiple benefits, including better grazing and enhanced soil fertility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simultaneously, we need to identify ways to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere nonbiologically. There already are ways to burn carbon-based fuels and capture the CO2 before it leaves chimneys. Better yet would be to find ways to pull CO2 from the atmosphere that are economic, even with the lower atmospheric concentrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Geoengineering'' schemes to reduce planetary temperature rather than atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be avoided. They only address the symptom (temperature) to the neglect of the cause (elevated greenhouse gas levels). As a consequence they are mostly irrelevant, dangerous and do nothing to reduce ocean acidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental change is happening rapidly and exponentially. We are out of time. Only three generations back -- in the same decade as the original scientific publication of the greenhouse effect -- my great-grandfather chaired the commission that designed the New York subway system. How was he to anticipate the sea-level rise that contributed in part to the impact of Hurricane Sandy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How will things look just two or three generations ahead? Can we avoid the greatest intergenerational environmental injustice of all time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June the intergovernmental process of Rio+20 proved to be monumentally disappointing. Happily, the <span class="companylink">Convention on Biological Diversity</span> is invigorated by new leadership and, among other things, has called for a ''concerted effort on ecosystem restoration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, inadequate funding nips at its heels. While there is some welcome private sector interest, what is needed is a world in which governments face the environmental challenge squarely, and truly lead. The current mode of nibbling around the edges is pretty much pointless.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of metal, its walls will be made of floppy cloth, making it easier to launch (and then inflate).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said Wednesday that it had signed a $17.8 million contract with <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> to build the module, which could reach the space station as soon as 2015. That is a bargain-basement price compared with most equipment the United States and other countries send into space, and the Bigelow agreement could serve as a model for how NASA puts together missions at lower costs by using a Kmart strategy: buying off-the-shelf pieces instead of developing its own designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This program starts a relationship that we think, and we hope, is going to be meaningful between NASA and ourselves,'' Robert T. Bigelow, the chief executive of Bigelow Aerospace, said at a news conference here at the company's headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-Earth orbit, he said, is the ''first target,'' but larger modules could be used for stations in deep space or for habitats on the Moon. ''We have ambitions to get to the Moon someday, to have a base there,'' Mr. Bigelow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fold-up, blow-up approach solves the conundrum of how to build something voluminous that can be packed into the narrow payload confines of a rocket. The soft sides of the module, called the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam, will allow it to be scrunched like a T-shirt in a suitcase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the space station, it will be attached to an air lock and then inflated like a balloon and expanded by a factor of 10 to its full size -- about 13 feet long and 10 feet in diameter, with about 560 cubic feet of space inside. At least initially, it will remain empty as NASA gathers data about its characteristics, including temperature and protection against micrometeorites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balloonlike structure is carefully designed not to pop. The fabric walls will consist of several layers including Vectran, a bullet-resistant material. Even if punctured by a high-speed meteorite, the fabric does not tear. A hole in a metal structure in space, by comparison, can cause explosive decompression as air rushes out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Beam module reaches the space station, astronauts might go to it to seek solitude: engineers expect it will be the quietest spot there. The fabric walls absorb sound vibrations instead of transmitting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beam revives a concept that NASA developed more than a decade ago for an inflatable four-story crew quarters on the space station. Congress halted the work as the station's construction costs grew sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow, who made a fortune in construction and hotels, licensed the technology from NASA and set up his factory here in North Las Vegas, investing more than $250 million of his own money. The company has already launched two unmanned prototypes into orbit, showing that they can remain inflated for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Beam is successful, NASA will probably incorporate the technology into any manned mission to an asteroid or elsewhere in the solar system, or to build a base on the Moon or Mars. Inflatables could also overturn notions of what a spacecraft ought to look like: Instead of the sleek, shiny machines imagined in science fiction, the practical ones of the future may be blobby, soft-sided contraptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow holds space ambitions of his own. His company is building two much larger inflatable modules, each with 11,600 cubic feet of space, to launch as the world's first private space station, docked together as station Alpha. The plan is to lease space on Alpha to countries that want to set up low-cost space programs and companies that want to conduct zero-gravity research. Tourists might be invited, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, Mr. Bigelow announced prices for travelers to his space station: $26.25 million for a 60-day stay, including the ride to orbit atop a Falcon 9 rocket built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. If the traveler wished to book the rocket ride in a more expensive capsule under development by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, the cost would be about $10 million more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow said the pieces of his private space station would be ready for business as soon as other companies were able to provide the rocket transportation for the people going up and down. The Beam module is a variation of earlier designs, allowing Bigelow to set a fixed price for NASA. With most of its development programs, NASA pays the contractor for time and effort -- and overruns. With the fixed-price contract, if Bigelow runs into obstacles, the company, not NASA, will absorb the additional costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For pennies on the dollar, NASA will be able to test a technology that could have implications for future exploration,'' said Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator. ''It represents a new way of doing business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Bigelow succeeds not only at building inflatable structures, but also at juggling the logistics of operating and supplying a space station, its private stations could soon overshadow the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Bigelow station, which could be in orbit by late 2016, would be large enough to house a dozen people, twice as many as the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company intends to build additional ones to meet demand, and it has already begun designing an enormous module with 74,000 cubic feet of space.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the parent of teenage boys who have to be dragged out of bed on school days, I had been looking forward to earlier sunrises once the winter solstice was past. But early January mornings seemed darker than ever while at the same time, the sky was clearly lighter around 5 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out that what I suspected was actually true -- by Jan. 2, there were 12 more minutes of sunlight in the afternoons, but 3 fewer minutes in the morning. It also turned out that the reasons for it were complicated, as I discovered in a series of phone and e-mail conversations with Jay M. Pasachoff, a professor of astronomy at Williams College, and a former student of his, Joseph Gangestad, who received his Ph.D. in orbital mechanics from Purdue.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They pointed me to the Equation of Time, a grandly named formula relating to the fact that not all days are 24 hours, if you track noon by the position of the Sun instead of on a clock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've all seen a readout of the Equation of Time, Dr. Pasachoff said. It's that uneven figure 8 that can be found on globes in a deserted part of the Pacific, a shape known as an analemma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Earth's axis were perpendicular to its orbit instead of tilted, and if its orbit were a circle instead of an ellipse, the Sun would appear in the same spot in the sky each day and clocks and sundials would always match. Instead, they can be as much as 16 minutes apart, and that's where things get complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Earth moves toward winter solstice, you have ''different things going on at the same time,'' Dr. Pasachoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth's tilt means that every day during the fall, the angle at which we view the Sun changes. It appears farther south and travels a shorter arc across the sky, affecting sunrise and sunset equally, and making the day shorter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in the solar time follow a different cycle. In the early 1600s, Kepler discovered that planets move faster at the part of their orbit that is closest to the sun, the perihelion. For Earth, perihelion comes a little after the winter solstice, so from November on, Earth is accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increased speed means we reach the Sun's maximum a little earlier each day, which pushes solar noon backward against clock time. That shift is amplified because the Sun is traveling a little south each day, while clocks only count its east to west traverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add it all together and you get sunrise and sunset times that are not symmetrical. In the weeks before the winter solstice, sunrise is being pushed later by both the changing angle of the Sun and the slowing of solar time. But sunset is being pushed in both directions -- earlier by the Sun's angle and later by the change in solar time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is more darkness in the morning and less in the afternoon. That's why the earliest sunset of 2012, at 4:29 p.m., in New York fell as soon as Nov. 30, according to the <span class="companylink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>'s solar calculator, while mornings continued to stay dark later. After the solstice, Earth continued its acceleration until reaching perihelion on Jan. 2. So the sunrise continued to slide, reaching its latest point, 7:20 a.m., on Dec. 28. There it stood until Jan. 11, when we finally got another minute of morning light. By Feb. 7, sunrise will be all the way back to 7 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to wrap the mind around this problem, which is really a figment of our timekeeping system,'' Dr. Gangestad said. That is, we would never notice it if we all just used sundials.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To promote a new line of products called Apollo, the <span class="companylink">Unilever</span> brand will send 22 consumers into space. The former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, hired as a spokesman, announced the contest at a private media event at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan on Wednesday evening.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brand refers to the effort as the Axe Apollo Space Academy, or AASA, meant to rhyme with NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Axe is contracting with the Space Expedition Corporation, which plans to begin conducting commercial flights on Lynx, a suborbital space plane, in 2014. The Lynx, which is being developed by <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>, will take off and land horizontally, like an airplane, and use rocket power to blast into space. It seats only the pilot and one passenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Space Expedition Corporation, which reports having already sold more than 200 tickets for future spaceflights, usually charges $100,000 for each flight that Axe is giving away. Flights are planned to last about an hour, reach an altitude of 64 miles, and provide a weightlessness experience of about five to six minutes before the Lynx descends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flights will be from Curaçao, an island off the Venezuelan coast. In a promotion for the sitcom ''The Big Bang Theory'' last July, CBS awarded a single ticket for a spaceflight on a Lynx space plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept for the Axe promotion, and a campaign including television commercials, is by the London office of <span class="companylink">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</span>. In a commercial, a buff firefighter rescues a beautiful woman from a burning building. After they reach safety, they stand near the burning building, and the woman stares longingly into his eyes. Then, in the distance, she sees an astronaut in a spacesuit walking toward her, and she ditches the firefighter to run toward the astronaut. The text on the screen: ''Nothing beats an astronaut. Ever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A voice-over directs viewers to AxeApollo.com to enter the contest. ''Axe Apollo Space Academy,'' continues the voice-over. ''Leave a man. Come back a hero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial was introduced online on Wednesday, and will begin appearing widely on television on Feb. 4, in rotation with another Apollo commercial that will be introduced during the Super Bowl on Feb. 3. This will be Axe's first time advertising during the Super Bowl, where 30-second spots this year are estimated to cost an average of $3.7 million to $3.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Axe spaceflight promotion, rather than marketers coming up with a prize suitable for a specific product, it was the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Kolbusz, a creative director at <span class="companylink">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</span>, said that about a year ago his agency was considering ideas to promote the entire Axe brand, not just one fragrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was just a notion that Axe as a brand has always been about giving men confidence, and we also settled on this idea of women loving a hero and the universality of an astronaut as a hero,'' Mr. Kolbusz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that space tourism is beginning to capture attention, with companies including Virgin Galactic (started by Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span>), the agency began exploring the possibility of giving away rides on flights to Axe users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Axe also was developing an unnamed fragrance. To align it with a nascent space promotion, the company decided to name the fragrance Apollo, after the American program dedicated to landing astronauts on the moon in the 1960s and '70s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was just a lovely symbiosis between the two things,'' said Mr. Kolbusz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew McCarthy, senior director of brand development for Axe in North America, said that marketing for Axe consistently takes ''truths about guys and girls and attraction and finds interesting and relevant ways to bring those to life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partnering with Mr. Aldrin and sending Axe users to space will resonate as ''a timeless theme about heroes and men,'' Mr. Kolbusz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brand reports that the campaign will be the most expensive for Axe, which was introduced in France 1983 and in the United States in 2002, but declined to provide specific figures. Axe spent $53.7 million on advertising in the United States in 2011, down from $92.7 million in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Axe Apollo, which began appearing in stores this month, is being introduced as a scented line across a variety of grooming products, including body spray, deodorant, shower gel and shampoo. Most have a suggested retail price of $4.30, and shampoo retails for $5.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To enter the contest, which will be promoted in 60 countries in about 45 languages, contestants will complete what the brand is calling an astronaut profile detailing why they should be chosen. Based on popular votes, the brand will send 100 to 105 finalists from throughout the world to a space camp in Orlando, Fla., for three days of training and testing. The brand and expedition company will choose 21 winners from that group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 22nd ticket will be awarded directly to a United States resident in a sweepstakes from Jan. 9 through Feb. 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an online-only video, Mr. Aldrin discusses his own space mission 44 years ago and promotes the Axe flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now you can become part of this privileged group and experience everything that I have,'' Mr. Aldrin says.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the delight of American satellite makers, communications satellites -- which orbit Earth to relay phone calls, link ships to shore and broadcast television programs -- will become legal for civilian export under legislation that President Obama signed into law on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the United States founded the industry, manufacturers were forced to pull back from international markets after a 1999 law categorized the satellites as weapons and restricted their export. At the time, Congress was fearful that selling satellites abroad could allow technology secrets to fall into the wrong hands.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defense bill that President Obama signed will undo that step and let American companies sell communications satellites as civilian technology rather than as deadly arms. Among the beneficiaries will be companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, Hughes and <span class="companylink">Space Systems/Loral</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a tremendous assist for an industry that is inherently international,'' said Patricia A. Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, a business group in Washington. ''It will ensure our place at the forefront of space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a practical matter, communications satellites made their debut in 1964 and quickly became stars of the space age. The first craft, orbiting at 22,300 miles, relayed signals to the United States from Japan that let American television viewers watch live coverage of the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry stumbled 13 years ago after Republicans in Congress pressed for a law that restricted communications satellite exports. The lawmakers praised it as a security precaution that would prevent China and other perceived foes from stealing technology secrets. Detractors saw it as a cynical ploy meant to discredit the Clinton administration and its policy of Chinese engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That law put communications satellites on Washington's list of export-controlled munitions: tools of war like tanks, bombs, missiles and equipment for making nuclear arms. Foreign companies took the opportunity to increase their satellite sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law gives Mr. Obama the authority to return communications satellites to their previous status as civilian technology. It retains provisions that restrict the export of satellites to nations like China and North Korea, and to sponsors of state terrorism like Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who introduced a bill to change the policy on satellite exports and whose state is a space industry hub, said the measure offered satellite manufacturers a crucial lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Companies across the country have been operating at a disadvantage due to these policies,'' he said in a statement. ''These reforms will give our businesses a chance to compete globally while still protecting our national security interests.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strict export controls arose from a political fight over satellite launchings by China, which in the 1980s began offering cheap rides into orbit on low-cost rockets. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, both Republicans, approved transfers of American spacecraft to Chinese rockets, as did President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in early 1998, a series of upsets brought the expanding trade to a halt. Two American satellite makers involved in the Chinese launchings, Hughes and Loral, were accused of giving China advice about making not only commercial rockets, but also military missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans, who controlled Congress at the time, argued that satellite exports could lead to a hemorrhage of secret materials and information, and said that China might already have stolen encryption secrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the strict export rules took effect in 1999, the legal complications involved in selling communications satellites and components abroad contributed to a sharp decline in the American share of the market, from a dominating position to about 50 percent today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama said the rules had ''unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry'' and vowed to push for change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, who for a decade helped lead the movement for change, said its culmination as law would help restore the nation's competitiveness in the global satellite market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Treating commercial satellites and components as if they were lethal weapons, regardless of whether they're going to friend or foe, has gravely harmed U.S. space manufacturers,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berman added that the benefits extended beyond the manufacturers. The national security establishment relies on the companies and their technological skills to fulfill the government's satellite needs and to develop spacecraft involved in a wide range of military missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they can't compete in the international marketplace,'' he said of the companies, ''they can't innovate and cannot survive.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 14, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> counted 52 million streams of the Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner's supersonic, record-breaking jump from a balloon 24 miles above the New Mexico desert. <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> called it ''one of the most-viewed live events ever,'' and it landed at No. 10 on the video-sharing site's year-end trending list -- the first time a science-related subject made the list, a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> spokeswoman said. (<span class="companylink">Google</span> listed the leap as No. 7 in its Zeitgeist 2012 of trending events.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felix Baumgartner's supersonic freefall from 128k' - Mission Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In surprising numbers, people posted, viewed and searched for science-related topics last year -- sharing news from space and undersea, commenting on new discoveries and uploading photos and video in a full-out embrace of the ability to communicate with thousands of others about global subjects in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> message on Aug. 5 from @MarsCuriosity, NASA's official rover handle -- ''Gale Crater I Am in You!!!'' -- was retweeted more than 72,000 times. Photos of the space shuttle Endeavour flying over the West Coast, on its way to its final resting place, ricocheted across the planet. And the director James Cameron's claim to have sent the ''deepest tweet'' -- from the Mariana Trench, about seven miles below the surface of the Pacific -- was rated one of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s ''moments of serendipity and just plain awesomeness'' (though it was actually sent by a friend above water). Four science-related events made that list, with the Mars landing at No. 1.In an age of despair over math and science acuity, it appears that what was once considered uninteresting or unfathomable has become cool and exciting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover Animation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People now feel that ''if they're not paying attention, they're missing out on something,'' said Kevin Allocca, the trends manager for <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover in particular has picked up followers and likes at amazing speed and volume, though it is the fourth landing of an American space exploration vehicle on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went from 120,000 on Aug. 4 to over 800,000 followers on landing night,'' Veronica McGregor, the media relations and social media manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said of its <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account. ''And then we hit a million really quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months after the landing, the mission was averaging about 30,000 <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> mentions a month. The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page for NASA's Mars rover Curiosity is heading toward a half-million likes, and the hashtag #Curiosity was the fifth most used on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Plus in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is, in some ways, self-fulfilling. Social media platforms are growing in popularity. There is also more online content, which is becoming more accessible, entertaining and engaging, Mr. Allocca said. Science subjects are also universal, more likely to attract global audiences. And people who are interested in science and technology tend to be especially comfortable with seeking and sharing information in digital ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, an epidemic of science geekiness seems to have broken out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Mr. Baumgartner's jump ranked higher than Mitt Romney's announcement of Representative Paul D. Ryanof Wisconsin as his running mate, according to the Talk Meter, a tool that compares chatter on the social site with baseline conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Zeitgeist 2012 list, ''Stratosphere jump'' follows ''Presidential debate'' (No. 6) but surpasses ''Penn State scandal'' (No. 8) and ''Trayvon Martin shooting'' (No. 9). ''Hurricane Sandy'' is No. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA (which now has about 1.6 million likes on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>) has also become more sophisticated and assertive about doling out information piece by piece to sustain interest. The strategy plays into the strengths of social platforms, which allow users to dip in and out of streams of news and information at their convenience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's ''Seven Minutes of Terror'' video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, about the difficulties of landing the rover, attracted two million views. And a satirical video made independently of NASA, ''We're NASA and We Know It'' -- to the tune of ''I'm Sexy and I Know It'' (chorus: ''Crane lower that rover'') -- has gotten close to 2.7 million views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges of Getting to Mars: Curiosity's Seven Minutes of Terror</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also more ways for followers to engage in events: helping to name the rover, or picking up a Curiosity Explorer badge on <span class="companylink">Foursquare</span> for checking in at a NASA visitor center, science museum or planetarium. Ms. McGregor said that NASA, in turn, was paying attention to what its fans want. It was learning that with so many followers just starting to connect with the whole space thing, the agency needs to provide more basic information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earthlings have long had a fascination with the unknown. But social media experts say people can now feel as if they are part of the adventure. They can watch events live, then incorporate the developments in their ''timelines.'' They can follow science -- and not have to worry about taking the final exam.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circumnavigation From Magellan to Orbit</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Joyce E. Chaplin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 535 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joyce E. Chaplin faces a challenge in ''Round About the Earth.'' She's written a 535-page history of circumnavigation, from the voyages of Ferdinand Magellan (1519-22) to the Dutch teenager Laura Dekker (2011-12), which is to say the history of a highly conceptual and antiquated exploit. We all sense that encircling the planet is -- or was -- quite a feat. But a feat of what, exactly? Today it's possible to book a round-the-world air ticket simply by tapping a smartphone. After Magellan's expedition did it the first time, one wonders if there's any sense in recording all those who came after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chaplin would argue that there is. And she does so with a storyteller's brevity and dry wit in this captivating account of world-rounding expeditions. Chaplin is a Harvard historian and the author of ''The First Scientific American: Benjamin Franklin and the Pursuit of Genius.'' She sees circumnavigation as an endeavor that began as conquest and evolved into an act of planetary love. World-circlers have given humanity a ''whole-body ­experience of the whole Earth,'' she writes, ''what it felt like, from agonizing to exhilarating.'' They brought us news of the world entire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's funny that Magellan stands as the supreme circumnavigator, given that he actually didn't circumnavigate. And that he was, as Chaplin points out, ''more or less a ruthless thug.'' His expedition began as a ploy to reach the Spice Islands -- now part of Indonesia's Malaku Islands -- via a radically backward route: sailing west, not east. The journey promised to make Magellan and his crew either very rich or very dead. The Spice Islands contained the world's only source of cloves, mace and nutmeg, and in the early 1500s sailors who survived the journey could sell them in Europe at an enormous profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magellan departed Spain with a flotilla of five ships carrying about 280 men and a huge store of supplies. To say he was neither well-liked nor trusted would be an understatement verging on fraud. Before he even reached the tip of South America, the masters of three ships conspired, unsuccessfully, to kill him. A fourth ditched the party and sailed home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's a lesson to be learned from Magellan's life, it's that bold doesn't pair well with stupid. While stopping in the Philippines, Magellan responded to a chieftain's insult with a rash show of force. He died in the ensuing battle, run through with bamboo spears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leadership fell to a Basque navigator named Juan Sebastián de Elcano. Though he received little credit -- no GPS units named for him, thank you very much -- Elcano was the one who actually completed the trip. Three years after departing, the expedition limped home with one ship, 18 survivors and a cargo of cloves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Death was a near certainty for the men who signed up for those early world-rounders. That didn't stop European regents from sending them, though. ''The most unfortunate legacy of the first circuit of the world,'' Chaplin writes, ''was a vision of world domination.'' From its very beginning, circumnavigation was an imperial act carried out by nations wanting or maintaining global empires. Chaplin observes that early circumnavigators ''had no respect for the territories of non-Europeans,'' and thought of foreign lands as resupply points or potential colonies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that vein, few circumnavigators surpassed the rudeness of the Englishman Francis Drake, who set out half a century after Elcano's return. Drake ­realized he could travel light and pick up provisions along the way. And by pick up I mean steal. ''The most precious resource, geographic knowledge, came in human form,'' Chaplin writes, ''and Drake stole that too.'' That is, Drake kidnapped pilots of plundered ships and put their coastline knowledge to work for him in the ­wheelhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one thing Drake couldn't steal was health. Those early voyages were death-ridden because of scurvy, the killing vitamin C deficiency brought about by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest challenge of circumnavigation over the centuries, in fact, hasn't been conveying the body around the globe as much as keeping it alive during the trip. The British navigator James Cook is often considered the Jonas Salk of scurvy, but it was actually an earlier English circumnavigator, John Byron, who pioneered the inclusion of fresh provisions into the shipboard diet. Cook came along a few years later and institutionalized Byron's innovations. By insisting upon a clean ship, dry clothes, ventilation and veggies and fruit, Cook safeguarded the lives of all but 6 of the 232 men on his 1772-75 circumnavigation. ''As one member of Cook's second voyage marveled,'' Chaplin writes, ''the mortality rate within the expedition was in fact statistically lower than could be found among men on land.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As ships improved, global travel became more an everyday fact than a daring feat. Wealthy tourists began taking the trip on their own dime. By the late 19th century circumnavigation had fallen into the tattered realm of the publicity stunt, carried out by odd characters backed by circulation-hungry newspapers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airplanes just made things worse. ''There would always be suspicion that flying around the world was cheating, that surface travel was more challenging,'' Chaplin notes. I'll bet you can't even name one of the four <span class="companylink">United States Army</span> Air Service pilots who first circumnavigated the Earth by air. Anybody? (Fredrick L. Martin, Lowell H. Smith, Leigh Wade, and Erik ''The Flying Viking'' Nelson. In 1924. It took them 175 days.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until the dawn of space travel that circumnavigation regained its luster. Here again, half the challenge was keeping the body alive during the trip. Special capsules and spacesuits had to be invented to protect astronauts from the killing vacuum of outer space. The low-gravity atrophy of muscle and bone became a kind of minor scurvy of space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the voyages of Elcano and Drake led monarchs to dream of world conquest, the 1961 orbit of the Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin showed that humanity had made at least a little progress. Instead of hatching plans to colonize the moon, world leaders came together some months after Gagarin's triumph to agree to a United Nations resolution declaring outer space and all celestial bodies to be ''free for exploration and use by all States.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the planet can be orbited in 90 minutes, speed records have been rendered meaningless. What matters in globe-trotting today isn't attainment but the manner in which the feat is done -- what mountaineers call ''good style.'' The most popular circumnavigators are actors. The ex-Python Michael Palin went 'round with curiosity and good humor in his BBC series ''Around the World in 80 Days.'' Palin's 1989 show was followed in 2004 by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's classic motorcycle journey, ''Long Way Round.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circumnavigation marks humanity's progress upon the Earth -- not just technological advancement, but the maturing of our relationship with the land, the sea and one another. Once we encircled it to own it; now we do so to comprehend it. Round-the-world travelers, Chaplin writes, ''generated copious evidence of humanity's longing for the Earth.'' Perhaps none expressed it more succinctly than Yuri Gagarin, who recalled looking down upon the entire planet for the very first time. ''It is,'' he said, ''indescribably beautiful.''</p>

Besides, the position is taken. Chris Lewicki, the president of Planetary Resources, a company based in this city just east of Seattle, has it on his business cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly an audacious thing that we're after,'' said Mr. Lewicki, 38.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of small start-up companies have stars in their eyes, captivated by entrepreneurial dreams -- some half-baked, some brilliant, often a bit of both -- of global success and riches. Here, at least the part about the stars is literal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an otherwise unremarkable low-rise office park, with the Bread of Life Christian Church and a gym as neighbors, Mr. Lewicki and about 30 employees are aiming beyond Earth for the next great gold rush. (They are actually after the platinum group of metals, which dwarf gold in value and rarity.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are planning, within a decade or so, an unmanned robotic mining mission to the asteroid belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is not new. Space exploration enthusiasts have talked about harvesting the ancient, mineral-laden chunks of rock that hurtle through interplanetary space since at least the 1920s. A decade ago, in the frothy go-go era before the recession, an asteroid mining company was started and sold shares to the public before crashing to earth and going out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is new is the money and backing from people with global reputations who have said they think Planetary Resources has the right stuff. The company, quietly founded in 2010 and rarely seeking any attention until recently, has the filmmaker James Cameron as an adviser. Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt, top executives at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, are among the investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, as millions of moviegoers know, resource extraction efforts ended in tears for the miners in Mr. Cameron's space epic ''Avatar.'' Those miners sought something called unobtanium, whatever that was, on a faraway moon. Mr. Cameron did not respond to e-mailed questions or repeated requests for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But company leaders at Planetary Resources said in an interview that their business model would be based on the journey itself. Creating a company that could one day launch ships into the unknown darkness of space, and, rather like the shipping magnates of sailing and whaling days past, wait years for a booty-laden return means selling space technology along the way -- much of which will have to be invented -- to help finance the dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is developing its own orbital telescope, for example, geared to survey remote asteroids to figure out what they are made of, with a planned launching within two years. But it also plans to produce the devices commercially, with a price in the single-digit millions, for corporations, governments or individuals. The idea, company officials said, is to finance finding and mining asteroids by selling, in a sense, the shovels and picks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The engineering in many cases has been solved,'' said Mr. Lewicki, who spent 10 years at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory before joining Planetary Resources. ''What will settle the winners from the laggards will be who can find the best economic model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economics of space, said Eric Anderson, a founder of the company, also look increasingly different as the costs and complications of resource extraction here on Earth have soared. Getting deep-sea oil off the coast of Brazil, for example, is expected to cost billions before the first barrel is pumped, he said, which makes the ''single-digit billions,'' which Mr. Anderson estimates his company will ultimately need to launch a prospecting ship and return within the next decade, a much less daunting number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are on the scale of the kind of resource dollars that get spent on Earth to bring something on line,'' he said. ''The private equity markets are used to that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here are very excited about water, too. Recently published discoveries that water is more prevalent in the nearby universe than previously believed have become part of the plan here, because water can be distilled to hydrogen, allowing -- at least in theory -- an asteroid ship to travel light, making its own fuel on site for the return trip. Water has been found even on Mercury, locked in ice on the poles of the hottest planet in the solar system, nearest the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a really interesting mixture of the highly technical and highly primitive,'' said Mark V. Sykes, the chief executive and director of the Planetary Science Institute, a 40-year-old private nonprofit research organization based in Tucson. Dr. Sykes described how a spacecraft might dock on an asteroid with sophisticated technology and then use simple concentrated sunlight to make fuel for the long slow voyage home, perhaps by solar sail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while some scientists like Dr. Sykes, who has advised Planetary Resources on asteroid science, said they thought the company could indeed one day go where no mining company has gone before, skeptics said they thought the timeline for making a trip out and back, with something to sell at the end, could be far longer and more expensive than company officials thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They look like rocks, like you could reach out and break off a piece, but they are almost certainly rubble piles,'' said Erik Asphaug, a professor of planetary science at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span> who studies asteroids. With unstable, unconsolidated interiors and no gravity to speak of in most nearby asteroids, many of which are about the size of a city block, a ship would not be able to land at all in a traditional sense, but instead would have to dock as though with a space station and then lock itself onto the asteroid to keep from bouncing back into space. The details are devilish and could take decades, in his opinion, if not a century, to solve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the question of saving us from the Big One.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively little money is being spent now on developing tools that could avert or destroy a large asteroid discovered to be on a collision course with Earth, Professor Asphaug said. But if one day a threat were to emerge, he added, the company or companies that know most about asteroids could suddenly be quite popular with the world's governments -- not for riches, but rescue.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Korean satellite launched into space last week appears to be tumbling in orbit and is most likely dead, astronomers are reporting. The evident failure will not cause the spacecraft to fall quickly back to earth but seems to represent a major blow to the North's portrayal of the launching as a complete triumph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's spinning or tumbling, and we haven't picked up any transmissions,'' said Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks rocket launchings and space activity. ''Those two things are most consistent with the satellite being entirely inactive at this point.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea's state-run news media said nothing about the satellite's dysfunction, focusing instead on the event the launching was supposed to honor: the somber first anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-il, the longtime leader. As part of the coverage, state television broadcast video of his daughter-in-law -- her first public appearance in more than a month -- that appeared to confirm that a new member of North Korea's notoriously reclusive Kim dynasty is on its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images showed Ri Sol-ju, the wife of Kim Jong-il's son and successor, Kim Jong-un, dressed in a dark flowing dress and walking slowly beside her husband inside the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum in Pyongyang, the capital, where Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il-sung, lie in state. Although she was wearing a high-waisted, loose-fit, traditional ''hanbok'' dress, and there was no official mention of pregnancy, South Korean media detected what they considered a visibly swollen belly. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted a government source as saying that birth was ''imminent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State media has been describing the satellite launching as a triumphal achievement of the young leader, completed despite worldwide criticism and United Nations sanctions on the North's ballistic missile program. On the day of the launching, the mission director, Kim Hye-jin, told reporters that the satellite was broadcasting in orbit ''Song of Gen. Kim Il-sung'' and ''Song of Gen. Kim Jong-il.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, about the size of a washing machine, reportedly carries an on-board camera to observe the earth. That mission requires the spacecraft to remain quite steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McDowell said tumbling would imply that on-board systems meant to control and stabilize the craft had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that radio astronomers had picked up no signals from the satellite and that optical astronomers had observed it brightening and dimming as it slowly rotated through space end over end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clear that the rocket part of this mission worked very well for the North Koreans,'' Dr. McDowell said in an interview. ''They ended up in the right orbit. But the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the satellite failed either during the ascent or shortly afterwards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea fired the small satellite into orbit last Wednesday atop a long-range rocket, a first for the impoverished nation. The official Korean Central News Agency hailed it as demonstrating ''indomitable spirit and massive national capabilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, rumors circulated in Washington that the satellite was malfunctioning. Astronomers who turned a variety of telescopes on the sky have now gathered evidence that supports that finding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Roberts, a retired professional astronomer who lives in Cape Town, South Africa, reported Sunday on an Internet site that he was able to observe the satellite flashing through repeated cycles that would brighten and dim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, he added, ''appears to be doing a regular tumble.'' On Monday, he added that new observations showed the satellite reaching its maximum brightness roughly once every 16 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail, Mr. Roberts cautioned that he still needed to make more observations to confirm the evident tumbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glaring absence of any signals or other signs of life from the spacecraft suggests it is dormant or dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radio silence stands in contrast to North Korea's early wave of excited proclamations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Christy, a British radio astronomer who has tracked satellites for decades and runs an observers' Internet site, said in an e-mail from England that for days after the launching he listened for the satellite but could hear nothing and found no plausible signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I still wouldn't rule out it turning up,'' Mr. Christy said. But he noted that North Korean officials have already missed an opportunity to make ''any real propaganda out of it transmitting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted Molczan, a sky watcher in Toronto who is also tracking the satellite, said tumbling would have little if any impact on the orbit's decay and the satellite's re-entry through the atmosphere, where the blistering heat of friction will eventually cause it to burn up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be up there for at least a few years,'' Mr. Molczan said. ''The real question is whether the satellite is functioning. Right now, it looks like it's rotating aimlessly.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ebb and Flow are no more. The two spacecraft of NASA's Grail mission crashed on the Moon at about 5:28 p.m. Eastern time, about 30 seconds apart, one of the few times that cheers and claps have been heard in the control room to celebrate the loss of a spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced it had named the impact sites after Sally Ride, the first American woman in space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crashes into a lunar mountain brought the yearlong mission to map the Moon's gravity field to an end. The twin spacecraft were running low on maneuvering fuel, and NASA wanted to make sure that they did not accidentally destroy a historical site like one of the Apollo landings -- ­ unlikely, but possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA broadcast live commentary of the impacts on its Web site, but provided no live video showing the probes hitting the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my article last week about the impending demise of Ebb and Flow, I noted, ''Unfortunately, since the action will happen on the dark side of the Moon, there will be nothing for earthlings to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a gazillion people, including Robert Kirshner, a Harvard astronomy professor, wrote in to ask, ''Didn't you mean to write 'far side' and not 'dark side'?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more annoyed wrote: ''Dark Side of the Moon??? Come on now. You know that is not correct! You completely blew a potential teaching moment, to educate the public that the **FAR** side of the Moon is **NOT** dark! Instead you perpetuated yet another scientific misconception. No wonder we are facing a crisis in science literacy in the U.S. The New York Times can and should do better!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except I really meant, ''dark side'' ­ -- the side of the Moon facing away from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was confusing to many was a remembered tidbit about the Moon, that there is always one face towards Earth, and the other always out of view, and they presumed that the crashes will be on the far side and therefore blocked from view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that were the case, ''far side'' would be correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the news conference last week, Maria T. Zuber, the principal investigator, said the probes would be crashing into a ''non-sunlit'' part of the surface. I translated that into a more common word: dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, it was a nice allusion to Pink Floyd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because there is a permanent near side and a permanent far side, many interpreted ''dark side'' as ''permanently dark side.'' As the readers pointed out, as the Moon rotates, the Sun rises over the entire surface during the course of a monthlong lunar day. That's true. The crash sites, which are actually on the near side of the Moon, are not always dark, but what is relevant is that the crash sites were dark at 5:28 p.m on Monday. The crashes were not visible because the area was dark, not because they were out of the line of sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a couple of weeks, it will come back into sunlight, and it's at that point that NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will attempt to photograph the gouges left by the two Grail spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is easy to see if you sketch out three circles, for the Sun, Earth and Moon. Then it's instantly clear that the dark side -- the side facing away from the Sun --­ is different from the far side, ­ the side facing away from the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or just remember: Pink Floyd has nothing to do with Gary Larson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, astronomers should come up with a term to describe the side of the Moon facing away from the sun. (Make your suggestions in the comments.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A smaller number of readers wondered why the spacecraft will crash when the maneuvering fuel runs out. The Moon has no atmosphere and therefore there is no friction to slow them down. But the Moon's gravity is uneven and the orbit is not perfectly circular. Without periodic course adjustments, it will become more chaotic and elliptical, and the ellipse will intersect with the surface of the Moon -- i.e., crash.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ebb and Flow, two space probes the size of washing machines that have been orbiting the Moon and measuring its gravity field, will perform an orchestrated death plunge on Monday, crashing into the body's dark side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exercise will not be for the advance of science, but rather something of a garbage-disposal operation, to make sure that the probes -- which are running out of fuel -- do not come to rest in a historically significant place, like on Neil Armstrong's footprints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon has been affronted this way many times before, especially during the space race of the 1960s, but NASA is now trying to dispose of its litter more carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the first impact will come 40 seconds past 5:38 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Dec. 17 when Ebb slams into a mountain near the Moon's north pole at 3,760 miles per hour. The second, from Ebb's twin, Flow, will come 20 seconds later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, since the action will happen on the dark side of the Moon, there will be nothing for earthlings to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not expecting a flash that is visible from Earth,'' Maria T. Zuber, the mission's primary investigator, said Thursday during a telephone news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is all by design as NASA wraps up its Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission, or Grail, for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To map the gravity, the two spacecraft are in an orbit passing over the Moon's north and south poles. They pass over all parts of the lunar surface as the Moon rotates below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the probes' fuel ran out and their orbits decayed, they could crash anywhere on the Moon, including a slim chance -- eight in one million -- that one of them could obliterate those famous footprints or another historic site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the spacecraft guided into a mountain, the chances are zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in their demise, however, Ebb and Flow may be able to aid the cause of science. Another of NASA's spacecraft, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, will pass over the crash sites, and scientists hope that they will be able to tell something about the mountain -- which is a remnant of a crater rim -- from the gouges created by Ebb and Flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what the crash might look like to someone standing there, David Lehman, the project manager for Grail, said, ''It'll be like a washing machine landing on top of you, and it'll be a very bad day for you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in September 2011, the two spacecraft slipped into lunar orbit at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the primary mission, the two spacecraft orbited at an altitude of 34 miles. Wobbles in the distance between them told of variations in the Moon's gravitational field. For example, the gravity would be stronger when the spacecraft passed over a mountain field or a clump of dense minerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Ebb and Flow, scientists now have more precise measurements of the Moon's gravity than of the Earth or any other planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the primary mission was completed, the two spacecraft were nudged to a lower altitude of 14 miles -- for more precise measurements -- and then, on Dec. 6, even lower to 6.6 miles. But maintaining that low altitude depleted the maneuvering fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the Grail mission already has shown that the Moon's crust is thinner than had been thought, and that it was pulverized by impacts during the early history of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon's density, deduced from the gravity, places constraints on what it could be made of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Dr. Zuber said, the Moon appears to contain the same abundance of aluminum as the Earth, supporting the theory that the Moon was formed out of a cataclysmic collision of a Mars-size body and the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data so far does not support a hypothesis that the Earth once had two Moons that later collided and combined into one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravity data could also help future travelers, human and robotic, navigate to a precise location on the Moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This actually decreases the costs of future exploration of the Moon,'' Dr. Zuber said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 15, 2012, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about NASA's plan to crash two space probes into the moon misstated part of the formal name of a NASA mission.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kim sent a personally signed approval for North Korean scientists to launch the rocket on Wednesday, and later visited a control center outside Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to oversee the procedure, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's dispatch was monitored by the South Korean news agency <span class="companylink">Yonhap</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North's Unha-3 rocket blasted off from a launching site in northwestern North Korea on Wednesday and put a satellite into orbit. The success provided a propaganda boon for Mr. Kim in his efforts to build his image as a young yet competent leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching ''cemented our position as a space technology powerhouse by indisputably demonstrating that our nation has climbed the pinnacle of world-class advanced technology,'' Mr. Kim was quoted as saying, adding that the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite was ''built with our technology and wisdom alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North's ''peaceful space program'' resulted from its policy of ''developing scientific technology and the economy,'' Mr. Kim said. ''We must continue to launch satellites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">South Korean Defense Ministry</span> said Thursday that the satellite was orbiting at a speed of 4.7 miles per second, though it was not known whether it was functioning normally. Its mission is unclear, though North Korean space officials have said the satellite will be used to study crops and weather patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Security Council called the launching a violation of <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> resolutions that ban the country from ''any launch using ballistic missile technology,'' and said it would consider an ''appropriate response.'' Washington and its allies say the real purpose of the North Korean rocket program has less to do with putting satellites into orbit than with mastering the technology needed to deliver a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By stressing Mr. Kim's personal involvement in the rocket program, the North Korean media was apparently trying to bolster Mr. Kim's leadership. North Korea, hardly able to feed its people without outside aid, considers its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs the pride of its ''military first'' policy, and has been crediting Mr. Kim as a key supporter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While supervising the 2009 launching of a long-range rocket, Mr. Kim ''determined to enter a war if the enemies dared to intercept'' the rocket, official media reported at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Thursday, South Korean officials said they were closely monitoring the North's main nuclear test site in northeastern North Korea for signs of a third test. The country conducted an underground nuclear test in 2006 and again in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said the timing of another test was a political rather than a technical decision. In recent months, international experts analyzing satellite imagery of the site have reported tunneling activities there. But they reported no indications of an imminent underground test.</p>

His previous books -- both from Abrams -- include ''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes'' (2003) and ''Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle'' (2009).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His goal in ''Planetfall,'' he writes, is to present ''a retrospective look at the visual legacy of 21st-century space exploration.'' Mr. Benson reminds us that it has been just 50 years since the first spacecraft waltzed with another planet, when an American Mariner probe dipped past Venus in December 1962. He then takes us on an interplanetary pleasure cruise that stretches from the Sun to Saturn. All retrospectives, art and otherwise, should shock us awake the way this one does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense, Mr. Benson has scrapbooked an up-to-date album of our solar system using mostly primary-image data from NASA and European Space Agency missions from 2000 to 2012. And so, among dozens of striking images, we're privileged to see Earthrise on the Moon and the restless sand seas of Mars; sunspots in bloom and the cryptic moons of Jupiter; and the rings of Saturn looking like the cosmic grooves of a very long-playing album.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson's first definition of the word planetfall is ''the act or instance of sighting a planet after a space voyage.'' And one of the delights here is that the reader makes planetfall too, joining the community of camera-bearing, spacefaring robots and their human handlers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dynamics of observing are complex. In these photos we're not just gazing at lunar barrens and the dunes and lakes of Titan, a moon of Saturn, but also, in a sense, looking at ourselves, turning the solar system into a mirror of human achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subtext of these images is our guts and intelligence as a species able to secure such photographs, in willing ourselves into outer space. We weren't invited to the vast celestial prom, but we went anyway. From ancient times, the cosmos have colonized our inner space, but now we can abandon land rovers on Mars, blithely building our very own Martian junkyards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting at that tension, Mr. Benson quotes the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg to good effect: ''We have to remember that what we see is not nature herself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a book full of startling photographs -- I gasped at the images of the Sun, the heat rising off the page making me feel as if something inside me were melting -- the one that stunned me the most was taken in November 2006 by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter of frosted southern dunes on Mars in winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a three-page gatefold spread those dunes are as lush as an Edward Weston bodyscape and make me want to shout Cézanne, Picasso, Tanguy all at once. But this abstract and alien Mars-scape is real, not a bug-eyed monster in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Planetfall'' is a book of science through and through, but it also deepens our sense of the miracle and the mystery of the universe, of our eye-blink lives. We're all bundled in bewilderment on this little blue bungalow between Mars and Venus, but Mr. Benson has given us a cozy front porch, a fine place from which to watch Ms. Smith's high beams of a million galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A show based on ''Planetfall'' will be on view Jan. 24 to March 9 at the Hasted Kraeutler Gallery, 537 West 24th Street, in Manhattan.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- While many obsessed over speculation that NASA's newest Mars rover, Curiosity, had dug up signs of life -- it had not -- it is the agency's older, smaller jalopy, Opportunity, that has been exploring a more intriguing plot of Martian real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is our first glimpse ever at conditions on ancient Mars that clearly show us a chemistry that would have been suitable for life,'' Steven W. Squyres, the principal investigator for Opportunity, said at a news conference last week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity could be sitting on rocks chock-full of organic molecules -- but the rover and the scientists back on Earth would never know. Unlike Curiosity, Opportunity is not carrying instruments that can detect those kinds of molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the scientists are not complaining. Everything from Opportunity over the past eight years has been a bonus for a mission that was to have ended long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, for what was supposed to be a three-month mission. Yet the rover continues operating in good condition. (Its twin, Spirit, died in 2010, stuck in a sand trap and unable to point its solar arrays in the correct direction to survive winter, outliving its planned lifetime by almost six years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Opportunity arrived at a 14-mile-wide crater named Endeavour, where NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted clays from above. Clays generally form in the presence of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clay signal pointed to a hill, which the scientists named after Jacob Matijevic, an engineer on the rover team who died this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Opportunity approached, ''We started seeing things that looked really, really different,'' Dr. Squyres said. The most common rock there was light-colored, fine-grained, very soft, and nothing like any that Opportunity had come across before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is right in the sweet spot of where the clay signature is present,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''It has got to be the clay-bearing stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the rover looked at the elements in the rock, it was the same mix of elements in a typical Martian rock. ''What's unusual is that it's not unusual,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''This puzzled us at first. I was expecting something dramatic and instead what you see here kind of looks like average Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another instrument could have identified minerals in the rock, but the radioactive cobalt it relies on has long decayed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity were at the Endeavour crater, its instruments could directly look for the carbon-based molecules known as organics that are the building blocks of life. But Curiosity, which landed in August, is more than 5,000 miles away exploring a different crater where clays have also been spotted from orbit -- and it is still months away from reaching there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its nearly nine years on Mars, Opportunity has driven more than 22 miles, crossing a Martian plain and stopping by several smaller craters. During its travels, it came across minerals that pointed to flowing water in Mars' past, but these minerals formed in highly acidic conditions. ''Battery acid kind of numbers,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''And that's a challenging place for life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clays only form in more benign conditions. ''The thing that's different here is that these clay minerals point towards a neutral chemistry -- water you can drink,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''And that's a different story, a different world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These rocks appear to date to the early warm and wet era of Mars, perhaps when the planet was more hospitable to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Opportunity took a look at another outcrop on Matijevic Hill made of darker, harder minerals. Close up, it saw tiny spheres embedded in the rocks, similar in appearance to iron-rich spheres nicknamed ''blueberries'' that the rover had observed earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except these did not contain much iron. ''These are something totally different,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''I've been calling them newberries, because there's something new.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though Opportunity cannot find organics, Dr. Squyres said there were many questions that it would be able to answer that would tell scientists what this part of early Mars was like. What are the newberries made of? How did they form? Did wind or water shape the rocks of Matijevic Hill?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity will spend several months at Matijevic Hill to try to unravel as many of these puzzles as it can, using its remaining instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have stumbled upon here at Matijevic Hill, drawn here by that clay signature, is what's turning out to be one of the most delightful geologic puzzles that we have ever found with this rover on Mars,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''It's fascinating. It's a work in progress.''</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 217th consecutive year, useful facts and tips like these have been assembled in J. Gruber's Hagerstown Town and Country Almanack, a deceptively slim volume that is available to farmers, merchants and all good citizens -- especially those residing in the Middle Atlantic States -- at the nominal cost of $4.99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contained within its 82 pages is the accumulated wisdom of many generations of farmers who lived and worked according to the arc of the sun and the pull of the moon. This means that in addition to reporting that our nation's fifth vice president was Elbridge Gerry and that the gift of a daffodil represents unrequited love, Gruber's Almanack also provides ''conjecture of the weather and other astronomical information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, if you want to know what weather to expect in New England next Thanksgiving Day, the almanac offers an answer with a better-than-even shot at accuracy: ''Snow, heavy south.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the educated guess of Bill O'Toole, 70, a retired college math professor who, for more than four decades, has served as the almanac's seventh prognosticator -- or conjecturer, or calculator -- a line of work that began in 1797 with a star-savvy blacksmith. Mr. O'Toole is tall and bearded, with large eyes that convey wonder in all things, and a business card that declares in black and white his gray-area profession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from desk space carved out of the book clutter of a brick row house here in Emmitsburg, about a mile south of the Pennsylvania line, Mr. O'Toole endeavors to divine the weather as much as 18 months in advance. He does so with a conjurer's brew of age-old wisdom and 21st-century technology that includes a range of tools, from a software program of astronomical data produced by the <span class="companylink">United States Naval Observatory</span> to the meticulous tracking -- through some 30 computer programs he has written -- of all things lunar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon matters, Mr. O'Toole says, as people who work the land discovered long ago. ''They noticed a trend,'' he says. ''When the moon changed phase close to midnight, the weather over the next lunar week, between six and nine days, would be fair, agreeable, calm. But it was just the opposite if it occurred close to noon: snowy, rainy, stormy, disagreeable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After completing his calculations, Mr. O'Toole charts his predictions on postcard-size weather maps of the continental United States, drawing a map for every week. Here, then, a test: Did the prognosticator foretell Sandy, the fall's calamitous superstorm?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He points to a blue-ink swirl that he drew on one of those small maps. In June 2011. ''Tropical storm from Atlantic,'' the Almanack predicted -- somewhat prematurely, it turned out. ''I was off by a week and a few days,'' he says. ''Not too bad, considering this was done 16 months earlier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Toole ignores the occasional charge of quackery. He says that a person could predict the weather 25 percent of the time by simply throwing darts at a board, but that he shoots for better than 50 percent. And, in the annual ''Conjecturer's Column'' that he writes for the almanac, he is nothing if not candid about his performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Daily forecasts for the mid-Atlantic region were correct 55.1 percent of the time, slightly below last year's 59.3 percent, which was the best in recent years,'' Mr. O'Toole wrote in the current almanac. ''The worst month for daily forecasts was October at 38.7 percent; the best was May, clocking in at 72.6 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Toole grew up in nearby Waynesboro, Pa. His father, William, was a toolmaker and sales representative, his mother, Dora, a homemaker and parish secretary who had grown up on a dairy farm. After she died at 91 last year, Mr. O'Toole found a diary in which his mother had faithfully recorded the weather every day for nearly 70 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High 76 degrees; rain; bright moonlit night...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A deeply ingrained tradition among farmers,'' he explained. A small way of trying to make sense of the natural world by those so grounded in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Toole was a boy so drawn to the moon and the stars that in high school he helped to establish an amateur astronomy club. After flirting with the idea of a career in astronomy, he graduated from Mount St. Mary's University here, and promptly joined its math department as a teacher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then one day in 1969, he says, he received a call from ''out of the blue'' (a hoary expression that refers to the sky). It was the business manager of Gruber's Almanack, and he wanted to know: Are you familiar with our publication?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally published in German, then German and English, then only in English when German became a dead-to-me language during World War I, the Gruber Almanack was as much a part of the local universe as Jupiter and Saturn. You'd punch a hole in the top left corner, hang it on a string, and consult it for -- well, as the almanac puts it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rising, setting, and Eclipses of the Sun and Moon; the phases, places, and southing of the Moon; the aspects of the planets; the rising, setting, and southing of the most conspicuous planets and fixed stars; the equation of time; with a variety of useful and entertaining matter, anecdotes, &amp;c., &amp;c.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business manager went on to explain that the almanac's sixth prognosticator had passed away, and it was in need of its seventh. Was Mr. O'Toole interested?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He inherited his predecessor's charts and notes and, before long, was using the lunar cycle and other variables to recommend the best days to plant, to weed, to harvest -- even to go fishing (May 30 next year is good, for example, but May 31 is better).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The almanac has been passed on through the generations within the same family. These days it is owned and produced by three men driven more by loyalty than by money: Mr. O'Toole, a retired professor, is the prognosticator; Jerry Spessard, 63, a retired insurance agent and part-time inventor, is the longtime business manager; and Charles W. Fisher Jr., 63, a retired sales executive, is the editor and great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Johann Gruber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, circulation has waxed and waned -- it now is about 85,000 -- but the readership remains fully engaged. Mr. Spessard often receives calls about sweet recollections of a grandmother's reliance on the almanac, as well as angry complaints about a typographical error that might disrupt the spin of the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the earth continues to spin, and J. Gruber's Hagerstown Town and Country Almanack continues to advise and to console. Dental floss can also be used as an emergency shoelace. The state flower of Maryland is the black-eyed Susan. And if you plan to be in the mid-Atlantic next Memorial Day, the prognosticator suggests that you might want to pack an umbrella.</p>

At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, scientists said the mineralogical composition was similar to what was found by the earlier Spirit and Opportunity rovers elsewhere on Mars. An instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars, or Sam for short, looked at the gases that escaped as it heated the dirt to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The most common gases were water vapor and carbon dioxide. The Sam instrument also detected chlorinated methane -- a small, simple compound that falls in the category of organics, which are the building blocks of life. But the scientists said it was too early to say that the soil itself contained organics. The carbon could be vestiges of molecules that the spacecraft brought from Earth, and the organics could have been generated by chemical reactions as the dirt was heated.</p>

The spacecraft, which is more than 11 billion miles from Earth, has entered a ''magnetic highway,'' a new region of crisscrossing charged particles, some from the Sun and some from interstellar space. But researchers, speaking at a news briefing in Pasadena, Calif., said there was no indication of a change in the magnetic field that would indicate that Voyager had entered interstellar space itself. Edward Stone, a Voyager project scientist, said this new region may be the last layer before interstellar space, but it could take the spacecraft another two or three years to cross it. Voyager 1 is traveling about 11 miles a second; a companion craft, Voyager 2, is not quite as far from the Sun and is traveling slower, less than 10 miles a second.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, possesses a lot of ice -- 100 billion to one trillion tons -- scientists working with NASA's Messenger spacecraft reported on Thursday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator for Messenger, said there was enough ice there to encase Washington, D.C., in a frozen block two and a half miles deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a counterintuitive discovery for a place that also ranks among the hottest in the solar system. At noon at the equator on Mercury, the temperature can hit 800 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But near Mercury's poles, deep within craters where the Sun never shines, temperatures dip to as cold as minus 370.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In these planetary bodies, there are hidden places, as it were, that can have interesting things going on,'' said David J. Lawrence, a senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory working on the Messenger mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings appear in a set of three papers published Thursday on the Web site of the journal Science. The ice could be an intriguing science target for a future robotic lander or even a resource for astronauts in the far future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists had strong hints of the ice a couple of decades ago when telescopes bounced radio waves off Mercury and the reflections were surprisingly bright. But some researchers suggested the craters could be lined with silicate compounds or sulfur, which might also be highly reflective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Messenger spacecraft, which swung into orbit around Mercury in March 2011 and has completed its primary mission, took a closer look by counting particles known as neutrons that are flying off the planet. High-energy cosmic rays break apart atoms, and the debris includes neutrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when a speeding neutron hits a hydrogen atom, which is almost the same weight, it comes to almost a complete stop, just as the cue ball in billiards transfers its momentum when it hits another ball. Water molecules contain two hydrogen atoms, and thus when Messenger passed over ice-rich areas, the number of neutrons dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same technique was used to detect frozen water below the surface on Mars and within similar craters on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neutron number would not have dropped if the bright surfaces had been made of sulfur or silicates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Water ice is the only candidate we've got that fits all those observations,'' said Dr. Solomon, who is also director of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ice is almost pure water, which indicates that it arrived within the last few tens of millions of years, possibly from a comet that smacked into Mercury. Dr. Solomon said several young craters on the surface of Mercury could be candidates for such an impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the icy regions were bright. In slightly warmer regions, where temperatures exceed minus 280, the ice was covered by a dark layer about half a foot thick. The scientists believe in these places the water ice vaporized, leaving behind other materials that had been trapped, including carbon-based molecules known as organics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be similar to how water and the building blocks of life reached Earth billions of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water could also be an intriguing resource for people. Between the scorched equator and the frozen poles, temperatures on Mercury can be temperate, especially a few feet below the surface, where the soil insulates against the temperature swings between day and night -- an ideal location to build a colony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People joke about it, but it's not so crazy, really,'' said David A. Paige, a professor of geology at U.C.L.A. who calculated the crater temperatures.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars rover Curiosity has found something -- something noteworthy, in a pinch of Martian sand. But what is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists working on the mission who know are not saying. Outside of that team, lots of people are guessing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intrigue started last week when John P. Grotzinger, the Mars mission's project scientist, told <span class="companylink">National Public Radio</span>: ''This data is going to be one for the history books. It's looking really good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he declined to say anything more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fossils? Living microbial Martians? Maybe the carbon-based molecules known as organics, which are the building blocks of life? That so much excitement could be set off by a passing hint reflects the enduring fascination of both scientists and nonscientists with Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could be all kinds of things,'' said Peter H. Smith, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who was the principal investigator for NASA's earlier Phoenix Mars mission but is not involved with Curiosity. ''If it's historic, I think it's organics. That would be historic in my book.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger and other Curiosity scientists will announce their latest findings on Monday in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do not expect pictures of Martians, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Webster, a spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which operates Curiosity, said the findings would be ''interesting'' rather than ''earthshaking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webster noted that ''a really big announcement,'' if one should occur, would most likely be made at NASA headquarters in Washington and not at an academic conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever is revealed will be linked to the work of Curiosity's sophisticated chemistry laboratory instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars -- SAM, for short. The rover's robotic arm dropped the first bit of sand and dust into the instrument on Nov. 9, and the scientists have been analyzing and contemplating ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main goals of SAM is to identify organic molecules, but it would be a big surprise for organics to show up in a first look at a sand sample selected more as a test exercise than with the expectation of a breakthrough discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity will be headed toward layers of clays, which could be rich in organics and are believed to have formed during a warm and wet era early in the planet's history. But Curiosity has months to drive before arriving at those locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Curiosity scientists have learned through experience that it pays to double-check their results before trumpeting them. An initial test of the Martian atmosphere by the same instrument showed the presence of methane, which would have been a major discovery, possibly indicating the presence of methane-generating microbes living on Mars today. But when the scientists ran the experiment again, the signs of methane disappeared, leading them to conclude that the methane found in the first test had come from air that the spacecraft had carried to Mars from its launching spot in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webster, who was present during the interview with <span class="companylink">NPR</span>, said Dr. Grotzinger had been talking more generally about the quality of data coming back from Curiosity and was not suggesting that the data contained a breakthrough surprise. ''I don't think he had in mind, 'Here's some particular chemical that's been found,' '' Mr. Webster said. ''That's not my impression of the conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, Curiosity chimed in: ''What did I discover on Mars? That rumors spread fast online. My team considers this whole mission 'one for the history books.' '' (The public information staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory writes the posts for the rover.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would not be the first time that rumors eclipsed the actual findings from Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, the Mars Odyssey orbiter found evidence of frozen reservoirs of water beneath the surface of Mars, leading to breathless rumors in the British press that the Bush administration was about to announce a commitment to send astronauts there within 20 years. The White House remained quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Smith, the Phoenix Mars scientist, had a similar experience in 2008 when Aviation Week reported, ''The White House has been alerted by NASA about plans to make an announcement soon on major new Phoenix lander discoveries concerning the 'potential for life' on Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The blogosphere lit up,'' Dr. Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a hastily arranged news conference, Dr. Smith revealed the actual news: chemicals known as perchlorates had been found in the soil. ''The public was not interested in that,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity's pinch of sand indeed contained organics, it would again revive the possibilities of life on Mars. For now, Curiosity scientists are still analyzing the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do want to temper expectations,'' said Mr. Webster, the spokesman. ''But then again, I don't know exactly what they're going to say they've found.''</p>

Twenty thousand years ago, what is now New York City was at the edge of a giant ice sheet, and the sea was roughly 400 feet lower. But as the last ice age thawed, the sea rose to where it is today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we are in a new warming phase, and the oceans are rising again after thousands of years of stability.

In a world with oceans that are five feet higher, our calculations show that New York City would average one flood as high as Hurricane Sandy's about every 15 years, even without accounting for the stronger storms and bigger surges that are likely to result from warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Floods reaching five feet above the current high tide line will become increasingly common along the nation's coastlines well before the seas climb by five feet. Over the last century, the nearly eight-inch rise of the world's seas has already doubled the chance of ''once in a century'' floods for many seaside communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We hope that with enough time, most of our great coastal cities and regions will be able to prepare for a five-foot increase. Some will not. Barriers that might work in Manhattan would be futile in South Florida, where water would pass underneath them by pushing through porous bedrock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dr. Schaeffer's study, immediate and extreme pollution cuts -- measures well beyond any discussion now under way -- could limit sea level rise to five feet over 300 years. If we stay on our current path, the oceans could rise five feet by the first half of next century, then continue rising even faster. If instead we make moderate shifts in energy and industry -- using the kinds of targets that nations have contemplated in international talks but have failed to pursue -- sea level could still climb past 12 feet just after 2300. It is hard to imagine what measures might allow many of our great coastal cities to survive a 12-foot increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WE might find comfort in the fact that this is just one set of projections, and projections are notoriously tough to get right. But a second study that also came out this past summer erases any such comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by the geochemist Andrea Dutton and published in the journal Science, the second paper uses deep history, not model projections, for clues to the future. About 125,000 years ago, before the last ice age, there was a warm period that lasted 10,000 to 15,000 years. It was perhaps a little warmer than today, but cooler than the temperatures that climate scientists expect later in this century without sharp pollution cuts. Dr. Dutton's research strongly reinforces a prior study led by one of us, which found that the warm-period sea levels rose roughly 20 to 30 feet higher than those of today. We just don't have a clear picture of how fast that could happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any sea level forecast must be interpreted carefully: things could be better, or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schaeffer study uses the relationship between global temperature and sea level over the past 1,000 years -- when it was cool, and the great ice sheets were generally stable -- to extrapolate over the next 300 years -- when it will be hot, and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may behave differently. Other scientific teams have tried the notoriously difficult task of forecasting ice sheet decay in physical detail, and this has tended to produce slower estimates of sea level rise than the Schaeffer team's method. But any projection is compromised by the fact that we are sending heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere far faster than anything the planet has seen for at least 55 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dutton study comes with caveats, too. Earth's orbit was different during the last warm period, bringing more sunshine to the Arctic and complicating the analogy with today. But today we are on a path to a planet that will be much hotter than it was in the period Dr. Dutton studied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two basic ways to protect ourselves from sea level rise: reduce it by cutting pollution, or prepare for it by defense and retreat. To do the job, we must do both. We have lost our chance for complete prevention; and preparation alone, without slowing emissions, would -- sooner or later -- turn our coastal cities into so many Atlantises.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- Forty years after humans last walked on the Moon, Europe's space industry is hoping to play a key role in the resumption of manned lunar exploration planned for later this decade. But whether cash-strapped governments are prepared to pay for out-of-this-world projects remains unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science ministers from the 20 member states of the European Space Agency gather Tuesday in Naples for a two-day meeting where they will be asked to approve a budget of up to €12 billion, or $15.3 billion, for the next three years that would include financing for dozens of programs, including a new lunar crew transport vehicle, at least two Mars exploration missions and a successor to Europe's highly successful Ariane 5 rocket.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the U.S. space agency, NASA, had a budget of $18 billion for the 2012 fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not living on a different planet,'' Jean-Jacques Dordain, the E.S.A.'s director general, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters here. ''I know the difficulties of people. I read the newspapers. The economic situation will have an impact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the global economic crisis struck four years ago, the E.S.A. had been able to count on steady increases to its annual budget, which today stands at just over €4 billion. But industry executives predict that the fiscal and deficit pact forged this year to save the euro will most likely require several member states to reduce their financing of space programs. Mr. Dordain said he hoped the ministers in Naples would approve a budget of at least €10 billion through 2015 -- an average of €3.3 billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The E.S.A.'s origins date from the late 1960s as the European countries with significant space expertise -- particularly Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- began to fear being left behind as the United States and Soviet Union channeled enormous financial and technological resources into their Cold War space race. The agency receives three-fourths of its budget directly from member states and the rest from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and a handful of cooperating states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, more than 30,000 people are directly employed by the space industry and a further 300,000 people work in space-related sectors like satellite operations and an array of navigation, communications and Earth observation services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of Mr. Dordain's mission this week will be to reassure governments that the often high upfront costs of the E.S.A.'s projects, which focus heavily on developing and launching satellites for earth observation and telecommunications, deliver tangible gains for European businesses. The <span class="companylink">European Union</span> estimates, for example, that the €5 billion Galileo satellite navigation system -- a competitor to the Global Positioning System of the United States -- will generate €90 billion in economic benefits over the next 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European companies have a 40 percent share of the global market in commercial satellite launchings, and economists say the revenue they generate is roughly 20 times the cost of the launchings themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space investment, Mr. Dordain said, ''is not the man on the moon -- it is down to earth.'' While the E.S.A. has always made its main priority the pursuit of knowledge about the Earth and the solar system, the current crisis has added another: leveraging space investments to enhance the competitiveness of European companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a message, he said, that some European governments are coming to grasp. This month, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced plans to increase London's contribution to the E.S.A.'s budget by 25 percent over the next two years. The larger contribution is expected to translate into more research contracts for British companies, the fruits of which could be commercialized into new products and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most audacious space-exploration missions have yielded technologies that have later found earthbound applications in areas like mobile communications, optics, robotics, energy generation and propulsion systems. That remains the main argument for continued European participation in projects like the International Space Station and forthcoming missions to the Moon, Mars and Mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most ambitious project on Mr. Dordain's wish list is a €450 million proposal to build, together with NASA, a space vehicle that would transport up to four astronauts on missions as long as six months. Its first mission, envisioned for around 2020, would bring the first humans to the Moon since the U.S. Apollo space program ended in 1972. The spacecraft could be modified in later years for manned missions to Mars or one of the asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other proposals on the table this week include €100 million to finance the first phase of development for a robotic lander that would explore the Moon's south pole, which some scientists believe may harbor ancient deposits of ice. An initial feasibility study for the lander was awarded in 2010 to Astrium, a unit of <span class="companylink">European Aeronautic Defense &amp; Space</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have more ideas than member states have money,'' Mr. Dordain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rocket scientist who has trained as an astronaut, Mr. Dordain, 66, was in primary school when the Soviet Union lofted Sputnik in 1957. He earned his engineering degree on July 20, 1969, the day Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he continues to press the case for space investment to European leaders, he concedes that it is impossible to put a price tag on the thrill of exploration that inspired his own career -- and that the E.S.A. aims to harness by encouraging young Europeans to become scientists and engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You cannot put an economic value on providing dreams,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE voters have spoken. So, what now? How will our still divided government deal with our mounting threats and challenges?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shared fear can help.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Bedouin proverb says, ''Me against my brother, my brothers and me against my cousins, then my cousins and me against strangers.'' Human beings are pretty good at uniting to fight at whatever level is most important at a given moment. This is why every story about a team of warriors or superheroes features an internal rivalry, but all hatchets are buried just before the climactic final battle in which the team vanquishes the external enemy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national election focuses our attention on a single level of competition -- political party versus political party. Let's call that ''me and my brother against our cousin.'' But after that, it's time for our national team to come together to fight the many threats and enemies that confront us. Let's unite with our cousins to fight the stranger!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except that we didn't do it four years ago, when things looked even grimmer, and there's no sign that we're going to do it now. Since the 1990s we've been stuck at one level -- party versus party. Partisanship is not a bad thing. We need multiple teams to develop competing visions for voters to choose among. But when so many of our leaders can't even occasionally place national interest before party interest, we've crossed over into hyperpartisanship. And that's a very bad thing, because it amplifies other problems like the debt crisis, the absence of a rational immigration policy and our aging infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We the people bear some of the blame for what's happened in <span class="companylink">Congress</span>, for we, too, have become more angrily partisan. So what can we do to pull ourselves up to that higher level? How can we unite not just with our brothers and sisters, but with our cousins?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way is to focus on common threats, rather than on common ground, just as the Bedouin proverb suggests. It's only the threat of the stranger that brings the extended family together. A physical attack by outsiders -- like Pearl Harbor or 9/11 -- binds people together like nothing else. But what if there is no such attack? Can trade competition with China do it? What about a threat we created ourselves?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, that depends. A basic principle of moral psychology is that ''morality binds and blinds.'' In many pre-agricultural societies, groups achieved trust and unity by circling around sacred objects. In modern societies, much larger groups bind themselves together by treating certain books, flags, leaders or ideals as sacred and by symbolically circling around them. But if your team circles too fast, you lose the ability to see clearly or think for yourself. You go blind to evidence that contradicts your group's moral consensus, and you become enraged at teammates who suggest that the other side is not entirely bad (as New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, is now finding out).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike a foreign attack, a problem that threatens only one side's sacred values can therefore divide us, rather than unite us. It's as though a giant asteroid is headed for the Earth. One side sees it coming and screams, but the louder it screams, the more stubbornly the other side covers its ears and averts its eyes. Here are a few of the asteroids hurtling toward us, which half of us can already see with our naked eyes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising temperatures. The left has been raising the alarm about global warming since the 1990s. It's a threat to the environment and to poor people around the world -- sacred values for liberals -- but the right largely denies the scientific consensus, in part because many of the remedies would require limits on industry and intervention into markets (which would violate sacred values for some conservatives). Hurricane Sandy gave us a small taste of what's likely to happen more frequently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising entitlements. The right has railed against entitlement spending since the 1960s, and its frustration boiled over in the Tea Party movement. The welfare state is a threat to traditional conservative values of personal responsibility (people have less incentive to plan for their own future) and fiscal solvency. Despite the logical errors in Mitt Romney's ''47 percent'' comments, we do face bankruptcy when the baby boomers retire and a shrinking percentage of workers must pay the ever growing expenses of a ballooning class of retirees. Yet the Democrats want to ''protect'' older Americans, students and almost everyone else from the need to sacrifice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising inequality. The left has been protesting rising inequality since Ronald Reagan cut taxes on the rich and benefits for the poor, and a great deal of recent scholarship documents the socially, morally and economically damaging effects of separating the haves ever further from the have-nots. Nearly all the gains in productivity in the last 30 years have gone to the wealthiest, but the right justifies the trend and denies its toxicity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising births to unmarried women. In 1960, 5 percent of American children were born to unmarried women. In 2010, that number was more than 40 percent. Conservatives treat the traditional family as the irreplaceable building block of society and are therefore horrified that unmarried motherhood will soon be the national norm. The left has been ambivalent about the value of marriage (at least, before the push for gay marriage), sometimes viewing it as a patriarchal institution and reluctant to admit that a stable marriage is very good for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, America faces many serious threats, but each side sees some and denies others. Morality binds and blinds. The philosopher John Stuart Mill described this problem in 1840, noting that in almost all major ideological controversies, ''both sides were in the right in what they affirmed, though wrong in what they denied, and that if either could have been made to take the other's views in addition to its own, little more would have been needed to make its doctrine correct.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see Mill's diagnosis in action, note that marriage is disappearing primarily among Americans without a four-year college degree. Marriage confers so many benefits on children that it helps them rise into the upper tier of wealth; children who don't benefit from a stable marriage are more likely to fall. So if you are a liberal who is worried about the inequality asteroid, you might consider teaming up with a conservative group trying to promote marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then you'd run smack into the problem that women rarely want to marry a man with no job and poor prospects. So if you are a conservative who cares about the unmarried-mother asteroid, you might want to team up with liberal groups working to improve educational equality and to find ways to keep poor young men in school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we focus only on the one asteroid that most frightens us, we feel anger at the partisans on the other side. We curse their blindness without recognizing our own. But if we can look up into the sky and see a whole fleet of asteroids heading for us, we lose our tunnel vision and experience a healthy form of panic. We're in big trouble, and anyone who does that hyperpartisan stuff now should be ashamed -- or kicked out of office. The day after Election Day is the day for all of us, and our siblings and cousins, to come together and start building an asteroid deflection system.</p>

At a NASA news conference on Friday, scientists reported that the Mars rover's instruments had seen no signs of methane, which, had it been there, would have signaled that there might currently be methane-exhaling microorganisms on Mars that are similar to those found on Earth. In Martian air, methane molecules are broken down by sunlight and chemical reactions within a few hundred years. Thus, when three teams of scientists reported in 2004 that they had detected methane there, it raised the possibility that something on present-day Mars was creating methane, and the most exciting possibility was tiny life forms.</p>

A small California technology company, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, launched its cargo-carrying capsule atop its Falcon 9 rocket on Oct. 7 and almost immediately encountered a problem when one of the rocket's nine engines shut down shortly after liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mishap did not prevent the cargo from reaching the station, but it did make it impossible to place a secondary payload, a prototype communications satellite, into the proper orbit. The satellite's owner, Orbcomm, said it had achieved some useful test results before the satellite fell out of orbit and burned up in the atmosphere, so it was not a total failure. The company says it plans to launch more satellites aboard <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rockets in the future.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA was clearly pleased with the mission. Since the retirement of the space shuttle fleet last year, the agency has relied primarily on Russia to send cargo and astronauts up the space station and back. Now NASA is trying to turn over the routine tasks of carrying cargo -- and eventually, astronauts -- to the space station while it focuses its human spaceflight program on exploration of the inner solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> currently has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to carry out at least 11 more cargo resupply missions through 2016. Another company, the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., has built a new cargo spacecraft under NASA contract and is preparing for a test flight next year. The best news from this first commercial flight is that the Falcon 9 rocket was able to complete its cargo delivery mission despite the loss of an engine. Although it was not perfect, the outing shows that private companies can carry out relatively mundane tasks like space cargo transport.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was a kid, my dad taught me the science of skipping stones. There on the rocky banks of a little stream behind our house in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, he coached me not only on the proper pitching motion, but on the significance of the right equipment. While the throw was important, it was the stone itself that held the secrets to a good skip. Recently, we have found stones just like the best skippers -- 180 million miles away from Huntingdon Valley. These stones are on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the chief scientist for NASA's Curiosity Mars rover, locating such a smooth and flat rock on the Red Planet means water once flowed there -- and nothing could be more important. It means that we sent our plutonium-powered, S.U.V.-sized, six-wheeled, science-instrumented vehicle to the right place.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting early confirmation that we came to the right place is a huge deal -- and it has come early in the mission. We landed Curiosity on Aug. 5 on a place on Mars called Gale Crater. We've logged more than two months operating the most technologically advanced vehicle in all of recorded history, and we have about two years left in our prime mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is our prime mission? We built Curiosity to investigate whether conditions could have been favorable for microbial life and for preserving clues in the rocks about possible past life. On Earth, wherever you find water you find life. Not having liquid water present on the surface of Mars now means we need to look into its history for a time when water ranged across the surface. Which leads me back to Gale Crater, which is bone dry, and why it relates to our skipping stones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, we know skipping stones don't end up on a shore or beach by accident. It's Mother Nature who places them there after a long and bumpy journey that could take millions of years and cover hundreds of miles. Part of the reason we know this is because skipping stones don't start out looking and feeling like skipping stones. They begin their life like most other rocks, jagged shards of material somehow sheared away from the Earth's crust by the movement of tectonic plates or by erosion. The difference is, they are exposed to a moving fluid for an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its water-propelled journey here on Earth, our rock is pummeled by particles and thrown into obstructions only to be pushed farther along by the force of water. Each impact it endures, however minute, leaves its mark. Many years later, the rock has been transformed into the smooth-surfaced creation that begs to be flung at a low angle across the water. In the geology world this process is known as abrasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when we see rounded rocks on Mars we know that at that location a river ran through it, at some point in its history. From the size and the shapes of the mixture of stones found together come clues to the speed of the water flow and the distance that the stones have traveled to reach their present location. Working the data we have received so far, we believe the water source that propelled our skipping stone to its present location was anywhere from ankle to hip-deep and flowed at about 3 feet per second. The distance traveled and the source of the water is unknown, but in my mind's eye I can picture the different scenarios that could bring that little stone into existence. And to a planetary geologist, each and every one of them has its own inner and outer beauty. Perhaps one day, our insatiable Curiosity will help us learn which of these scenarios is correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, we've put our skipping stones in the rover's rearview mirror (several of our 17 cameras watched them disappear over the horizon) and moved forward in both time and space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just the other day, we crossed another significant threshold of the mission by processing our first sample of Mars in one of Curiosity's onboard chemistry labs. Essentially, we're eating dirt and loving it. With this step, we've begun doing the kind of exacting scientific research you would usually only be able to accomplish in a fully stocked laboratory at a university or research center. Now, we're doing it on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What these findings will tell us we're not sure. But we do know that Gale Crater, the skipping stones and the baby aspirin-sized sample of Martian dirt the rover just ingested all have a story to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norman Maclean wrote in his seminal work, ''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories'': ''Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our waters may be over a hundred million miles away and over a thousand million years back in time from the Big Blackfoot River Maclean was referring to, but that makes little difference. Those of us working on NASA's Curiosity mission are haunted by waters as well. Where those ancient waters lead us remains to be seen, but they provide us with our roadmap. Now it's just up to our instruments and our patience with a few detours if we feel the need to explore tributaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagine that the pursuit of this clear liquid and the stories and worlds it helps recreate will go on well beyond our rover's mission. That someday, an astronaut may very well walk in the treaded footsteps of Curiosity and find these stones or ones like them. When that day happens, 180 million miles away from home, in Gale Crater or elsewhere on the planet of Mars, for at least a moment, they might think back to their own simpler time when, on the shoreline of some body of water, they first learned the value of the perfect stone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, I imagine, they'll get back to work because on Mars there is a lot to see, a lot to do, and a lot to learn.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The theater of the daredevil's jump had a deliberate déjà vu quality, evoking the heady dawn of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were the neat rows of concerned people at computers, resembling NASA's mission control in Houston. The calm voice on earth guiding a cryptic, staticky voice in the heavens. The picture of Earth spinning below. The puffy white suit and bulbous helmet. The utterance of one of those telegraphic banalities that become profound when issued from the dark beyond.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Felix Baumgartner fell back to us from more than 128,000 feet, or 39,000 meters, above, watched by millions, it was less a reprise of space age glory than a reminder of how different glory can be in our own time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different in two ways in particular. The endeavor, like so many endeavors in an age of tired, broke and austere governments, was a triumph of private rather than collective ambitions. And it was a triumph that seemed to belong to no one place but all the world -- and as a result also belonged to no one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iconic letters of the early years of space travel -- USA for the Americans, CCCP for the Soviets -- gave way to new letters this time: they spelled ''Red Bull,'' for the energy drink company (which, like Mr. Baumgartner, is Austrian) that sponsored the expedition and reaped its payback in endless mentions in glowing news coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new letters underlined how space travel has changed in the nation that first put a man on the moon. With NASA ending the Space Shuttle program and refocusing on orchestrating private missions, such work seems likely to go the way of sports stadiums and television shows. It will, more and more, be brought to you by somebody selling something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Baumgartner landed in the New Mexico desert after his free fall, his costume mimicked Neil Armstrong's. But the ensuing moments disrupted the analogy. His double fist pump was the gesture of a sports hero, not a man just returned from ''the edge of space,'' as the marketing materials phrased it. The organizers had ensured that, before anything else, a photographer alighted from a helicopter and got the money shots for a planet of eager fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Baumgartner's relationship with viewers was intimate, with the audience hearing him breathe and pant as he fell, it was also strangely solitary, as though viewers were merely voyeurs and not also participants. It came across so differently from the old television footage of the moon landing in 1969, when Mr. Armstrong's ''small step'' seemed to be taken on behalf of every human who could not be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Armstrong was, of course, representing a country. He was a mere servant of a public mission voted, paid and cheered for by the American people. Mr. Baumgartner was on a much humbler mission, and it was structured as a private project, not unlike your typical global company -- based in one place, with talent from some other places and funding from other places still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this more fragmentary kind of mission is good or bad depends on where you stand. Space seems likely to become yet another corner of the global market, with free individuals coming together spontaneously to pursue projects in their mutual interest. That, to some, might seem vulgar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you're an Indonesian and the brightest astronaut mind of your generation, the 1960s wouldn't have been a great time to grow up. In this more fragmentary and open world, you might get to leave earth on a vessel built by Japanese, financed by Russians, guided from the ground by Americans and launched from Colombian soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet things so diffuse in their provenance can struggle to inspire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions watched Mr. Baumgartner fall. But because the project belonged to the whole world, it didn't much belong to anyone. People watched on their phones, their tablets, their laptops -- on devices built for one -- and on television, too. Some watched live; others, later. But the event lacked the emotive force it seemed designed to set off. There was none of the patriotism that can attend such things, because Mr. Baumgartner was presented as Red Bull's sky-jumping man, not Austria's, America's or anyplace else's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It reminded me of the new stadium near where I live in New York. It's not called Brooklyn Stadium, but rather Barclays Center. It involves a partnership among an American real-estate tycoon, a rapper from the neighborhood, a British bank, a basketball team imported from New Jersey and a Russian billionaire. They are working to make Brooklynites feel it is their own, but it strikes many as being not quite that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is in all this a kind of historical return. Many hundred years ago, before the nation-state had risen and perfected its tax-and-spend prowess, many of the boldest human doings were of the brought-to-you-by variety -- sponsored by private families like the Medicis, feudal overlords, clans and tribes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation-state allowed for undertakings, like the investigation of space, that eclipsed what private ambition could achieve. But in a more fluid, interconnected world, in this age of private ascendancy and public contraction, that older type of striving is back. We may again know times in which the greatest human endeavors are private ones -- thrilling, mesmerizing even, and not quite ours.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDBringing the search for another Earth about as close as it will ever get, a team of European astronomers was scheduled to announce on Wednesday that it had found a planet the same mass as Earth's in Alpha Centauri, a triple star system that is the Sun's closest neighbor, only 4.4 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is the lightest one ever found orbiting another star and -- in the words of its discoverer, Xavier Dumusque, a graduate student at the Geneva Observatory -- ''it will surely be the closest one ever.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is presumably a rocky ball like our own, but it is not habitable. It circles Alpha Centauri B, a reddish orb about half as luminous as the Sun, every three days at a distance of only about four million miles, resulting in hellish surface temperatures of 1,200 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this is not ''Earth 2.0.'' Yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the discovery raised the possibility that there were habitable Earthlike planets right next door and that methods and instruments were now precise enough to detect them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very small planets are not rare,'' said Mr. Dumusque, who is the lead author of a paper being published on Wednesday in Nature. ''When you find one small planet, you find others.'' He and his colleagues discussed the results on Tuesday in a news conference hosted by the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> in Garching, Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers were electrified by the news of the planet, but also cautioned that it needed confirmation by other astronomers, not an easy task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Fischer, a Yale astronomer who has been searching for planets in that same system for years, said: ''The discovery that our nearest neighbor has rocky planets is the story of the decade. I'd bet $100 that there are other planets that are there as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery also underscored the allure of Alpha Centauri as a target of space and scientific exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is close enough you can almost spit there,'' said Geoffrey Marcy, an exoplanet astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an e-mail, ''I feel like we should drop everything and send a probe there to study the new planet and others that are likely in the system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three stars in that system. Alpha Centauri A, which is slightly larger and brighter than the Sun, and Alpha Centauri B, slightly smaller, are close companions, circling each other and passing as close as 900 million miles every 80 years. They in turn are being circled at a much greater distance, some one trillion miles, by a dwarf star that is known as Proxima Centauri because it is slightly closer to the Earth, due to that trillion miles, than the other two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called habitable zone of Alpha Centauri B, where temperatures would be moderate enough for water and creatures like us, is about 65 million miles from the star, where a year would take 200 days or so, about the same as the orbit of Venus in our own system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dumusque and his colleagues found the planet by the so-called wobble method, using a specially built spectrograph called HARPS on a 140-inch diameter telescope at the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> in La Silla, Chile, to track the host star as it is tugged to and fro by the planet's gravity. After four years and 450 observations, they found that in the case of Alpha Centauri B, that tug imparts a velocity of about 20 inches a second, a leisurely walking speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the smallest wobble the Swiss team has ever observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A planet only four times as massive as the Earth would produce the same amount of wobble if it was out in the habitable zone and would thus be detectable by their instrument, Mr. Dumusque said. But it would take a long time. ''If you want to find a planet at 200 days,'' he said referring to the orbital period, ''you need 8 to 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy said this was the kind of discovery that could reignite interest in other experiments like the Terrestrial Planet Finder, a space observatory for studying exoplanets that was once at the top of NASA's wish list but is now languishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Dr. Marcy startled his colleagues at an M.I.T. symposium with a bitter criticism of NASA, the National Academy of Sciences and the planetary community itself for failing to define and sell advanced exoplanet missions. He went on to call for an international project to launch a scientific probe to Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could take hundreds of years, but such a mission, Dr. Marcy said, could jolt NASA out of its doldrums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet, Dr. Marcy said, ''fits right into that rant.'' He went on, ''What a great scientific educational mission to have a probe out there, making its way decade after decade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 19, 2012, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a new planet discovered in the Alpha Centauri system misstated the distance between Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, the two main stars in the triple-star system. Every 80 years, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B pass within about 900 million miles of each other -- not nine billion miles.</p>
