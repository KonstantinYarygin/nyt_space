<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 294 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to forget how amazing modern medicine is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When my mother's grandmother was born, there were no antibiotics, no antisepsis and, except for smallpox, no vaccinations. There were no X-rays, no IVs or EKGs. There was no anesthesia. When the English novelist Fanny Burney underwent a mastectomy in 1811, she was awake. ''I mounted, therefore, unbidden, the Bed stead,'' she wrote to her sister. ''When the dreadful steel was plunged into the breast -- cutting through veins -- arteries -- flesh -- nerves -- I needed no injunctions not to restrain my cries. . . . Oh Heaven! -- I then felt the Knife rackling against the breast bone -- scraping it!'' Simple appendicitis was often fatal, and the average age of death in England in 1840 was 41, not because people aged more quickly but because so many died of disease and accidents first. Then, in the mid-19th century, discoveries and inventions began pouring into medicine. Today we have the medical care previous societies only dreamed of -- painless surgery, treatments for infections, marvelous mechanical aids for the disabled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''Extreme Medicine,'' Kevin Fong, an honorary lecturer in physiology at <span class="companylink">University College London</span> who has worked with NASA and trained in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine, surveys how far medicine has come in the treatment of hypothermia, severe burns, heart disease, lung disease, complex trauma care, viral epidemics. This ''is a book about life: its fragility, its fractal beauty and its resilience,'' he writes. ''It is about a century during which our expectations of life transformed beyond all recognition, when we took what was routinely fatal and made it survivable . . . this exploration of the human body was no less extreme than our forays in the physical world.'' In fact, his premise is that the cause of this transformation in medicine was exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fong structures his book chronologically. He begins with the explorer Robert Falcon Scott's death by freezing in Antarctica in 1912 and ends with the medical issues presented by a future manned trip to Mars. Each chapter is made up of linked sections and stories told enthusiastically at a fast pace. It's a particular style -- casual, choppy, visual. ''Extreme Medicine'' is fun to read, but it doesn't read like a book. It has episodes not chapters. It's broad not deep, and it doesn't develop so much as unroll. For example, the chapter on Mars begins with Fong's arrival as an intern at NASA. It cuts to the physiology of weightlessness, then back to his experience in an antigravity lab, on to the physiology of gravity, and concludes with NASA's decision to reduce the Mars budget (''Once again the Red Planet receded into the future'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I could almost see the animated Red Planet moving away from us in space and hear the voice-over. It felt more like watching a PBS documentary than reading a book, and I wondered if it had started out as a television show. In fact, Fong presents several of the book's stories, themes and expositions on a BBC series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I did have to ratchet down my expectations. Rather than develop an argument, ''Extreme Medicine'' is a moving picture of dramatic historical moments, explanatory pauses and Fong's real-life experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also had to change my expectations of the writing. Fong weaves much of the text out of clichés; for instance, in a few pages we read about ''drug-fueled gang wars,'' a city that ''jockeys for position,'' ''shady characters'' and ''a thick Colombian accent.'' The language can be clumsy -- ''The absence of gravitational load takes on a new dimension, transforming from a novelty into a creeping threat'' -- sometimes so much so that meaning is lost. For instance: ''The layers of epidermal cells, constantly being born and marching forward, are like a never-ending conveyor belt of foot soldiers throwing themselves at the wire.'' I had to read the sentence three times to understand that it was referring to the layer of cells that divide, grow and move up to the surface of the skin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Fong's comparisons are odd, though vivid. The cell membrane is like the chief executive of a budget airline; the cell is like a walled city with power stations and industrial estates; the spleen is like a quality control officer monitoring a production line. Others are confusing: ''The cells of the immune system roam the bloodstream and tissues, like policemen pacing the beat.'' Are they like British bobbies with billy clubs, then, keeping peace in our bloodstreams firmly but kindly? Or are they, perhaps, American boys in blue, with fierce expressions and guns, shooting holes in wayward bacteria?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor was I won over by Fong's premise -- that exploration transformed medicine. He doesn't provide much evidence; he mainly draws parallels between the two. So, medical researchers push against frontiers and cross ''chasms.'' Doctors ''conquer'' the virgin territory of the heart, and a surgeon ''narrates his exploration like a mountaineer describing a new route.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although exploring did lead to some technological advances, what caused the transformation of medicine in the 20th century was a powerful and complex interplay between machines, industrialization and war. It was the terrible disfigurements suffered by World War I pilots as they used the newly invented airplane that gave us plastic surgery. The revolution in the care of multiple trauma happened because of automobile accidents, helicopter accidents and industrial explosions. Echocardiography came out of using sonar to locate submarines; and chemotherapy started with our learning about the physiological effects of chemical weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Fong tells a good story, and in this time of unrelenting criticism of our medical system, we need to be reminded of how much we've learned in the past hundred years, how much we know, how miraculous it all is, what a blessing.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- If cities had genders, Paris would almost surely be a woman. So much about it seems feminine: the sensuous curves of the Seine around which it is built, the ubiquitous concern for the cut of a coat, the elegance of its cityscape. And now, Paris is on the eve of electing its first female mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two leading candidates are Anne Hidalgo, 54, and Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, 40: both women, both with ambitious plans for Paris, both with government experience, and both willing to fight for a job that has often been a steppingstone to higher office.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first round of municipal elections nationwide will be held Sunday, with a runoff a week later in places where no candidate has won a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is, after all, the conquest of Paris -- this is a symbol,'' said Mariette Sineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po who has written a book on women and power in France. ''We are going to see a woman in this post, and this will make things move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The candidates have criticized each other's ideas, but many of their differences are more about style than substance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the campaign, a member of Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet's team was quoted as saying the race was between ''a star and a concierge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hidalgo retorted, ''Being mayor of Paris is to love the concierges and the stars, because I know that the concierges are the stars of our daily life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, one of the few prominent women in the conservative Union for a Popular Movement party, has a glamorous air and intense intelligence. She comes from a well-heeled family with deep roots in France and Polish ancestry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hidalgo, of the Socialist Party, has been the first deputy to the current mayor, Bertrand Delanoë, for 13 years. She came to France from Spain as a child, has an immigrant's passion for her adopted country and comes off as more down to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Hidalgo is leading in the polls, analysts expect a runoff. The French do not vote directly for mayoral candidates but for City Council members, who then elect the mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each woman sees herself as the inheritor of the Paris created by Mr. Delanoë, who left a visible stamp on the city through popular programs to share bicycles and electric cars, temporary beaches on the Seine and the reclamation of green space. Although Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet is from the opposing party, she told reporters she would continue many of Mr. Delanoë's policies while also writing ''a new page.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hidalgo, however, as one of Mr. Delanoë's deputies, can explicitly claim to be inheriting his mantle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The candidates ''represent a new generation of women in politics,'' said Marie-Ève Malouines, chief political editor at Radio France Info, who wrote a book on the race. Earlier generations ''tried to adopt the codes of men,'' she said, but Ms. Hidalgo and Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet have kept their ''female attributes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both mix with ordinary Parisians and seem eager to emphasize that they, too, live in the city. Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, clad in jeans or in fashionable jackets, pants and boots, sets up tables near subway stops and puts out soda and juice to serve to passers-by as she and her supporters buttonhole them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hidalgo, often more conservatively dressed, has a penchant for going to outdoor markets to shake hands with voters as they buy salad and cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their resolute informality appears to be partly an effort to reach a disaffected electorate. Support for President François Hollande, a Socialist, is at a historic low, and the U.M.P., led by Nicolas Sarkozy when he was president, is besieged by scandals. Nationwide, the most gains in the municipal elections are likely to go to the far-right National Front, which promotes itself as the only alternative to politics as usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''I'm just an ordinary Parisian'' image fits Ms. Hidalgo a bit better than Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who is from an affluent family on the Left Bank of the Seine and can seem as though she is trying too hard. She famously fumbled when a French reporter asked her the price of a subway ticket, though she had waxed poetic in an interview with Elle magazine about the ''incredible encounters'' and ''moments of grace'' offered by riding the subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she can also be eloquent. At a recent rally she told supporters: ''A city that looks like a museum, it's beautiful, but Parisians deserve better. They must have the past, but they must also be able to seize the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet was one of the relatively few women at the time to graduate from the École Polytechnique, one of France's most competitive universities. Aides who worked with her in the National Assembly recalled Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet's bringing her son to work days after his birth and typing with one hand while feeding him with the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hidalgo has more working-class roots and became a French citizen as a teenager, embracing the republican ideal. As a labor inspector she worked closely with unions, in a position widely viewed as that of a functionary, while making her way up within the Socialist Party. She focused on gender equality and then infrastructure. Part of her mayoral plan is to increase low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She can come across as a technocrat, able to hold forth on almost any question of city governance, but she also has an obvious enthusiasm for her adopted country and city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to make Paris an open city that is nourished by people's differences,'' she recently told a crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hidalgo appears to be focused on governing Paris, while Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet has long-range ambitions. She is often cited as a potential presidential candidate in 2017 and wants to shake up the old-boy network that dominates right-wing politics in Paris, said Michaël Darmon, chief political editor at the news network i-Télé.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing else, the race has helped to underscore that women can compete for political offices by talking mostly about the issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The adage which says that women do politics differently is wrong,'' Mr. Darmon said. ''Power has no gender.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Many of the photos illustrating the Milky Way are actually top or bottom views of other presumably similar galaxies.

Another stand-in has been the neighboring Andromeda galaxy, or Messier 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A satellite image of the Milky Way from within the galaxy shows some indications of its structure. A groundbreaking panoramic view was made in 1990 by the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite, capturing near-infrared wavelengths of light in a time exposure. It shows the central bulge of stars as a bright spot placed at the middle of a thin line that represents the sparser collection reaching out in either direction. If this image were wrapped around the viewer, it would be very close to how an edge-on view of a spiral galaxy would appear.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year's appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,'' Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Dr. Guth's starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> detected ripples in the fabric of space-time -- so-called gravitational waves -- the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac's work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'As Big as It Gets'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac's ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Kamionkowski of <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span>, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, ''This is huge, as big as it gets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He continued, ''This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself ''bowled over,'' saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With nature, you have to be lucky,'' he said. ''Apparently we have been lucky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years' worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,'' said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac's team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,'' Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. ''Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, ''I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John E. Carlstrom of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>, Dr. Kovac's mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. ''I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,'' Dr. Krauss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirals in the Sky</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the <span class="companylink">University of Minnesota</span>, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,'' Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. ''I've been hooked ever since,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group's telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had no expectations what we would see,'' Dr. Kovac said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Special Time</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the universe could ''supercool'' and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold -- from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit -- in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today's observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. ''It's often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,'' Dr. Guth likes to say, ''but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth's original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you trace your cosmic roots,'' said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-<span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> astronomer who was not part of the team, ''you wind up at inflation.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- It was party time at the Planet Labs satellite factory, in an unkempt office in the trendy South of Market neighborhood here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man in a blue tuxedo shared pancakes with about two dozen young engineers at the space start-up. The air was filled with the smell of bacon and the voices of Russian and Japanese astronauts. The astronauts communicated over a video hookup to the International Space Station, 230 miles above the kitchen, one morning last month.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we're going to push the boundaries,'' said Chester Gillmore, the company's director of manufacturing. He was referring to his cooking skills, but he could just as well have been talking about his 40-employee company, which has already put dozens of small satellites in space. Once they are connected, they will be able to provide near-constant images of what is going on back on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, Mr. Gillmore believes, could be the basis of a very good business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley, not content with changing how retailers, taxi companies and hotels do business, is taking its disruptive ways into outer space. Several young companies with roots in Silicon Valley are trying to elbow their way into a business long dominated by national governments and aeronautics giants like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, started by the Tesla founder Elon Musk, is already a contractor for NASA, running supply missions to the International Space Station. Another start-up, <span class="companylink">Masten Space Systems</span>, with headquarters in Mojave, Calif., is developing rockets designed for unmanned research flights. Skybox Imaging, based in Mountain View, Calif., makes satellites similar to those of Planet Labs, though they are significantly larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These start-ups have one thing in common: They think they can undercut the old guard with lower prices and smarter thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Planet Labs staff ate pancakes that morning in February, two shoebox-size nine-pound pods made in the company's unconventional factory floated from the International Space Station toward a polar orbit of Earth. Ten hours later, two more were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan was to launch two to four a day, for a configuration of 28 satellites. The small, basic devices with solar panels and simple maneuvering equipment and radios are expected to last two to four years and are capable of taking weekly photos with details as small as a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is just the start. Last week, Planet Labs announced that it would put about 100 satellites into space from the United States and Russia, bringing the total number of ''Doves,'' as the company calls them, to 131. That larger network, which Planet Labs hopes to complete within a year, is expected to create a daily photo mosaic of most of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mosaic could be valuable to private customers, like agricultural companies monitoring farmlands, or even to governments trying to figure out how to aid natural disaster victims. The company has so far booked contracts worth more than the $65 million in private equity it has raised, according to Will Marshall, the company's co-founder and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from what he calls a ''clean-ish room,'' separated from the kitchen by some loose plastic sheets, Mr. Gillmore and a small team are working on newer versions of the lightweight satellites, adjusting and improving them with the frequency you would normally see at a software company. The satellites now in space are the seventh version; versions eight through 10, which are expected to cost less and do more, are being assembled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These satellites are powered by batteries normally found in a laptop, with semiconductors similar to those in a smartphone. ''Nothing here was prequalified to be in space,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''We bought most of our parts online.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planet Labs will not disclose its manufacturing costs, but potential customers who have seen the products think the satellites are approximately 95 percent cheaper than most satellites, a figure Mr. Marshall would neither confirm nor dispute. ''We leverage the billions of dollars spent on the consumer mobile phone business'' for most of the company's parts, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launch costs, which are mostly based on weight and distance above the planet, are also lower. All 28 satellites together weigh about 126 pounds and can easily hitch a ride on rockets carrying other space cargo. In comparison, a single Landsat, a popular Earth-imaging satellite, weighs 4,566 pounds and flies twice as high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With these small, inexpensive satellites, ''we'll eventually be able to see anything on the planet. Anything,'' said Chris Boshuizen, co-founder and chief technology officer at Planet Labs. ''We'll be able to tell you what something looked like the day before, the day of and the day after an event.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planet Labs was founded in 2010 by three scientists who worked at NASA. Mr. Boshuizen is Australian, while Mr. Marshall is British. The third, Robbie Schingler, is an American who is the company's chief operating officer. Like many tech entrepreneurs, all three grew tired of the conventional way things were built -- in this case, space products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the cost of designing, building, launching and monitoring the government's Landsat satellite, which takes pictures of Earth from 480 miles up, is over $1 billion, according to the <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span>, which administers data from the satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking into a field dominated by big companies with long government contracts is tough to do. And doing it cheaply is even harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In designing their satellites, Planet Labs threw out things like propulsion systems, because of the high cost and weight. Instead, the satellites use commercial light sensors, accelerometers and motors to orient their cameras. Laptop batteries were chosen because a more expensive version cost too much. Plus, they fit inside the satellite's frame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By making little machines that are often updated, Mr. Gillmore said, ''we're building satellites with computers that are six months old. Lots of satellites have 10-year-old computers.'' Version nine, which is almost complete, cost about 35 percent less than the current version in space, and was made four times faster, he estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> be worried? Not yet, said James P. Lloyd, associate professor of astronomy and mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University. Professor Lloyd said he believed the space market was big enough for expensive <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> systems and cheaper alternatives from start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Essentially anybody can do it, because a combination of miniaturization, simplification and availability of technology for building small satellites has made it accessible in a way that has never been before,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while Planet Labs can beat older competitors on price, those expensive features do matter, said David Friedberg, chief executive of Climate, an agricultural data analysis firm owned by <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span>. <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> buys data from several older imaging satellites, he said, but is not a Planet Labs customer because it does not yet offer the infrared imagery needed to judge the health of plants. ''Their real competition may be drones,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Marshall is confident that his fast and cheap method will hold its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the rapid prototyping, like you see with software, taken into space,'' he said. ''We can see rivers changing course. We can count individual trees.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 29, Randall Munroe still revels in a recent honor that can resemble a lifetime achievement award -- an asteroid in orbit between Jupiter and Mars and once known simply as 4942 was renamed last year by the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> as 4942 Munroe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a generation of computer programmers, astrophysicists and other scientists, Mr. Munroe and his online comic, xkcd, have been lodestars. There are the clever riffs and jokes about computers codes and the culture of the Internet that only someone steeped in those worlds can fully understand illustrated by stick-figure characters who show their humanity even as they are absorbed by numbers and paradoxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Munroe is about to explore a strange new world -- mainstream publishing -- and seek out an audience that doesn't know its Linux from its Lexus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</span> announced this week that it would be publishing a book written and illustrated by Mr. Munroe based on a side project on the xkcd website called ''What If?'' Though the book won't appear for six months, ''What If?'' quickly reached No. 2 on Amazon's best-seller list on the strength of pre-orders, trailing only a history book from Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept behind ''What If?'' is that Mr. Munroe faithfully follows (out the window and often into the stratosphere) bizarre premises suggested by his readers: What if a rainstorm fell as a single, enormous drop? What if everyone on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon, would it change color? If all the tea in the world were dumped into the Great Lakes, how strong would the brew be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basically, he said in a telephone interview, some readers of his comic began sending in questions: ''Hey, you do science comics, you might be a good person to ask. And it gets in your head and you can't drop it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To illustrate this point, Mr. Munroe referred to one of his xkcd comics -- ''Nerd Sniping.'' In that comic, a malevolent soul proposes holding up a complicated question on a placard as a scientist crosses the street. The scientist says, ''Hmm. Interesting. Maybe if you start with ...,'' until ''FOOM!'' a truck splatters the scientist on the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That splattered scientist could be him, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Doing 'What If?' has gotten me doing more science research than I did for my degree,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courtney Young, who is Mr. Munroe's editor at <span class="companylink">Houghton Mifflin</span>, compared him to the cartoonist Allie Brosh and the photographer Brandon Stanton, who both built huge audiences online and later became print bestsellers. ''Our expectations started very high and continue to go higher,'' she said after learning about the spike of interest on Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years earlier, Ms. Young said, she tried to get a book -- any book -- from Mr. Munroe, writing an unsolicited email to him when she was at Penguin. She was a fan, she explained, dating to her time as a technical writer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab. Mr. Munroe, who also had worked for NASA, instead decided to, in essence, self-publish a collection of his comics that were also available online. Even so, that book sold more than 100,000 copies, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''What If?,'' about a third of the book will be original content that won't appear online, Mr. Munroe said. ''I like the idea of making a bunch of cool stuff in this book,'' he said. ''I am not against the idea of selling things -- I've been used to putting things on the Internet because that's always how I've done it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Young heard that Mr. Munroe was considering going to a traditional book publisher, ''I tried to buy it before there was a proposal -- I ran to my publisher and got as much money as I could to just throw at him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said <span class="companylink">Houghton Mifflin</span>'s ''challenge is getting people's eyeballs on it,'' adding, ''He doesn't need to change to reach a wider audience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book and the comic are more than just science and research, of course. There is humor, vulnerability and art, of a sort. (The name xkcd isn't short for anything, the site explains, ''it's just a word with no phonetic pronunciation.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Munroe's stick figures, frequently seated in front of a screen, test boundaries, take the virtual world a bit too seriously, are oddly empathetic. As when one stick figure stands before a keypad and types in 1 minute and 59 seconds, saying he has adjusted his cooking times ever since hearing the simile ''as neglected as the 9 button on the microwave.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of the tech and science communities where most of his fans reside, he said: ''You have all this stereotyping -- you must not date, or have your heart broken or have any of this real life stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked how his drawing style had evolved over the years, Mr. Munroe said, ''I guess my stick figures have gotten more consistent.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, on the day of the Paris premiere of ''The Dance of Reality,'' his first movie in 23 years, Alejandro Jodorowsky, the Chilean-born filmmaker, learned that he was now an asteroid -- 261690 Jodorowsky -- as the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> had named a three-mile-wide chunk of rock orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. For a man whose life has been defined by cosmic ambitions, the honor seemed almost expected.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jodorowsky is now 85, but he remains spry and intense. I visited him two days after the premiere in his professorial apartment near the Place de la Bastille, a book-and-plant-filled domain he shares with his third wife, Pascale Montandon-Jodorowsky, who is 43 years his junior. He'd spent the day writing poetry and, in his role as a spiritual guru, tweeting tarot-card readings and ''psychomagical'' advice to his nearly one million followers. ''My son Adan told me: 'Look, this is the literature of the future. They answer you, they argue. If they're not interested, they delete you. They steal from you, it's something alive!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jodorowsky was already thinking about his next film project. ''When I'm not creating something, I get bored, I despair,'' he said. From a poster on the wall behind his desk stared a younger, wild-eyed and frizzy-haired version of Jodorowsky as the black-leather-clad gunfighter with no name who is reborn as a kind of avenging Buddha in his 1970 cult classic, ''El Topo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Written, directed, scored by and starring Jodorowsky, ''El Topo'' was an ultraviolent Western with a potent mix of Eastern spirituality and European art house surrealism. For six months, beginning on Dec. 18, 1970, it played once a day at the Elgin Cinema in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, at midnight (1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday) -- selling out virtually all its screenings and attracting a heady crowd of hippie-intellectual royalty. Dennis Hopper saw ''El Topo,'' loved it and recruited Jodorowsky to recut his next film. John Lennon saw it, returned several times and persuaded his manager, Allen Klein, to buy the distribution rights. Reviewers squabbled. The New York Times's chief film critic, Vincent Canby, dismissed ''El Topo'' as a garish con, calling it a ''rather grotesque, ego-salving San Simeon.'' Another Times critic, Peter Schjeldahl, celebrated the film as ''a vastly complex, genuinely profound comic allegory -- a sort of bloody Latin American 'Peer Gynt.' '' Ken Rudolph from The Los Angeles Free Press was more to the point, calling ''El Topo'' ''the greatest film ever made.'' Jodorowsky had his own take: ''If you are great, 'El Topo' is a great picture. If you are limited, 'El Topo' is limited.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the decades after the fabled run of ''El Topo,'' for which Jodorowsky was christened the ''father of the midnight movie,'' he faded in and out of the American cultural consciousness. After making his even more surreal follow-up, ''The Holy Mountain'' (with gender-bending actors he found at Max's Kansas City in New York), Jodorowsky had a falling out with his backer, Klein, leading to a three-decade embargo on his two most famous films. During those years, he completed only three more movies: two less personal features that he disowned and one masterful Mexican horror parable, ''Santa Sangre.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'' 'El Topo' and 'Holy Mountain' were just legends and myths,'' Nicolas Winding Refn, the director of ''Drive,'' told me. ''You could read about Jodorowsky through a few books and magazines, but his films were basically inaccessible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade, as Jodorowsky's early movies re-entered circulation, rumors occasionally surfaced about soon-to-be-produced projects -- the goth rocker Marilyn Manson was set to star in an ''El Topo'' sequel; the actor Nick Nolte was circling a ''metaphysical gangster movie'' called ''King Shot'' -- but nothing ever came to be. Jodorowsky's sometimes shady moneymen always backed out. He once told The Wall Street Journal: ''I found Russian producers. I don't want to say their names . . . [but they] disappeared after three months, and I didn't have an explanation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now Jodorowsky the filmmaker is legitimately back. ''Jodorowsky's Dune,'' a documentary by the American director Frank Pavich about Jodorowsky's two-year quest to adapt the Frank Herbert science-fiction novel, and ''The Dance of Reality,'' a trippy but big-hearted reimagining of the young Alejandro's unhappy childhood in a Chilean town, will each make its stateside debut this spring (on March 21 and May 23). As the rapper Kanye West, whose ''Yeezus'' tour was inspired by ''The Holy Mountain,'' put it last November to a packed (and very likely perplexed) house at Brooklyn's Barclays Center: ''I don't know if . . . y'all ever heard about Jodorowsky, the director. . . . Y'all don't know who the [expletive] he is. . . . Everybody copied off him. . . . And there's gonna be [expletives] in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone wondering what Jodorowsky has been doing since his previous movie, ''The Rainbow Thief'' -- a bust of a Peter O'Toole-Omar Sharif vehicle from 1990 -- would find the answer in his overstuffed apartment. Shelves of ''The Incal,'' ''The Metabarons'' and other comics he wrote line the entryway. Books on tarot, philosophy and religion are stacked eight rows high in his study. Posters of his films and portraits of his family decorate many of his walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I waited 22 years to make a film, but not sitting here in this seat,'' he said to me in his baritone Spanish. ''I did 40 books, 80 comics, theater performances, exhibitions of my drawings, tarot courses -- ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Did you wonder whether you'd make another movie?'' I asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No, no. It was: 'I'm going to make another movie. There's time. I'm going to live long enough, and it doesn't matter if I wait 20 years. I can wait.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jodorowsky's work has always focused on transformations, and as we sat in his study, he began to tell me why. ''I've seen 'Hamlet' many times, and Hamlet, he was just a hideous neurotic, he never changes. He doubts -- all the way to the end, all the way until when he dies, he doubts. Don Quixote, in Cervantes, is Don Quixote. He never changes. These heroes are identical, and they don't change. And to me it seemed that it shouldn't be that way. If you want to make a work, you need to have heroes like the universe that go on exploding and growing.'' He made clear that he saw himself on a similar trajectory. ''Between who I was and who I am now, there's 1,000 years,'' he said. ''One thousand years!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his ''El Topo'' days, Jodorowsky was, he would later say, a ''psychological killer'' who ''was not able to love.'' He was tough, unsparing and prone to visions of grandeur. ''Maybe I am a prophet,'' he said in 1973. ''I really hope one day there will come Confucius, Muhammad, Buddha and Christ to see me. And we will sit at a table, taking tea and eating some brownies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wondering how much he has really changed, I asked Montandon-Jodorowsky, who designed the costumes for ''The Dance of Reality,'' what he was like on the set. ''With me in the private life, I know the very delicate person that he is, but in shooting, he's terrible!'' she said. ''Terrible! Everybody scares. He knows what he wants and says it very clearly, so people who are not secure take this like an aggression. For doing so strong a piece of art, you have to be strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jodorowsky grew up in Tocopilla, Chile, a copper-mining town wedged on a barren mountainside above the Pacific, 900 miles north of Santiago. The son of Russian-Jewish parents -- his father was a Stalin-loving disciplinarian who ran a general store called Casa Ukrania, and his mother was a distant woman who forced her son to wear his hair long in memory of her deceased father -- Jodorowsky sought escape in the theater from a young age. By his early 20s, he was leading a 30-person avant-garde performance troupe. At 23, decamping South America for Paris, he fell in with the mime Marcel Marceau (Jodorowsky conceived ''The Cage'') and co-founded a new performance collective, the Panic Movement. (Among their Grand Guignol-esque works was the four-hour ''Sacramental Melodrama,'' which called for Jodorowsky to slit the throats of two live geese, manipulate a dismembered cow's head and symbolically castrate a rabbi.) In 1960, he moved to Mexico, where he spent a wildly prolific decade directing more than 100 plays, writing a controversial comic strip, training with a Zen monk and directing his riot-inducing first feature, ''Fando y Lis.'' (The film was banned in Mexico.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon to follow were ''El Topo,'' and ''The Holy Mountain,'' which was a smash hit in Europe. By that point, Jodorowsky was swimming in offers, and he found his next project in a cinematic version of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel ''Dune.'' (Jodorowsky hadn't read the book, but a friend had told him it was great.) With the backing of a young French oil heir named Michel Seydoux, Jodorowsky worked feverishly for two years, creating storyboards with a team of artists and assembling a cast that included David Carradine, Mick Jagger, Orson Welles and Salvador Dalí (who insisted on a salary of $100,000 per minute of screen time). Pink Floyd and the French prog-rock band Magma signed on to provide scores for two of the warring planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After burning through more than $2 million of Seydoux's money and never shooting a frame, Jodorowsky could not find additional backing. While he believed his ''Dune'' would mark the arrival of an ''artistical, cinematographical god,'' Hollywood saw a money pit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is his 'Dune' a failure?'' Frank Pavich, the director of the new film, says. ''I don't think it is. Everything is there, everything is in the storyboard book Jodo made -- the artwork, every scene, every bit of dialogue, every camera move, everything. Was his goal to make a film, or was his goal to change the world? Well, if his goal was to change the world, then mission accomplished.'' Pavich makes that case in the final section of his documentary, comparing the French comic-book artist Moebius's sketches for ''Dune'' with uncannily similar clips from ''Star Wars,'' ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''The Terminator.'' Did George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron take ideas from the storyboards of ''Dune,'' copies of which, we're told in the documentary, were left with every major studio? ''Jodorowsky's Dune'' argues that there was at least a subconscious influence. Of no dispute, though, is that the movie sired Ridley Scott's ''Alien,'' which was co-written by Dan O'Bannon, the special effects creator of ''Dune,'' and given its Oscar-winning visual effects by another ''Dune'' artist, the Swiss surrealist H. R. Giger. Moebius and the British painter Chris Foss, who dreamed up the interstellar spaceships of ''Dune,'' were consultants on that film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''Jodorowsky's Dune,'' Jodorowsky tells Pavich: ''I have the ambition to live 300 years. I will not live 300 years. Maybe I will live one year more. But I have the ambition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jodorowsky and I talked in his study, he returned to the theme of mortality. ''Accepting death is a massive problem for everybody,'' he said. ''I still fear dying, the physical suffering, but spiritually not anymore. I already accepted it. I had a son who died. That's where the fall of my ego started. That's when I had the terrible encounter with reality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jodorowsky's third son, Teo, had a memorable part in ''Santa Sangre'' as a mambo-dancing bandit, a role that, according to Jodorowsky's youngest son, Adan, was not a far stretch from reality. Teo died in 1995, six years after the premiere of that film, at the age of 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Teo wasn't a drug addict, it was an accident,'' Adan told me. ''My father doesn't like to say that he overdosed, but it is reality. [Teo] used to hate people who take drugs, but one night some stupid friend give him something to sniff. He went to the gym, and it was like that. He was a clever boy, and he died in a stupid way. My father changed a lot. He started to do art to heal people. My brother died to heal our family. I see it this way. We would have never been like this today without his death. It's strange to say, but it's true.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Teo's death, Jodorowsky developed his own form of tarot-derived therapy, psychomagic. The method has earned a wide following in Europe and South America, and he still delivers regular lectures on his theories, which emphasize the psychological wounds that fester within families and the ability of symbolic, often absurd, theatrical displays to heal them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've cured many people,'' he told me. ''I've managed to get people who couldn't have children to have children. I've cured stutterers. Oedipal complexes. And to see all of those things, that enriches your spirit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adan, who wrote the score to ''The Dance of Reality,'' told me about growing up as a ''child of psychomagic.'' His mother, Valerie, Jodorowsky's first wife, used to weep while playing her piano. ''I asked her, 'Why are you crying?' '' Adan recalled, ''and she said, 'It doesn't matter, don't worry.' And I realized that her father left her when she was 3, and he was playing music, so every time when she was playing music, she was in contact with him. So when she left the house, I said, 'I have to do something, I want to be a pianist [too], but I feel bad.' So I buried the piano in a big hole and put a cherry tree on top of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In making ''The Dance of Reality,'' Jodorowsky set out to perform a considerably more elaborate psychomagical treatment. ''This is not a film,'' he announced to his crew. ''This is the healing of my soul.'' For parts of the film, Jodorowsky's parents are more or less as he remembers them. His mother, Sara, is cold and rejects the young Alejandro after he cuts off his golden locks. His father, Jaime, is almost psychopathically stern. But Jodorowsky reimagines them. Sara dreamed of a life in the opera, so Jodorowsky cast a Chilean soprano, Pamela Flores, to sing all of her character's lines. Jaime (played by the oldest of the director's five children, Brontis) was a committed Communist who dreamed of killing Chile's right-wing dictator, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. In the film, Jaime is sent on a winding odyssey to consummate this fantasy, only to find himself reborn, like El Topo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My father was inhuman, I give humanity,'' Jodorowsky told me. ''To my mother I give dignity. Everything I gave to the characters of my genealogical tree, I give to myself. And then you have a past where all the characters are realized.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'The Dance of Reality'' might never have been realized had Frank Pavich not approached Jodorowsky back in 2010, with an idea to retell the almost-making of ''Dune.'' When the two met for the first time in Paris, Jodorowsky was intrigued, but he told Pavich that the rights to the concept art and storyboards belonged to the producer of ''Dune,'' Michel Seydoux. The two men hadn't spoken since the crackup of the movie 35 years before. ''It was not a crisis, but it was very strong for us,'' Seydoux told me. Pavich didn't know what kind of reception to expect when he went to Seydoux's office, but he found the place lined with ''Dune'' images and Seydoux to be an enthusiastic supporter of the project (eventually he became a producer).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So then I went back to Jodo to fill him in,'' Pavich said. ''Now, you could tell that Jodo was nervous: 'What'd he say?' I said: 'He loves you, he misses you. There are posters everywhere. He could not help thinking about you every single day for the last 30 years.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pavich persuaded Jodorowsky and Seydoux to reunite, and after filming of the documentary wrapped, they quickly got back to business. Over a lunch in February 2011, Jodorowsky proposed that Seydoux give him a million dollars to make his own film. Seydoux immediately agreed. The next year, Jodorowsky was filming in Tocopilla, the town he left as a boy and to which he had never returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a necessity to him to do it,'' Seydoux told me last year. ''It was something in his heart, so I said, yes, without any information, any script, any paper, nothing. . . . To help him to repair, to give him another chance -- it's important in life. Even if you are 84, you must have a second chance.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poignant moment occurs near the end of the first episode of ''Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,'' a rollicking 13-part tour of the universe to be broadcast on Fox starting on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting on a rock by the Pacific, Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of the show and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, pulls out an old desk calendar that had belonged to Carl Sagan, the Cornell astronomer and author. On a date in 1975 he finds his own name. The most famous astronomer in the land had invited young Neil, then a high school student in the Bronx with a passion for astronomy, to spend a day in Ithaca.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sagan kindly offered to put him up for the night if his bus didn't come. As Dr. Tyson told the story, he already knew he wanted to be an astronomer, but that day, he said, ''I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story serves as a fitting handoff between the cosmic generations. The young student could hardly have guessed that he would grow up not only to be like Dr. Sagan but in some sense to be him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Dr. Sagan, of course, who invited us onto an imaginary spaceship to tour time, space and the human intellectual experience on the original ''Cosmos,'' which aired on PBS in 1980 and was arguably the most successful popularization of science since Albert Einstein roamed Princeton without his socks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012 the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> designated the book version of the show as one of 88 books that shaped America (among the others were ''Moby-Dick'' and ''The Joy of Cooking''). In a foreword to a new edition of that book, Dr. Tyson writes that the show revealed ''a hidden hunger in us all to learn about our place in the universe and embrace why that matters intellectually, culturally and emotionally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as he says in the opening of the new show, ''It's time to get moving again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, a lot has happened since Dr. Sagan set off on his imaginary spaceship. Robots are exploring Mars, though nobody has been back to the moon. The space shuttle was launched and retired. The expansion of the universe has been found to be accelerating and the temperature of the earth has been found to be warming. We've sequenced the genomes of humans and Neanderthals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to get moving, indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new ''Cosmos'' might be called the Large Hadron Collider of pop science: expensive, splashy and ambitious. After a series of special showings this week, including one at the White House, it will be shown in 170 countries and 45 languages, on Fox and on the National Geographic Channel -- the largest global opening ever for a television series, according to Ann Druyan, Dr. Sagan's widow and his collaborator on the original ''Cosmos,'' who is an executive producer and a writer and director of the new series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not going to pretend to be neutral here. I hope it succeeds and that everyone watches it, not just because I have known Ms. Druyan and admired Dr. Tyson for years, but because we all need a unifying dose of curiosity and wonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'' comes at a critical moment for a society that is increasingly fragmented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are going to decide big issues, like eating genetically modified food, fracking for natural gas, responding to the prospect of drastic climate change, exploring space or engaging in ambitious science research, we are going to have to start from some common experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the longtime senator from New York, once said, everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts. So where are we going to get them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In science, as in other areas of our culture, there is no dearth of voices, but are we paying attention? In the new New Age, it's all about which cable channels you watch or whom you follow on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could use a national conversation that is not about scandal or sports. If everybody watches the new ''Cosmos,'' we can talk about it the way we once argued about ''The Sopranos'' every Monday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And perhaps that will happen. The early reviews of the series are glowing, and an adoring profile of Dr. Tyson recently appeared in The New Yorker. And we are not talking about tweedy PBS here; the show will be on Fox, home of ''24'' and ''American Idol.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to imagine a better man to reboot the cosmos than Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Dr. Sagan's kindness, the young Mr. Tyson did not attend Cornell but went to Harvard and on to the University of Texas and to Columbia, emerging with a Ph.D. in astrophysics. Since 1996 he has been director of the Hayden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There he has thrived as the public face of astronomy in the most diverse and brassiest city in the country, well known to late-night television viewers as gregarious about the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few men can get away with wearing a vest with a giant sunburst on it, but Dr. Tyson is one, a big man with a big personality who seems extremely comfortable in his own skin. He's happy to be thought of as a nerd with street cred. He shines best in impromptu settings like talk shows or needling cosmologists at the annual Asimov debates at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, about nothingness or alternate universes. As the cosmic Everyman in ''Cosmos,'' he proves a convincing and companionable sidekick and tour guide, adding a little shtick and a wink to let the audience in on the fun. Watch him slip on a pair of sunglasses as we approach the moment of the Big Bang, or cover his ears as he reminds us of a certain asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Tyson is deadly serious about science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first episode, ''Standing Up in the Universe,'' we roam the streets of Rome as he recounts the story of Giordano Bruno, the philosopher who was burned at the stake in 1600 for professing the existence of an infinite number of worlds beyond our own. That was at the dawn of the scientific age, only a decade before Galileo looked through a telescope and saw that Bruno was right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the first episode consists of a tour of the solar system and then outward as Dr. Tyson fills out what he calls our long address:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgo supercluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observable universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we get to hop along a cosmic calendar in which the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe has been compressed to 365 days and it's now midnight on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this scale, Dr. Tyson reports, the sun was born on Aug. 31, and the dinosaurs died yesterday morning in that asteroid blast. Everybody you ever heard of, all the kings and queens and prophets, lived in the last 14 seconds of this cosmic year. ''Jesus was born five seconds ago,'' he goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the last second we began to do science,'' he concludes. ''It allowed us to discover where and when we are in the cosmos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is going to be fun.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This occasional column will explore topics covered in Science Times 25 years ago to see what has changed -- and what has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take away gravity, and a lot of physics becomes simpler. Crystals, for example, grow larger and more perfectly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists who study protein shapes -- critical in designing new drugs and pesticides, for example -- that is the attraction of outer space. In orbital experiments, protein molecules (which include hormones, enzymes and antibodies) form into crystals unimpeded by the convection currents that gravity generates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Science Times on March 14, 1989, described an early set of such experiments being conducted on the space shuttle Discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a shuttle mission half a year earlier, the same apparatus had produced a significant success -- the largest crystal at that time for gamma interferon, a protein that stimulates the body's immune system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Space Shuttle STS-29 Discovery post-flight press conference in 1989. Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the crystal returned to the ground, scientists shined X-rays on it, calculating the shape based on the scattering pattern. In general, the larger and better the crystal, the clearer the scattering pattern and greater the accuracy in determining the positions of the atoms in the protein. Protein crystal experiments were conducted on more than 35 space shuttle flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25 YEARS LATER Today, human spaceflight has a very different profile. The shuttle program ended in 2011, and the surviving shuttles are in museums. Science is now done aboard the International Space Station, which is partly served by commercial rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the protein crystal experiments go on. ''We've learned a lot,'' Lawrence J. DeLucas of the University of Alabama, Birmingham, one of the scientists involved, said in an interview last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited crystals of insulin grown on several shuttle flights, which turned out much bigger than earth-grown ones and provided a much clearer picture of the structure of different versions of insulin. ''That's one resounding example,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others are doubtful that the improvements, sporadic and inconsistent, were worth the time and cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The protein crystals on the 1989 Discovery flight turned out to be almost a total flop. In a scientific paper published two years later, Dr. DeLucas and his colleagues reported: ''Unfortunately, showers of small crystals were produced in every chamber flown for all 15 of these proteins. It is not clear what caused this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. DeLucas was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1990, and two years later he conducted protein crystal growth experiments during a two-week shuttle flight, the longest up to that point. The idea was to conduct each experiment more than once, adjusting the parameters based on what he observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even then, only five or six proteins formed crystals large enough to be useful. ''The rest, the crystals were so small, you couldn't really figure out what to do,'' Dr. DeLucas said. ''I realized more than ever then how long it takes for these crystals to grow to their full size and why a space station would really come in handy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he is a principal investigator on a $6 million project that is to fly aboard the International Space Station. The experiment will include 100 proteins with poor results on earth so far. The same crystal-growing experiment will be conducted on the ground at the same time under the same conditions (plus gravity).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four and a half months, the space crystals will return to earth. The analysis will then be conducted double-blind, meaning that the scientists analyzing the crystals will not know which ones were grown on earth and which in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 100 proteins are set to travel to the space station in March aboard a rocket run by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a private company, and return to earth in August. The analysis will then take a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end, Dr. DeLucas said scientists will have a good idea of how useful zero-G is for this type of research. ''What I hope is,'' he said, ''once and for all, we can say, 'Look, if you fly a protein, here's the percent chance that it's going to get improvement.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snow has been so scant in Idaho this winter that bicycles started showing up in shop windows in the middle of January, and cyclists began booking ski huts during a season when it's usually backcountry skiers who are seeking accommodations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What may be bad news for skiers has turned out to be an irresistible opportunity for those who love to ride on mountain bikes with four- and five-inch-wide tires, which are designed to float over snow and sand and still provide substantial cushion for rough single track (even without the suspension common to many bikes with skinnier tires).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where trails are too soft for regular mountain bikes, or too sparse to protect skiers from subsurface obstacles, fat bikes are filling a gap. Riders do well on mixed terrain, including on trails where the snow is too thin for skiing and on south-facing pitches where dirt is exposed during a low-snow winter. ''It's opening a new way to be outdoors,'' Chris Estrem, a Ketchum physical therapist, backcountry skier and world bicycle traveler, said. ''It's made me a better mountain biker. I want to ride it all the time. I love it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tory Canfield, who started an organization called the Fat Bike Advocacy Group, said: ''For me, fat biking on snow creates a sense of ethereal floatiness that conjures up the sensation of powder skiing. As soon as your tire rolls forward, your mouth turns up into a big, fat grin. It is nothing short of fun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather that has made for optimum fat-tire biking may be around for a while, Charles Luce, a Boise-based research hydrologist for the <span class="companylink">United States Forest Service</span>, told me. ''Precipitation has been declining in the region, and the probability of severe droughts has been increasing over the last 60 years,'' said Mr. Luce, who co-wrote a paper on the subject that was published last December in Science magazine. ''One of the key physical drivers for future precipitation, westerly wind, is also expected to decline on average in the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a longtime mountain biker who finds peace in remote trail riding, I decided to experience the winter ''fat bike'' phenomenon for myself and took a road trip from Boise to test bikes in some of the state's mountain haunts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been cold in Boise, which is 2,700 feet above sea level, but that hasn't stopped riders of fat bikes, especially when it comes to fat-bike trials, including an event organized by Fat Bike Boise in early December (a celebration of Global Fat- Bike Day) on a thin layer of early snow preserved by the cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be said that Boise on any bicycle is a compelling starting point for an adventure. Hotels and restaurants are a brief ride from the airport, and trailheads are a short distance from downtown. In Idaho riders learn to roll through stop signs, maintaining guiltless momentum on the way to places like Zoo Boise to see snow leopards because a 1982 rule dubbed the ''Idaho Stop Law'' permits cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first higher elevation stop on my biking quest was at 3,900 feet in Salmon, an outpost for the Continental Divide Trail, at the confluence of the Lemhi and Salmon rivers. Roads there wind through crinkled mountains that begin near places like the phenomenal lava fields of Craters of the Moon and rise to the north above the Snake River Plain that is bent like a fishhook through the southern part of the state -- a dramatic landscape by any route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salmon is a hunting and recreation gateway on the edge of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, a town steeped in Western lore and known as the birthplace of Sacagawea. My trip began at the Hub, a new bike and ski shop a block off Main Street that also serves pizza and beer. There I met the owner, Max Lohmeyer, a Fruita, Colo., native and lifelong mountain biker, who would take me for an evening ride on Discovery Hill. After exiting Mr. Lohmeyer's van at the trailhead, we crunched on our bikes over thin patches of snow turned ice luge in some sections. In the dark, chips of snow that shot from the front tire glowed like welding sparks as they floated through the bright beam of my bike light. Traction on marginally snow-covered trails varied with pitch and aspect. Navigating surfaces and slopes was more fun than it may sound, which I attribute to the novelty of riding a super-fat mountain bike tire under the shine of a full moon. At times during our ride, some 13 miles through mountain desert country with the Salmon photographer David Lingle, we could see the lights of town below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back at the trailhead another rider left a note on Mr. Lingle's car, a calendar photo of two emperor penguins standing together in the grass. One bird, craning its neck, had a scribbled dialogue bubble above it that read, ''Just call me Master of the Moonlight! Bahahaha.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, at dinner at the Junkyard Bistro in Salmon, where the special was an Idaho burrito with mashed potatoes and bacon, the conversation was, inevitably, about fat bikes. ''I've never seen a trend come on so fast,'' Mr. Lohmeyer said. (So much so that the first-ever U.S. National Fat Bike Championship will be held March 8 in Cable, Wis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bed after enjoying the frontier night life, which included watching outdoor hockey, my mind continued to slip and slide -- I was hooked on riding in the snow and excited to try it in the daytime too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get to my next destination I drove through the wide valleys of the Lost River and Pahsimeroi mountain ranges to the Teton Valley, which has a large contingent of snow-sports people in the towns of Victor and Driggs. Snow biking is managed in conjunction with Nordic skiing at the base area of the Grand Targhee Resort at 8,000 feet in Alta, Wyo., and just over the border from Driggs. Groomed trails wind through the forest nestled in the backdrop of the Grand Tetons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Grand Targhee, I was unable to resist the temptation to jump into a fat-bike race on a custom Trek Farley that I tested from Fitzgerald's Bicycles in Victor. (It's the first year that Trek, based in Wisconsin, has produced a fat bike; the Surly Pugsley from Minnesota is known as the first mass-produced mountain bike with extremely high volume tires.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fat biking is exploding,'' said Andy Williams, who organizes special events at the resort and is developing a single-track grooming mechanism to tow behind a snowmobile to further expand snow biking. ''It's really a great way to get out and enjoy winter,'' he added, explaining that other groups, including Nordic skiers, are beginning to wrap their heads around the new use of trails. ''It's not a bad thing, just different,'' he said. ''Fat bikers and skate skiers almost go the same speed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nine-mile, 1,500-foot ride up to Tornak, a Sun Valley Trekking hut at 8,500 feet in the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum (and 33 miles north of Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey), was intended to be the last leg of my fat-bike journey, but it looked doomed after it snowed nearly eight inches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most of my group at Sun Valley Trekking remained committed, and we were admittedly nervous as we made final preparations. I fixed a flat tire, and Joe St. Onge, co-owner of Sun Valley Trekking and a professional ski guide, checked our avalanche transceivers and gave us a safety briefing -- we would cross known avalanche paths on our way to Tornak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We began to ride and pushed our bikes through loose snow perfect for backcountry powder skiing if only the base were better. Pedaling when possible, I remembered advice I had received from Erwin Reitsma, a fellow racer at Grand Targhee: ''Sometimes lower pressure is the difference between pushing and pedaling.'' I let air out of my tires until the pressure was as low as three pounds per square inch. Soft tires provide better traction on soft snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tornak, situated in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area just below Fox Peak, looks like a longhouse and has ornately painted doors, a panoramic window facing the Boulder Mountains, comfortable bunks and a welcoming dining table, all set on a foundation of logs that were cut from standing dead trees in the woods around the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hearty ration of pesto pasta, Belgian beer and pecan bars made by Joe's wife, Francie, led to a long night of heady conversation, with heat provided by a wood stove and the glow by solar-powered lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a restful sleep and a breakfast of pancakes, hash browns and sausage, we were happy to discover that all our work on the ride up the mountain had helped pack down the trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The track that took us more than five hours to ascend with plenty of pushing had stabilized enough in the night that we would pedal out in less than two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If You Go: BOISE The <span class="companylink">Modern Hotel</span> (themodernhotel.com) is a good base of operations. Rooms start at $101. A restaurant favorite is Àlavita (alavitaboise.com) for fresh pasta. George's Cycles (georgescycles.com) has four locations that sell fat bikes.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A batch of programs related to the heavens and what might or might not be lurking in them are coming in March, and the Science Channel gets things started on Sunday with a week of offerings on the theme ''Are We Alone''? The answer, of course, is, ''We have no idea,'' but in exploring the question the Science programs at least prove one thing: No camera angle is too odd when the subject is extraterrestrials.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for instance, the presentations in ''Close Encounters,'' an embarrassing series being introduced with episodes on Tuesday and Friday. Using hokey re-enactments and a smattering of commentary by supposed experts, it dusts off old U.F.O. sightings -- by a farm family in Kansas in 1971, police officers in Illinois in 2000, and more -- that it says still defy explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All will be familiar to the U.F.O. crowd, and the program adds no new information or credibility to them, especially since the re-enactments have a silly 1930s look regardless of when the sightings occurred. And the ''experts'' -- authors, self-described U.F.O. investigators -- are shot in heavy shadow reminiscent of found-footage horror movies in which someone shines a flashlight on his own face in a dark room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as if the shadow weren't spooky enough, the camera angles for these expert interviews jump around ridiculously, often in midsentence. We're looking the expert in the face for the independent clause, but for the dependent clause we're suddenly staring into his ear. The filmmaking theory seems to be that if you discombobulate viewers with random shifts of the camera perhaps they won't notice that your U.F.O. show contains no hard evidence of U.F.O.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experts are better lighted and more credible in ''NASA's Unexplained Files'' on Sunday night. The only thing missing is the ''unexplained.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program examines weird things NASA and its astronauts have noted over the years: odd lights observed by Leroy Chiao during a 2005 spacewalk; a triangular something-or-other seen from the space shuttle in 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The segments are teased with attention-getting narration and quote fragments: ''I certainly hope it's not a death star. Otherwise we're in serious trouble.'' But most everything turns out to be pretty explainable. No extraterrestrials here; just an assortment of interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heavy shadows are back on Wednesday in a new episode of ''Through the Wormhole With Morgan Freeman,'' and Mr. Freeman is the one shrouded in them, again an effort to add a mysterious ambience to the proceedings. But this always intriguing program, unlike ''Close Encounters,'' features real scientists and scholars and high-concept theories, with the barely visible Mr. Freeman as the guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His subject for ''Are We Alone?'' week is, ''Is God an Alien Concept?'' At issue is whether other beings in the universe are likely to ponder the meaning of life and the possibility of God. That premise leads Mr. Freeman to introduce scholars and researchers who are exploring the nature of self-awareness -- including in elephants -- and the origins of religion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space theme comes in when the program speculates on two possibilities. One is that an advanced civilization Out There will have outgrown God, just as some scholars think humans will as their scientific knowledge grows. The other is that when we ultimately make contact with extraterrestrials we will find that the thing that binds all beings together is their shared need for a concept like God, because some questions are unanswerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing else, ''Are We Alone?'' week sets the stage for the mix of dumb and smart space-related programming coming up. On the dumb side a four-part series called ''The Happenings'' begins on March 20 on the National Geographic Channel with an episode in which two illusionists try to convince an entire town that it is under alien attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smarter side: On March 14 the same channel is presenting ''Live From Space,'' broadcast in part from the International Space Station. And on March 9 comes the heavily promoted ''Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'' on Fox and other outlets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler astronomers still combing their vast data archive announced on Wednesday in a news conference and a pair of journal papers that they had verified the existence of 715 more planets orbiting other stars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the largest single-day haul of exoplanets, as such objects are called, since the first such planet was discovered in 1995, bringing the overall total to about 1,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today we almost doubled the number of planets known to humanity,'' said Jack J. Lissauer of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and Jason Rowe of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span>, in Mountain View, Calif., are lead authors of separate papers to be published in The Astrophysical Journal detailing the findings. They discussed their work in a telephone news conference hosted by NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planets were culled from 3,601 candidates previously found by Kepler, using a new statistical technique known as verification by multiplicity. The method vastly reduces the need for outside telescopic observations to verify suspected planets in batches. It works only for multiple-planet systems, but as Dr. Lissauer and his colleagues pointed out, that includes about 40 percent of the Kepler candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a deluge of small planets that has tipped the cosmic balance from the giant Jupiter-size worlds that were the earliest discovered to smaller, friendlier worlds. ''Small planets from the size of Neptune to Earth make up the majority of the planets in the galaxy,'' said Douglas Hudgins, exoplanet program scientist at NASA headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planets in the new set are divided among 305 stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 95 percent, according to Dr. Rowe, are two to four times the size of Earth, a range conspicuously absent in our solar system. Because we have no local examples, astronomers do not know what planets of this size might be like -- rocky like Earth or gassy like Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the newfound planets orbit in the so-called habitable zones of small stars, where temperatures on a planet like our own would be moderate enough for water and thus the kind of life we know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, who was not involved in the new analysis, said the data reinforced Kepler's major finding: The Milky Way is brimming with small planets that could be friendly to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a boon for any future habitable-zone planet-finding mission,'' Dr. Seager said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler seeks planets by the blink method, looking for the dimming of stars' light caused by planets passing in front of them. While this method can tell the sizes and orbits of planets, it is prone to false positives because of confusion with background binary stars, among other things, and it cannot tell the masses and thus the densities and compositions of the worlds it detects, requiring outside observations with other telescopes to confirm their planethood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind verification by multiplicity, which has been long in development, as Dr. Lissauer explained it, is that the false positives should be randomly distributed around the 160,000 stars that Kepler observes, resulting in the appearance of only a few, if any, multiple systems. The fact that they are instead stuck on 400 or so particular stars suggests that those systems are real. He put the odds that one of these was a mistake at about one part in a thousand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is more to come, the astronomers said. The present results are based on a statistical analysis of only the first two years of Kepler data. There is two more years' worth to go, and several hundred more planets are likely to be verified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kepler is the gift that keeps on giving,'' Dr. Seager said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting on a flat volcanic plain 18,000 feet above sea level, the great Quelccaya ice cap of Peru is the largest piece of ice in the tropics. In recent decades, as scientists have watched it melt at an accelerating pace, it has also become a powerful symbol of global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the idea that the ice cap has retreated over time because of a change in temperature, rather than other possible factors like reduced snowfall, has always been more of a surmise than a proven case. In fact, how to interpret the disappearance of glaciers throughout the tropics has been a scientific controversy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a group of scientists is presenting new findings suggesting that over the centuries, temperature is the main factor controlling the growth and retreat of the largest glacier emerging from the ice cap. If they are right, then Quelccaya's recent melting could indeed be viewed as a symbol of the planetary warming linked to human emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper released on Tuesday by the journal Geology, a group led by Justin S. Stroup and Meredith A. Kelly of <span class="companylink">Dartmouth College</span> in Hanover, N.H., used elaborate techniques to date the waxing and waning over the past 500 years of the glacier, called Qori Kalis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group then compared the glacier's movements to a record of ice accumulation on top of Quelccaya, obtained from long cylinders of ice drilled by the glaciologist Lonnie G. Thompson of Ohio State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new paper suggests that the glacier sometimes grew during periods when the accumulation of ice in the region was relatively low, and conversely, that it retreated during some periods of high ice accumulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kelly and Mr. Stroup conclude that the glacier is sensitive to temperature and that other factors, like the amount of snowfall, are secondary, thus supporting a view long held by Dr. Thompson that the glacier can essentially be viewed as a huge thermometer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big driver is temperature,'' said Dr. Thompson, who was not involved in the new paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming it holds up, that is a sobering finding, considering how fast the Qori Kalis glacier is now retreating. Dr. Thompson documented last year that a part of the glacier that had apparently taken 1,600 years to grow had melted in a mere 25 years. He interpreted that as a sign that human emissions and the resultant warming have thrown the natural world far out of kilter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qori Kalis is hardly an outlier, though: land ice is melting virtually everywhere on the planet. That has been occurring since a 500-year period called the Little Ice Age that ended in about 1850, but the pace seems to have accelerated substantially in recent decades as human emissions have begun to overwhelm the natural cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the middle and high latitudes, from Switzerland to Alaska, a half-century of careful glaciology has established that temperature is the main factor controlling the growth and recession of glaciers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the picture has been murkier in the tropics. There, too, glaciers are retreating, but scientists have had more trouble sorting out exactly why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That glaciers should exist at all in the warmest part of the earth is perhaps strange; they do so only in high, cold mountain regions. The tropical glaciers receive intense sunlight virtually year-round. Ice atop these glaciers can sometimes vaporize without even passing through a stage as liquid water. Over short periods, at least, the tropical glaciers appear to be sensitive to changes in clouds and many other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One group of scientists is coming to the conclusion that even in these conditions, temperature is nonetheless the main factor controlling the ebb and flow of tropical glaciers over centuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a second group believes that in some circumstances, at least, a tropical glacier's long-term fate may reflect other factors. In particular, these scientists believe big changes in precipitation can sometimes have more of a role than temperature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews and emails, scientists from both groups praised the new paper for its reconstruction of the Qori Kalis glacier's movements, a feat that required a decade of intensive labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A core finding is that the Peruvian glacier was expanding during the Little Ice Age. That adds to a growing body of research suggesting that the cooling during that mysterious event was global in scope, which may in turn help scientists determine the causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a great study,'' said Aaron E. Putnam of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>, who has done extensive work on glaciers in New Zealand. ''They do something that I haven't seen done in such an elegant way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some scientists were critical of the paper's broader assertion about temperature as the controlling factor for the glacier. ''I actually believe that finding is probably accurate, but I don't see that they make a compelling case for that with this study,'' said Douglas R. Hardy of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who worked extensively on Quelccaya, including documenting a recent, sharp increase of air temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hardy and several of the other critics noted that the Kelly paper's temperature conclusion depended strongly on a record of ice accumulation over centuries that Dr. Thompson had compiled by drilling into Quelccaya. The ice has been compressed over time, so the evidence requires considerable interpretation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the scientists involved in the debate over tropical glaciers believe that global warming is a problem and that human emissions pose a long-term threat to the planet. But the unresolved controversy has served as fodder for skeptics of global warming, who say the scientists do not really know what is going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest scientific battle has been fought not over Quelccaya but over Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. There, too, Dr. Thompson has asserted that the glaciers atop the mountain -- the ''snows of Kilimanjaro,'' in Ernest Hemingway's phrase -- are disappearing because of planetary warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Hardy and other scientists, like Georg Kaser of the <span class="companylink">University of Innsbruck</span> in Austria, have argued that it is actually a series of other factors, primarily a reduction in precipitation, that is starving the Kilimanjaro glaciers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That group says the precipitation decline could be, at least in part, a secondary effect of global warming, caused by rising temperatures in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kelly is now looking for evidence that may shed light on the Kilimanjaro debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her method involves dating ridges of rock and debris, known as moraines, that glaciers leave at their far edges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Kilimanjaro does not have the right kind of rock, but she has begun a study of glacial moraines in the Rwenzori Mountains, 500 miles away in Uganda, that could eventually show whether glaciers in Africa tend to behave in the same way as the one in Peru.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANGALORE, India -- While India's recent launch of a spacecraft to Mars was a remarkable feat in its own right, it is the $75 million mission's thrifty approach to time, money and materials that is getting attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just days after the launch of India's Mangalyaan satellite, NASA sent off its own Mars mission, five years in the making, named Maven. Its cost: $671 million. The budget of India's Mars mission, by contrast, was just three-quarters of the $100 million that Hollywood spent on last year's space-based hit, ''Gravity.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mission is a triumph of low-cost Indian engineering,'' said Roddam Narasimha, an aerospace scientist and a professor at Bangalore's Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By excelling in getting so much out of so little, we are establishing ourselves as the most cost-effective center globewide for a variety of advanced technologies,'' said Mr. Narasimha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's 3,000-pound Mars satellite carries five instruments that will measure methane gas, a marker of life on the planet. Maven (for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution), weighs nearly twice as much but carries eight heavy-duty instruments that will investigate what went wrong in the Martian climate, which could have once supported life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ours is a contrasting, inexpensive and innovative approach to the very complex mission,'' said K. Radhakrishnan, the chairman of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span>, or ISRO, in an interview at the space agency's heavily guarded Bangalore headquarters. ''Yet it is a technically well-conceived and designed mission,'' he said. Wealthier countries may have little incentive to pursue technological advances on the cheap, but not a populous, resource-starved country. So jugaad, or building things creatively and inexpensively, has become a national strength. India built the world's cheapest car ($2,500), the world's cheapest tablet ($49), and even quirkier creations like flour mills powered by scooters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If necessity is the mother of invention, constraint is the mother of frugal innovation,'' said Terri Bresenham, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">GE Healthcare</span>, South Asia, who is based in Bangalore. <span class="companylink">GE Healthcare</span> has the largest research and development operations in India and has produced low-cost innovations in infant health, cancer detection and heart disease treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In India, even a priority sector like space research gets a meager 0.34 percent of the country's total annual outlay. Its $1 billion space budget is only 5.5 percent of NASA's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISRO has learned to make cost-effectiveness a daily mantra. Its inexpensive but reliable launch capabilities have become popular for the launches of small French, German and British satellites. Although the space agency had to build ground systems from scratch, its Chandrayaan moon mission in 2008 cost one-tenth what other nations' moon shots cost, said Mylswamy Annadurai, mission director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious way ISRO does it is low-cost engineering talent, the same reason so many software firms use Indian engineers. India's abundant supply of young technical talent helped rein in personnel costs to less than 15 percent of the budget. ''Rocket scientists in India cost very little,'' said Ajey Lele, a researcher at a New Delhi think tank, the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, and author of ''Mission Mars: India's Quest for the Red Planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average age of India's 2,500-person Mars team is 27. ''At 50, I am the oldest member of my team; the next oldest is 32,'' said Subbiah Arunan, the project's director. Entry-level Indian space engineers make about $1,000 a month, less than a third of what their Western counterparts make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indians also had a short development schedule that contributed heavily to the mission's low cost, said Andrew Coates, planetary scientist at <span class="companylink">University College London</span> and a leader of the European ExoMars expedition planned for 2018. The engineers had to compress their efforts into 18 months (other countries' space vehicles have taken six years or more to build). It was either launch by November 2013 or wait another 26 months when the geometry of the sun, Mars and Earth would again be perfect for a launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since the time was so short, for the first time in the history of such a project, we scheduled tasks by the hour -- not days, not weeks,'' said Mr. Arunan. Mr. Radhakrishnan added: ''Could we pull it off in less than two years' time? Frankly, I doubted it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest budget did not allow for multiple iterations. So, instead of building many models (a qualification model, a flight model and a flight spare), as is the norm for American and European agencies, scientists built the final flight model right from the start. Expensive ground tests were also limited. ''India's 'late beginner' advantage was that it could learn from earlier mission failures,'' said Mr. Lele.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a question of philosophy, and each country has its own,'' explained Mr. Radhakrishnan. ''The Russians, for example, believe in putting large amounts of time and resources into testing so that the systems are robust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His agency curbed costs by another technique familiar to businesses in India: transforming old technology into new. The launch vehicle was first developed in the late 1970s and was augmented several times to become the solid propulsion system currently used in its latest Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehiclelauncher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The G.S.L.V.'s engine also dates back to the early 1970s, when ISRO engineers used technology transferred from France's Ariane program. The same approach, which the Indian scientists call modularity, extended to building spacecraft and communication systems. ''We sometimes have to trade off an ideal configuration for cost-effectiveness, but the heritage is being improved constantly,'' said Mr. Radhakrishnan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost savings also came from using similar systems across a dozen concurrent projects. Many related technologies could be used in the Mars project; Astrosat, an astronomy mission to be launched in late 2014; the second moon mission, which is two years away; and even Aditya, a solar mission four years out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Systems like the attitude control, which maintains the orientation of the spacecraft; the gyro, a sensor that measures the satellite's deviation from its set path; or the star tracker, a sensor that orients the satellite to distant objects in the celestial sphere, are the same across several ISRO missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building blocks are kept the same so we don't have to tailor-make for each mission,'' said Mr. Annadurai of the moon mission. ''Also, we have a ready backup if a system fails.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teams also did the kind of thing engineers working on missions do around the world. They worked through weekends with no overtime pay, putting in more hours to the dollar. Mr. Arunan slept on the couch in his office through the 18 months, rereading his favorite P. G. Wodehouse novels to relieve stress. "This is the Indian way of working,'' said Mr. Annadurai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its cost-effectiveness, many have argued that India's extraterrestrial excursions are profligate in a country starved of even basic necessities like clean drinking water and toilets. Millions sleep hungry at night, critics have emphasized. They condemn the Mars mission as nothing more than showing off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists have argued that early Indian satellites paved the way for today's advanced disaster management systems and modern telecom infrastructure. In the 1970s, cyclones killed tens of thousands of people. Last year, when Cyclone Phailin struck India's east coast, the casualties were in the single digits. In the 1980s, television broadcasts were available in only four Indian cities, but today they are found countrywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars mission is also having a multiplier effect on Indian industry. Companies like <span class="companylink">Larsen &amp; Toubro</span> and <span class="companylink">Godrej &amp; Boyce</span>, which built vital parts for the satellite, will use this high-tech expertise to compete for global aerospace, military and nuclear contracts worth billions of dollars. Godrej, for example, has begun making engine parts for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have also said that space exploration and the alleviation of poverty need not be mutually exclusive. ''If the Mars mission's $75 million was distributed equally to every Indian, they would be able to buy a cup of roadside chai once every three years,'' said Mr. Narasimha, the aerospace scientist, referring to the tea that many Indians drink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My guess is that even the poorest Indians will happily forgo their chai to be able to see their country send a rocket all the way to Mars.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cloud is as massive as three Earths -- no match for the black hole, which has the mass of four million suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a rare opportunity to witness spoon-feeding of a black hole,'' said Avi Loeb, a theoretical astrophysicist at Harvard. ''Will the gas reach the black hole, and if so, how quickly? Will the black hole throw up or spit the gas out in the form of an outflow or a jet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The experience is as exciting for astronomers,'' he went on, ''as it is for parents taking the first photos of their infant eating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the black hole devours a sizable chunk of the cloud, a digestive process that could take many months to years, fireworks could ensue. Heated to billions of degrees as it spirals inward, the doomed gas cloud may emit a last gasp of radiation, ranging from radio waves to X-rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if the encounter proves a dud, it may still provide insight about the feeding habits of big black holes, which are believed to reside at the center of nearly every large galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will learn something no matter what happens,'' said Andrea Ghez, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has monitored the galactic center since 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The action is likely to unfold in two acts, said Stefan Gillessen of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany. His team discovered the gas cloud, G2, in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stage could come just weeks after the cloud, already stretched into a spaghetti-like strand by the black hole's gravity, makes its closest approach to Sagittarius A*. Models suggest that will occur around March 31, give or take three weeks, Dr. Gillessen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At closest approach, the cloud's distance from the black hole will still be about 200 times Earth's distance from the sun. Nonetheless, the passage might be near enough for G2 to plow into the outer edge of the swirling disk of matter believed to surround and feed the black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shock wave generated by that encounter may create X-rays and radio waves that could be detected by telescopes. If the cloud contains a star at its center, as some astronomers have proposed, it may produce a stronger shock and generate more light, said Sera Markoff of the University of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The encounter could have another effect: Disruptions in the cloud might alter the direction in which radio waves vibrate as they travel through. Simultaneous observations with telescopes tuned to different radio wavelengths have a chance of discerning the waves' twists, giving astronomers new details about the cloud's properties, said Geoffrey Bower, a radio astronomer with Asiaa, the Taiwanese astronomy organization, in Hilo, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of the potential fireworks are at least a year away, perhaps decades. That is how long it may take material torn from G2 to spiral inward through the black hole's feeding disk, coming 100 times closer to the hole than it is now. At that location, gas becomes hot enough to radiate at high intensity before it is swallowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, astronomers think that if the gas cloud is to be swallowed, it will have to lose much of its angular momentum, or orbital rotation, around the black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although theorists have proposed that friction in the disk reduces the material's rotation, ''the simulations on our computers are not capable enough to track the descent,'' Dr. Gillessen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the gas takes a relatively short time to spiral inward, it would indicate that the black hole's disk is viscous, like honey, and that it easily robs the gas of its rotational speed. A much longer time -- decades, for example -- would indicate that the disk has a lower viscosity, like water, allowing the gas to circle many times before it goes down the drain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Loeb, of Harvard, said the radiation produced by the dregs of G2 could explain past observations that Sagittarius A* is both dim and a poor eater -- able to consume only one ten-thousandth of the food supply available to it at large distances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other clouds in the black hole's vicinity may provide future fodder for Sagittarius A*. But even if G2 is its last meal for the foreseeable future, there is more excitement to come. Next year, the Event Horizon Telescope, an array of radio telescopes that has already examined Sagittarius A*, will gain enough acuity to discern the light that just misses being dragged into Sagittarius A* but is bent by the black hole's gravity into a halo that frames it. (That is so acute that the array could make out an orange on the surface of the moon, said the project's leader, Sheperd Doeleman, an astronomer at the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory and the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deviations from the predicted shape of the halo would indicate that Einstein's theory of gravity needs revision. And in 2018, a bright star called S0-2 will further test the theory by coming considerably closer to Sagittarius A* than the gas cloud does at its closest approach. The star's orbit and light will reveal whether Einstein's equations correctly describe gravity near a supermassive black hole.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over 45 years ago, midway on their journey to the Moon, the astronauts of Apollo 8 looked back at the Earth and became the first humans in history to see our world wholly in the round, whirling through the void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth was so shrunken by distance, the astronaut Jim Lovell noted, that he could cover it with an outstretched thumb. Looking at the small disk of white, brown and royal blue far below, he grew pensive. ''What I keep imagining is, if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about Earth at this altitude, whether I'd think it would be inhabited or not,'' Mr. Lovell mused. He saw no obvious signs of life or civilization, and wondered whether an outsider would even recognize the blue as ocean and the brown as land.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lunar orbit on Christmas Eve, the Apollo 8 crew read the creation story from Genesis, and snapped pictures of the Earth rising like a fragile jewel above the Moon's monochrome craters. The photographs awakened something long slumbering within all who saw them, a greater sense of worth for our world and all its wonders. Among those who sent Apollo on its lunar voyage, it had become fashionable to believe our species and our planet were unremarkable footnotes in an indifferent and pointless universe. Yet glimpsed from a spacecraft orbiting the Moon, alive and alone in the endless dark, the Earth was revealed without question as the most precious and significant object in the solar system, having birthed beings to behold such an expansive view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew of Apollo 8 had set out to visit the Moon but rediscovered the Earth and some fraction of our faded glory. Today, we are poised for another epochal discovery, one that could once again transform our perceptions of our place in creation. We are on the verge of taking world-changing pictures -- not of our Earth, but of other planets that might be like it, far beyond our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These planets would first appear just as sparkling glints in images from a telescope, but we could still study them for signs of habitability and life. Even reduced to a pointlike dot, a planet's surface can be crudely mapped by fluctuations in its brightness, as light-absorbing oceans or highly reflective continents periodically spin into view. By measuring how light interacts with molecules in a planet's atmosphere, a world can be surveyed for ''biosignature'' gases such as oxygen and methane, allowing scientists to sniff out the breath of life at interstellar distances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past 20 years, astronomers have been conducting a galactic planetary census of the Milky Way. So far they have found more than a thousand planets, and evidence for hundreds of billions more. Because even the biggest, brightest planets are still much smaller and fainter than their stars, most of these newly discovered worlds have revealed themselves not in photographs, but via indirect ways involving the wobbling or dimming of their parent stars. Most of the planets now known seem to be quite unlike the Earth. But the more carefully they look, the more astronomers are finding many smaller, more Earth-like ''Goldilocks'' worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Goldilocks world is not too big, causing it to be smothered beneath thick layers of gas. It is not too small, so that its atmosphere drifts away. It is neither scorchingly close nor frigidly far from its star, which, like our Sun, is sedately middle-aged and midsized. Instead, a Goldilocks world resides where temperatures could be just right for liquid water, the cornerstone of life. Statistics suggest that such a planet exists within a dozen light-years of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will any of the Goldilocks worlds have oceans and continents, seasons and moonlight? Will they have plants and animals, cities and machines? Will mirror Earths prove common as dirt, or could our world and each of our lives upon it turn out to be more precious than most have dared to dream? Unless we strive to actually see those promising planets, we will have scant hope of answering these questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges to photographing a mirror Earth are daunting, but not insurmountable. A small rocky planet is a dim mote of dust lost in the glare from a thermonuclear fireball we call a star. For every photon of planetary light that goes into making a picture, 10 billion stellar photons must first be filtered out; remarkably, researchers have already devised several ways to do this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that the planet-hunters really need to find the mirror Earths is a big mirror, high above the Earth's blurring atmosphere -- a space telescope large enough to gather the faint light of Goldilocks worlds around a sizable sample of stars. Such a powerful telescope would broadly benefit all of astronomy and cosmology, and its technological development would be invaluable for commercial and defense applications requiring large, lightweight structures deployed in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, as presently conceived, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope falls short of what is needed, and the world's underfunded, overburdened space agencies have neither the mandate nor commitment to build anything else remotely suitable. Worse, the space science community is divided. Some space scientists who do not study planets are fearful that their own research specialties will be overshadowed by the glamorous search for Goldilocks worlds. They would not mourn the stillbirth of any ambitious life-finding telescope, no matter how much such projects may be desired by the taxpaying public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this cynical faction has its way, as the list of Goldilocks worlds around nearby stars grows long in the years to come, those planets shall be silently passed over to remain unexplored. The prospect of shattering or substantiating our cosmic solitude could slip through our fingers. In that future, anyone could point to stars harboring what could be mirror Earths, but each twinkling point of light would only mock us with the sight of what we might have known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must decide which future we want. The time has come to look into our mirrors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Max Tegmark</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 421 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halfway into his new book, ''Our Mathematical Universe,'' the M.I.T. physicist Max Tegmark describes his ''Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde Strategy'': During the day he would do respectable work on mainstream topics in cosmology, but at night he would ''transform into the evil Mr. Hyde'' and indulge in writing ''wacky'' papers on ''the ultimate nature of reality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This strategy is employed in the book itself, which can be divided into two parts, different as day and night. One, by Dr. Tegmark, is an informative survey of exciting recent developments in astrophysics and quantum theory. The other, by Mr. Tegmark, is a discussion of his controversial idea that reality itself is a mathematical structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first part starts with a list of fundamental questions, such as: Is space infinite? Is the Milky Way expanding? What caused the Big Bang? What are dark matter and dark energy? After lucidly educating us about stars and galaxies, Dr. Tegmark quickly gets to the main points. He tells us of cosmic microwave radiation, ''the faint afterglow'' of the Big Bang, and other discoveries in cosmology in the past 50 years that yielded ''baby pictures of when our universe was 'only' 400,000 years old'' and ''crucial clues to our cosmic origins.'' Tegmark participated in some of these pioneering developments, and he enlivens his story with personal anecdotes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe still elude our understanding. An important step toward unraveling the mystery was the theory of inflation initiated in the 1980s by Alan Guth and others. The ''radical insight'' was that if once upon a time there was ''a tiny uniform blob of a substance whose density was very hard to dilute,'' then it could ''inflate,'' exponentially increasing its size. But if so, how could mass be created from nothing: ''Who paid for the ultimate free lunch?'' Tegmark does an excellent job explaining this and other puzzles in a way accessible to nonspecialists. Packed with clever metaphors, this section illuminates an important area on the cutting edge of modern physics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Tegmark's professed alter ego takes over. He asks a question that philosophers and scientists have debated for centuries: Why is mathematics so effective in describing the world? The answer is not as simple as it might seem. A great body of math has been developed without any reference to physical reality, motivated by problems within the narrative of mathematics itself. Some of these theories subsequently found real-world applications (for example, 60 years after Riemannian geometry was developed, Einstein used it to describe gravity), but most modern math does not currently manifest itself in the world around us. An argument can also be made that mathematical ideas are objective and exist independently from the human mind -- many mathematicians adhere to this view, called mathematical Platonism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Tegmark's take is quite different from -- and in some ways inconsistent with -- Platonism. Math is so effective in describing the world, he says, because physical reality is a mathematical structure. He calls it the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (M.U.H.). What exactly this means is a big question, which is never fully answered. Mr. Tegmark's argument is that all physical properties of an electron, say, can be described mathematically; therefore, to him, an electron is itself a mathematical structure -- as is everything else, including us. ''You're a pattern in space-time,'' Tegmark says, and he is not just speaking metaphorically. Well, it's true that the trajectory of a human is a pattern in space-time, but does it mean that a human is this pattern? What accounts for consciousness, for example? ''I think that consciousness is the way information feels when being processed in certain complex ways,'' Tegmark says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tried to process this information, but didn't feel much. Let's go back to the notion of ''mathematical structure.'' We read in the book that it is a ''set of abstract elements with relations between them,'' like the set of whole numbers with operations of addition and multiplication. However, there is a lot more to math than such mathematical structures. Objects other than sets are necessary, and they have now become widespread. Moreover, there is an effort underway to overhaul the foundations of math in which set theory is no longer central. So mathematical structures constitute but a small island of modern mathematics. Why would someone who believes that math is at the core of reality try to reduce all of reality to just this island? Where would the rest of math then reside? Unfortunately, these questions are not addressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger problem is that M.U.H. appears to contradict Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which states that in any sufficiently sophisticated, consistent mathematical theory there will be true statements that cannot be decided within that theory. Conceding this point, Tegmark replaces Mathematical Universe Hypothesis with Computable Universe Hypothesis: Only ''computable'' mathematical structures should be allowed. But this rules out all structures that contain infinity! In fact, he admits that ''our current standard model (and virtually all historically successful theories) violate the C.U.H.,'' which does not bode well for the whole idea, to say the least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, Mr. Tegmark has no qualms about telling us that there are infinitely many parallel universes out there. Actually, he believes that any mathematical structure spawns its own universe, and that all of these universes exist in parallel and on equal footing (further, he claims that if you accept M.U.H. or C.U.H., you are forced to also accept this proposal). According to him, a simple square, for example, should be viewed as just as legitimate a universe as the world around us. Tegmark's ''Level IV Multiverse'' is therefore much like Borges's Library of Babel, containing all possible books that can be written with a given alphabet. Any question is answered in one of them, but no one knows which one. In what sense is having all these books (or universes) different from nothing at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact we do know that mathematical structures are not created equal. The development of mathematics was never random -- there was always a sense of direction and purpose. Besides, how could one possibly prove or disprove the existence of this mathematical multiverse? Mr. Tegmark claims he can: ''One of the key testable predictions of the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis is that physics research will uncover further mathematical regularities in nature.'' But such regularities can mean anything, so this ''prediction'' is as far from the scientific method as the purported universes are from one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does not stop the author from entertaining various situations involving multiple copies of ''you'' living in those universes, such as: ''When the number of yous increases, you perceive subjective randomness. When the number of yous decreases, you perceive subjective immortality.'' (The real question, however, might be, What is the number of yous who can understand what this means?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing wrong with contemplating speculative ideas, but the problem is that while pretending to stay in the realm of science, the ''Mr. Hyde'' part of the book crosses over to what I must consider science fiction and mysticism. It raises provocative questions that will make you ponder the essence of reality, but readers expecting the discussion to be as coherent and intellectually fulfilling as it is in the scientific sections will be disappointed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new and more lethal strain of avian influenza is surging through China, experts say. Known as H7N9, the strain first emerged last March, and has already infected at least 300 people; about a quarter have died. By contrast, the H5N1 strain that jumped from birds to people in 2003 took five years to reach the 300-case mark. ''H7N9 is blowing right by H5N1,'' said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the <span class="companylink">University of Minnesota</span>. A newer strain, H10N8, has infected two people in China and killed one. Neither strain sickens the birds that carry it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration will create seven regional ''climate hubs'' to help rural communities and farmers adapt to the risks of climate change, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced. In 2012, record drought took a toll on farmers, and the economy lost $50 billion to drought from 2011 to 2013, according to government estimates. The White House hopes the new hubs will also help make the case for broader climate regulations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For women who have had epidural anesthesia, a normal second stage of labor -- in which the mother pushes -- can last as long as 5.6 hours during a first birth, a new study said. For second births, a normal second stage can last 3.3 hours. Those are each more than an hour longer than generally recognized, suggesting that some women are being subjected to unnecessary interventions, such as cesarean sections. The researchers said current guidelines should be revised.</p>

The fish was listed in 1993 because of loss of habitat and predation by nonnative species. At the time, fewer than 1,000 of the fish existed, but thanks to a recovery plan that included habitat restoration, that number now exceeds 150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space: A Wobbly Planet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Kepler telescope has discovered a planet so wobbly that its seasons must fluctuate wildly, The Los Angeles Times reported. About 2,300 light-years away, in the constellation Cygnus, the planet -- Kepler-413b -- spins on an axis that could vary as much as 30 degrees over 11 years. By comparison, Earth's rotational precession is 23.5 degrees over 26,000 years. Astronomers suspect that other planetary bodies have tilted its orbit, or that a star is exerting a gravitational pull.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at <span class="companylink">Brookhaven National Laboratory</span> began pumping liquid helium into 1,740 superconducting magnets last week as they prepared to recreate the primordial soup that emerged after the Big Bang, The Huffington Post reported. Once the magnets chill to absolute zero (or close), they will be used to smash gold ions at near-light speed, creating temperatures of 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit. That should melt the protons and neutrons, mimicking the plasma that existed in the moments after the universe was born. The experiment aims to explain how the universe evolved.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Elizabeth Kolbert joined The New Yorker in 1999, after more than a decade covering New York politics as a reporter and columnist for The New York Times, she began gravitating to environmental issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The magazine has a history in this area,'' she told me in one of two recent conversations. ''They'd published Rachel Carson. It was unoccupied territory at the time.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week Ms. Kolbert, 52, published her second major book on the environment, ''The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History'' (Henry Holt), which asks science-based questions about whether humans might be causing mass extinction. (Her first, ''Field Notes From a Catastrophe,'' was about climate change.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows is an edited and condensed version of our conversations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How does a journalist take on a topic this big -- mass extinction?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I wrote a book almost 10 years ago on climate change, and I was looking for the next project. And my thought was, ''Climate change is a huge story -- there can't be a bigger one.'' As I looked for a new book, what I kept bumping into was the reality that climate change was actually part of an even bigger phenomenon: the many ways humans are changing the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not something we're doing because our species is greedy or evil. It's happening because humans are human. Many of the qualities that made us successful -- we are smart, creative, mobile, cooperative -- can be destructive to the natural world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we use fossil fuels, we are reversing geological history by taking organisms that were buried millions of years ago and pumping their carbon back into the atmosphere at a very fast rate. If I go to Antarctica, an organism I bring on my shoe could be devastating to a life form that has evolved there without any defense against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humans have sped up the rate by which we change the world, while the rate at which evolution adapts is much slower. There's a mismatch between what we can do and what nature can sustain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why do you say this could lead to an extinction event?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not what I say. It's what many respected scientists are writing. If you read the scientific literature, you see frequent allusions to a current mass extinction event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in my book, I take the readers to places where signs of this are visible. We go to the Great Barrier Reef. Coral reefs may well be the first entire ecosystem that fails because of human impacts, mainly acidifying the oceans and changes in the water temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also go to the Amazon, which is being cut down and divided. There you see how fragmenting the landscape impacts what lives in the forest. We go to the Andes, which are warming up very quickly. I go with scientists tracking plants as they seed themselves and grow at higher elevations. We see species that were not at this elevation a decade ago, moving upslope to keep up with change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much do we know about past extinctions, events that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the events we know little about. In the last 500 million years, there have been five major extinction events. The third, about 250 million years ago, was the worst. Approximately 90 percent of species disappeared. The theory on the third and its lessons are very relevant to us now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was caused by a massive volcanic eruption which went on quite a long time and released a lot of carbon dioxide. It caused tremendous global warming and the acidification of the oceans on a very dramatic scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fifth extinction, the one that did in the dinosaurs, was caused by an asteroid. Interestingly, today, you hear knowledgeable scientists say, ''We are the asteroid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did you find writing about extinction depressing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've tried to transcend my own feelings. Yes, it's depressing, but you have to look it in the face. That's true of a lot of topics. People say, ''Don't look at the photographs from Syria; they are too depressing.'' But it's required that we overcome those barriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other side of it was that in writing a book about extinction, I went to some of the most amazing places on Earth. I walked across the Great Barrier Reef at night!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I went snorkeling in the Bay of Naples, where Jason Hall-Spencer was looking at an unusual natural experiment: The water in one specific place is naturally acidified because of volcanic vents that spew out CO2. In a very concentrated area, you can see what the normal Mediterranean looks like: vivid and full of life. But by the vents, you see what the acidified ocean of the future might look like: an underwater moonscape. Very little could live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I had an absolutely great time going into the field. I always came home and said, ''That was incredibly interesting.'' It wasn't like I came home and curled into a little ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You profile Kinohi, a Hawaiian crow in the San Diego zoo. Why him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's one of about 100 of his kind left. Kinohi is being kept there so that his sperm can be collected by a very, very devoted specialist. She spends a lot of time stroking him and trying to get him to ejaculate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending time with them showed me the amazing lengths people are willing to go through to preserve species. That's the other side of the extinction story. With Kinohi, one felt the shadow of his impending death -- he's very old in bird years -- and that of his species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extinction hangs over the whole enterprise. His tissue will be frozen when he dies, and they will take a cell line from him. And they will keep those cells alive. So there you have people being ingenious and devoted, and meanwhile all these things are going on that are having these tragic effects. His story brought together a lot of the strands of our relationships to other species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You posit that if there is a sixth extinction, it won't be cockroaches who inherit the planet, as many New Yorkers predict, but rats. Why rats?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My guess is that the roaches will do fine. This is the conjecture of one of the key characters in the book, Jan Zalasiewicz. He's a British geologist, who has imagined the planet of the future and has wondered who will survive. He thinks rats have gone with people everywhere and done very well in the new places. They eat everything, and they reproduce like crazy. His provocative idea is that one of our human legacies is going to be rats everywhere, including on islands and places where they weren't before, and that they'll change in size, get bigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He jokingly speculates that rats will eventually evolve to make tools, live in caves and sit around in the skin of other mammals -- just like a certain primate we know about.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worldwide honeybee die-off has already been attributed to everything from stress to cellphone radiation. Now, researchers say it may be linked to a rapidly mutating virus that jumped from tobacco plants to soy plants to bees. Writing in the journal mBio, an international team says the animals may be passing around the tobacco ringspot virus in the pollen they pick up while foraging. (Bees mix saliva and nectar with pollen to make ''bee bread'' for larvae to eat.) Mites that feed on the bees may also play a role in transmitting the virus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virus is probably just one explanation for what is collectively known as colony collapse disorder, the researchers said; viruses, pesticides and other environmental factors probably contribute, too.</p>

The problem is that the rock, shaped like a jelly doughnut, didn't appear in a photo of the same spot taken just two weeks earlier. Was it kicked up by a rover tire, or did a meteorite happen to land nearby? Either way, the rock, nicknamed Pinnacle Island, provides an exciting research opportunity. ''Pinnacle Island may have been flipped upside down when a wheel dislodged it,'' NASA said in a statement, ''providing an unusual circumstance for examining the underside of a Martian rock.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some problems, like the brittling of bone, may have been overcome already. Others have been identified -- for example, astronauts have trouble eating and sleeping enough -- and NASA is working to understand and solve them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the health problems that still elude doctors more than 50 years after the first spaceflight. In a finding just five years ago, the eyeballs of at least some astronauts became somewhat squashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest hurdle remains radiation. Without the protective cocoon of Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, astronauts receive substantially higher doses of radiation, heightening the chances that they will die of cancer. How much of a cancer risk later in life is acceptable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Johnson Space Center here, the home base for NASA's human spaceflight program, scientists probably have until the 2030s to dissect these problems before the agency sends astronauts to Mars -- a mission that would take about 2.5 years, or nearly six times the current standard tour of duty on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longest any human has been off Earth is almost 438 days, by Dr. Valery Polyakov on the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995. (Two private organizations, Inspiration Mars and Mars One, have announced plans to launch a manned interplanetary flight sooner and have had no problem attracting people despite the risks, known and unknown.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA recently announced that it would continue operating the space station until at least 2024, in part for additional medical research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials often talk about the ''unknown unknowns'' -- the unforeseen problems that catch them by surprise. The eye issue caught them by surprise, and they are happy it did not happen in the middle of a mission to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, during his six-month stay on the International Space Station, Dr. Michael R. Barratt, a NASA astronaut who is also a physician, noticed he was having some trouble seeing things close up, as did another member of the six-member crew, Dr. Robert B. Thirsk, a Canadian astronaut who is also a doctor. So the two performed eye exams on each other, confirming the vision shift toward farsightedness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also saw hints of swelling in their optic nerves and blemishes on their retinas. On the next cargo ship, NASA sent up a high-resolution camera so that they could take clearer images of their eyes, which confirmed the suspicions. Ultrasound images showed that their eyes had become somewhat squeezed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now checking astronauts' eyesight before, during and after trips to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue turns out not to be new. Many space shuttle astronauts had complained of changes in eyesight, but no one had studied the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is now a recognized occupational hazard of spaceflight,'' Dr. Barratt said. ''We uncovered something that has been right under our noses forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Barratt said the vision shift had no effect on his ability to work in space. The concern, however, is that the farsightedness may be just a symptom of more serious changes in the astronauts' health. ''What are the long-term implications?'' he said. ''That's the $64 million question.''</p>

Kelly, who will spend one year on the space station beginning in spring 2015: twice as long as his stay there in 2010 and 2011 and the longest for an American. A Russian astronaut, Mikhail Kornienko, will also make a yearlong trip to orbit then. Dr. Polyakov and three other Russian astronauts have already had orbital stays longer than that and returned seemingly not much the worse for wear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John B. Charles, chief of the international science office of NASA's human research program, is setting up the medical experiments, designed to figure out whether there are differences between a six-month stay and a 12-month stay. ''Logically, you might say, how can there not be?'' Dr. Charles said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is also possible that the body becomes acclimated to weightlessness after only a few months, and that the changes in vision and bones level off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctors will also compare Scott Kelly's health with that of Mark Kelly, his twin brother. ''I imagine I'll be giving blood and urine samples,'' said Mark Kelly, who is married to Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman. ''My attitude is, I worked at NASA for 16 years and whatever I can do to help, I will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, NASA scientists worried that astronauts were returning to Earth with weaker bones, their density draining away by 1 to 2 percent per month. In space, the body does not need to support its weight, and it responds by dismantling bone tissue much faster than on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA turned to osteoporosis drugs and improved exercises, like having the astronauts run while strapped to a treadmill. The up-and-down pounding set off signals to the body to build new bone, and NASA scientists reported that astronauts then came back with almost as much bone as when they had left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was huge,'' said Scott M. Smith, a NASA nutritionist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because both the formation and destruction occur at accelerated rates, ''we don't know if that bone is as strong as when you left,'' Dr. Smith said. But the scientists now feel that bone loss is not a showstopper for a long-duration mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the eyesight issues, scientists have more questions than answers. They suspect that the adverse effects result largely from the fluid shift, the higher pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid in the skull pushing on the back of the eyeballs, but that has not been proved. And that theory does not explain why it usually affects the right eye more than the left, and men far more than women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Smith has also found that the astronauts who experienced a shift in vision had increased levels of the amino acid homocysteine, often a marker for cardiovascular disease. That may suggest that a zero-gravity environment sets some biochemical process in motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artificial gravity could be generated by spinning the spacecraft like a merry-go-round, alleviating both the bone loss and the fluid shift. But that would also add complexity to a mission and raise the potential for a catastrophic accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the eye issue ''could be something that drives us back to artificial gravity,'' Dr. Barratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of gravity also jumbles the body's neurovestibular system that tells people which way is up. When returning to the pull of gravity, astronauts can become dizzy, something that Mark Kelly took note of as he piloted the space shuttle to a landing. ''If you tilt your head a little left or right,'' he said, ''it feels like you're going end over end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not be as big an issue for a Mars spacecraft that lands autonomously, and in which the astronauts have time to rest before getting out of their seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding radiation, NASA operates under a restriction that astronauts should not have their lifetime cancer risk raised by more than three percentage points, but that is an arbitrary limit. Mark Kelly, for one, said he would be willing to accept twice that if he had a chance to go to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be other complications, though. At <span class="companylink">Brookhaven National Laboratory</span> on Long Island, scientists are bombarding mice with radiation that mimics high-energy cosmic rays that zip through outer space. Those mice take longer to navigate a maze, suggesting that the radiation may be damaging their brains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say it may damage other organs, including the heart, nervous system and digestive system. ''Those could be acute effects,'' said William H. Paloski, the head of NASA's human research program. ''We just don't know. It's one we're looking at.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the body, there is also the mind. The first six months of Scott Kelly's one-year mission are expected to be no different from his first trip to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Gary E. Beven, a NASA psychiatrist, said he was interested in whether anything changed in the next six months. ''We're going to be looking for any significant changes in mood, in sleep, in irritability, in cognition,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For trips beyond Earth orbit, astronauts will be isolated from the rest of humanity. During the Apollo missions, there was a lag time of 1.3 seconds between a command from mission control and an astronaut's hearing it, the time for a radio signal to travel the 240,000 miles from Houston to the moon. At Mars, the lags would stretch minutes, and real-time conversation with someone on Earth would be impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew of a Mars mission -- four or six astronauts in NASA's current thinking -- would have to be more self-reliant to solve any personality conflicts. Dr. Beven envisioned computer systems that could detect subtle changes in facial expressions or tone of voice, perhaps offering some suggestions for defusing tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Russian experiment in 2010 and 2011, six men agreed to be sealed up in a mock spaceship simulating a 17-month Mars mission. Four of the six developed disorders, and the crew became less active as the experiment progressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that's just an example of what could potentially happen during a Mars mission, but with much greater consequence,'' Dr. Beven said. ''Those subtle changes in group cohesion could cause major problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charles said he thought NASA could already send astronauts to Mars and bring them back alive. But given the huge expense of such a mission, he said it was crucial that the astronauts arrived productive and in great health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My goal,'' he said, ''is to see a program that doesn't deliver an astronaut limping to Mars.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years ago, NASA's Opportunity rover bounded to the surface of Mars for what was planned to be a three-month exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity is still going today -- and still making discoveries.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest, scientists said on Thursday at a news conference celebrating an anniversary none had expected 10 years ago, is a small rock that seemingly appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock, whose chemical composition was also unexpected, appears in an image taken Jan. 8. There was no rock in a picture taken of the same spot less than two weeks earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is strange,'' said Steven W. Squyres, the principal investigator for Opportunity, during the NASA news conference. But he added, ''We don't think anything particularly exotic happened here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Squyres said the most likely explanation was that as the rover pirouetted at an uphill location, its lame right front wheel, which has not turned for years, dragged across the rock and flicked it out of the ground to its new location. The scientists have not yet spotted the divot where the rock popped out, but that spot may be obscured by the rover's solar panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year after year, Opportunity goes farther than anyone dreamed. The expectation had been that it would drive about a kilometer -- six-tenths of a mile -- before dust accumulated on the solar panels and the batteries drained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unexpectedly, fortuitous winds periodically cleaned off the solar panels, and Opportunity, as well as its twin, Spirit, continued to operate. Spirit got stuck in a sand dune 2009 and then fell silent in 2010 after it was not able to point its solar panels toward the sun during the winter months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of one kilometer, Opportunity has driven 38.7 kilometers, or about 24 miles, exploring a series of ever larger craters, taking 170,000 pictures along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a well-made American vehicle,'' said Raymond E. Arvidson, the deputy principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the rover remains in good health, despite the lame wheel, two scientific instruments that are no longer working, and a robotic arm with arthritislike stiffness. John L. Callas, the project manager, said the rover had also suffered an ''amnesia moment,'' probably caused by aging memory chips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just an operational annoyance,'' Dr. Callas said. ''But if it gets precipitously worse, there are some corrective actions we can take.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps a greater obstacle to Opportunity's continued roving might be the limits of NASA's budget. This spring, NASA officials will review all of NASA's spacecraft that have lived beyond their original missions. Opportunity currently costs $14 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to weigh how much money we have and what missions are most productive,'' said Michael Meyer, the lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly discovered rock is like nothing Opportunity has seen. Dr. Squyres said it appeared to have flipped upside down, possibly exposing its underside for the first time in several billion years. ''We're seeing stuff we don't normally get to see,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks like a jelly doughnut,'' he continued: ''White around the outside, red in the middle. We've looked at it with our microscope. It's clearly a rock.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The composition is strange -- high in sulfur, magnesium and manganese. ''This is an ongoing story of discovery,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''Mars keeps throwing new stuff at us.'' At news conferences, NASA now solicits questions from the public via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. That prompted the ''Star Trek'' actor William Shatner to chime in, ''Are you going to cover the alien rock throwers?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Squyres replied that he did not think there were any Martian rock throwers, but another possibility might be that the rock was knocked there by a small asteroid impact nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Friday's issue of the journal Science, scientists report on recent analysis of rocks along the rim of the 14-mile-wide Endeavour Crater where Opportunity is currently exploring. Following readings from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Opportunity headed to rocks that appeared to contain a clay mineral known as iron smectite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Doesn't mean much to many people,'' said Dr. Arvidson, who is the first author on the Science paper. ''But to geologists, it's pretty exciting, because it's a clay mineral that forms in a particular aqueous environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocks, some of them older than the impact that created Endeavour, formed in waters that were much less acidic than existed in most other areas that Opportunity has crossed. That fits with the emerging geological picture of a Mars that was more hospitable in its early days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Squyres said the scientists had set their next major destination as the top of a hill where orbital measurements show even richer clay deposits. That would take a year or two or travel -- if the rover survives both Mars and NASA's budget debates.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDA decade after swinging into orbit around Saturn, NASA's venerable Cassini spacecraft is still working, well beyond the four years of science the space agency had hoped to get. But the spacecraft is running low on maneuvering fuel, and its managers want to end with a scientific bang -- an ambitious agenda that includes 22 orbits through a gap between the planet and its innermost ring before sending the craft on a death plunge into Saturn in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For several months, however, scientists have worried that NASA, financially squeezed like the rest of the federal government, could terminate the mission sooner.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, agency officials, as they do every two years, will conduct a review of the spacecraft that have outlived their original missions. For the 2015 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, NASA faces particularly tough choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars rover Curiosity, which will cost $67.6 million this year to operate, will complete its two-year primary mission in June, so money for continued roving will come out of funds dedicated to ''extended missions.'' For this year, that amount is $140 million, which includes $58.2 million for Cassini. Other extended missions include the Messenger spacecraft at Mercury, the Mars rover Opportunity and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will be a very interesting competition,'' James Green, director of the agency's planetary science division, told a NASA advisory council subcommittee last fall. ''We have two very expensive flagship missions, Cassini and Curiosity, which are expensive to operate even in an extended mission phase, along with a lot of our other missions, which are doing tremendous science at a lower cost. So this particular competition we'll have to do very carefully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one expects NASA to turn off Curiosity, which will not even arrive at its primary science destination until later this year, raising concerns that Cassini may be on the chopping block. All that Linda J. Spilker, its project scientist, would say was, ''I'm hopeful everything will work out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, Dr. Green told scientists that the perception of Cassini versus Curiosity was inaccurate and that officials could instead scale back the cost and scope of the extended missions. NASA could also juggle other money to pay for both Cassini and Curiosity, but that could have consequences like delaying future missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is all part of the process,'' Dr. Green said in an interview. ''I'm asking the scientists not to freak out, not to worry about things they can't control.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration, which proposed deep cuts in the planetary sciences budget the past two years, could also ask for more money for 2015. ''The administration remains committed to operating the pathbreaking Cassini and Curiosity missions as long as they keep passing these rigorous reviews,'' said Phillip Larson, a White House space policy adviser. ''If we keep one going, that doesn't mean we have to cancel the other.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's budget request is likely to be disclosed in late February or early March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Cassini has been studying Saturn and its moons for nearly 10 years, the final orbits would provide new science. The close passes, just above Saturn's cloud tops at 76,000 miles per hour, would not only offer spectacular views, but measure the structure of Saturn's gravitational and magnetic fields just as NASA's $1.1 billion Juno mission is to do at Jupiter. That data would answer seemingly simple questions like how fast Saturn is rotating. So far, scientists have seen only the movements of the uppermost clouds, not what is below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's just a whole new mission almost, waiting for us in the last year of the mission,'' said Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, a senior scientist at the Planetary Sciences Institute in Tucson, who directs NASA's outer-planets assessment group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, Cassini is to make three close flybys of the small moon Enceladus, which is somehow shooting jets of water into space, raising the possibility of liquid water beneath the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throwing away Cassini now, Dr. Hansen-Koharcheck said, ''would just be, I think, a tragic, shortsighted, penny-wise, pound-foolish decision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compressing Cassini's work into fewer years might save money, but Dr. Spilker and Earl Maize, the project manager, said it would not be easy. ''Something very big would have to give,'' Dr. Spilker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for a dip last year caused by the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration, NASA's science research budget has remained relatively steady the last few years, at about $5 billion. But to absorb cost overruns in the development of the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble, the Obama administration proposed cuts to the planetary sciences program. Even though Congress has restored some of the money, financing has been far below what was envisioned just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the current missions send back a bounty of data and discoveries -- ''the amount of science coming out is phenomenal,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science -- the future looks hazier, with fewer missions scheduled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A top priority of planetary scientists is to get a closer look at Europa, one of Jupiter's large moons, which has a large ocean beneath its icy crust, making it one of the most promising places where life could be discovered within the solar system. Putting a spacecraft in orbit around Europa would cost nearly $5 billion, but scientists and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., have figured out a way to accomplish many of the same objectives with a $2 billion spacecraft that simply flies past Europa multiple times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd say it does 80 percent of the science at half the cost,'' said Robert T. Pappalardo, the pre-project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that may be too expensive. SpacePolicyOnline.com reported last month that Charles F. Bolden Jr., NASA's administrator, told the advisory council that it had to stop thinking about so-called flagship missions with price tags over $1 billion. ''The budget doesn't support that,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later, Mr. Bolden said in a statement that the agency remained committed to future flagship missions, but added, ''We are dedicated to pursuing the most cost-effective ways to accomplish this goal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress is pushing NASA in that direction. It allocated $1.345 billion to planetary sciences in the spending bill it passed last week -- $127 million more than the administration had requested -- and directed NASA to spend $80 million of it on preliminary design work for the Europa mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Heidi B. Hammel, head of planetary science at the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>, noted that the field has seen worse days. In 1981, the NASA administrator, James Beggs, offered up the entire planetary science program for sacrifice in response to demands for deep budget cuts by the Reagan administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not as bad as we were then,'' Dr. Hammel said. ''I'm hoping we flatten out. I don't see a downward trend into the ground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ensuing negotiations between Mr. Beggs and White House budget officials, the program was saved, although no new missions were launched until 1989. Scientists came up with a list of four priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth, to study Saturn's largest moon, <span class="companylink">Titan</span>, turned into Cassini.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 22, 2014, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about NASA's budget and the future of some missions referred incorrectly to a proposed mission to Jupiter's moon Europa and misstated the cost. The spacecraft would study the moon through repeated flybys, not enter orbit around Europa, and its estimated cost would be $2 billion, not $5 billion.</p>

Some $100 billion has been invested to build the station, which was completed less than three years ago. The plan had been to allow the station to plunge into the ocean in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very little research was conducted during the 13 years the station was being built; research has only been going at a significant clip since 2011. Allowing the space station to operate to 2024, and possibly beyond, would provide more time for scientific and commercial experiments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American space officials hope that other international partners, including the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, Russia and Japan, will support the extension, but said that if necessary the United States will go it alone.</p>

Operating the space station currently costs the United States about $3 billion a year, a big chunk of the space agency's proposed $17 billion budget, and that cost could grow.

The extra time may encourage more scientists and more private companies to develop research proposals that often take years to plan and carry out. It would give commercial launching companies that carry cargo to the station, and will carry humans starting in 2017, a longer period to recoup their investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most important, it will allow NASA to complete the research that is deemed necessary for preparing for long-duration flights beyond low-Earth orbit, including planned human missions to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s. The research is looking for ways to mitigate many of the health hazards of long-duration flight and will test technologies that are needed to operate safely and productively in deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress seems likely to support the extension because it will provide local jobs and contracts. The budgetary effect will be negligible through 2020. But eventually, Congress will need to decide whether to keep operating the station for as long as its key components last, possibly through 2028 or beyond, use the money for other manned and robotic space missions or supply enough money to do it all. The station ought to be kept in orbit as long as it yields important research findings, but it should not be allowed to cannibalize other important space activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's budget is a tiny part of the trillions of dollars in annual federal spending. Congress ought to appropriate enough money to keep the United States at the forefront in all realms of space research and exploration.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are games apps, and there are games apps. Some gamers like the imagination in fantasy games, some thrill to gory shoot-'em-ups, others love the wonderfully named MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games). Each genre has unique characteristics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's one class of game app that both harks back to the origins of video gaming and shows off the amazing graphics capability of a modern smartphone or tablet: space games. My favorite.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Galaxy on Fire 2 app is one of the best-known 3-D ''space opera'' games. Space operas involve an element of fantasy, combat and intellectual play. There's a good reason for Galaxy on Fire 2's success: It is hugely impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You play the role of Keith T. Maxwell, an experienced human space pilot catapulted to a distant and perilous part of the galaxy. You control Maxwell's ship as it flies through space, and a story unfolds as the app leads you through different missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first the missions are simple, so you can learn the complex controls for the ship's flight, its weapons, navigation, systems upgrades and so on. The learning curve is steep because you have left, right and up and down to manage, and you must also spot targets in different parts of the 3-D environment around you. The game offers lots of automation, however. For example, you can fly manually to specific points in space on missions, or click autopilot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll fly around mining asteroids, running missions for in-game characters and upgrading your vessel's shields. There's also a lot of combat. Chasing enemy ships among the stars and rocks near a planet is enormous fun, with just about the right amount of difficulty. You dock with space stations, fly to different star systems and rendezvous with other ships as part of the unfolding story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all rendered in fabulous 3-D that would look at home on a desktop PC. The HD edition, when run on a top-end device like a new iPhone 5S, even includes extra visual effects like clouds and lens flares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it takes lots of fiddling to learn how to play. Galaxy on Fire 2 HD is free for iOS and Android devices, though the game tries to entice you to make in-app purchases to upgrade your ship. There are also pop-up ads. Other than that, it's great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a completely different space adventure, try Rymdkapsel. This real-time strategy game lets you manage resources to build and expand a space station. The graphics are simple but beautiful, almost abstract, with various components of your space station set out as colored squares on an isometric grid. The idea is to ''mine'' nearby resources in space by extending your station, then convert the minerals into stuff your astronauts can use to build new rooms or weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rymdkapsel's pace is totally different from Galaxy on Fire's, because though you have to defend your space station against alien attack, the speed is limited by how fast the station's occupants move from square to square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game is almost impossible to describe in a few words. But it is hugely satisfying and has intuitive and simple controls. One tip is to turn off the sound because it can get irritating. Another is to set an alarm to remind you to take a break after a decent interval. Gameplay takes only three hours to complete, however; the developers could have easily added more game time. Rymdkapsel is $4 on Android and iOS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could I omit Atari's official free iOS and Android Greatest Hits retro gaming app? Asteroids, an official version of the 2-D vector graphics space classic, involves your ship's surviving a chaotic assault of heavy asteroid rocks, each of which you shoot at to split into pieces that are smaller but move faster, and are therefore potentially trickier to destroy or elude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game is as good as you would expect, coming from Atari. The touch-screen controls may even be a little more intuitive than the big plastic arcade machine controls of old. Just don't expect amazing 3-D graphics -- even though you may get unexpectedly hooked by the strange vector images on the screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have just two complaints. Atari has not upgraded the app in about a year -- which is a shame, given how fast mobile device operating systems evolve. And getting Asteroids, along with 99 other classic Atari space games, will cost $10 through an in-app purchase. There are some goodies in there, like Lunar Lander, where you have to control the angle and thrust of your engine to land softly on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, for a simple and satisfying space game check out F-Sim Space Shuttle, which places you in control of the iconic spacecraft as it comes in to land. You have to rotate your phone to adjust the shuttle's controls, keeping this notoriously nonaerodynamic ''flying brick'' on track for a safe landing. Graphically rich and reasonably rewarding, this app costs $4.50 on Android and $5 on iOS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick Call</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular photography app Fhotoroom for Windows Phone 8 has received an upgrade that adds a few extra photo filters and fixes some bugs. The app includes great image-processing options to trick out your photos and share them online.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said the extra time would lead more scientists to propose experiments, spur a young commercial space industry and allow the space agency to solve health and technical challenges before sending its astronauts on more distant missions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the station were destined for destruction just six years from now, scientists and companies would be more reluctant to invest their time and money, Mr. Gerstenmaier said. ''Potentially, that creates a new economy in space,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two companies, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, fly cargo to the space station, and NASA is looking to hire commercial ''space taxis'' to take astronauts beginning in 2017. Mr. Gerstenmaier said he thought that more companies would now also look at how they could take advantage of the weightlessness of space for profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, NASA studied the station and concluded that it could last until 2028. The other space agencies participating in it, including the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> and those of Russia and Japan, have not decided whether they, too, will continue beyond 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In general, they're all pretty supportive,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said, adding that if necessary, NASA would go it alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the second time the Obama administration has extended the life of the orbiting laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Obama entered the White House, NASA was working to send astronauts back to the moon, and the space station, which was still being built, was to be nudged to a fiery ocean crash in 2016. The cost of operating the station, about $3 billion a year, could then be devoted to the moon program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it always seemed unlikely that the station, which was built at a cost of $100 billion and completed just three years ago, would be discarded that soon, and when the Obama administration announced it wanted to cancel the moon program, it gave the first extension, stretching the life of the station to 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said that unexpected challenges would still pop up at the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is going to be life on the frontier,'' he said. Last month, a valve in a cooling pump failed, curtailing work on the station until astronauts installed a spare pump, an incident that illustrated the need for more reliable systems for deep space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I'm going to go beyond low-Earth orbit, I have a lot of work that I still need to do,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said. ''I need to understand how the human performs in spaceflight. How can I make sure I have a pump system for a three-year or two-year trip to Mars and back?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cargo rocket that was to be launched to the space station on Wednesday by <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> was delayed until at least Thursday, because of an explosion on the sun and the torrent of charged particles that could have interfered with the spacecraft's electronics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arthroscopic knee surgery is no more effective than fake operations for people with a certain kind of injury, according to an unusual study from Finland. People with a torn meniscus (the crescent-shaped cartilage that helps cushion and stabilize knees) were split into groups: One was given surgery, the other only anesthesia and incisions. A year later, most patients in each group said they felt better and would have the procedure again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have identified gene mutations that may explain why Latinos are almost twice as likely to develop Type 2 diabetes as Caucasians and African-Americans. And in a twist, the quirk can be traced to Neanderthals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trying to explain the high rate of Type 2 diabetes among Latinos, an international team of scientists happened on an ancient gene, most likely involved in fat metabolism. Having mutations in that gene raises a person's risk by about 20 percent; having two copies, one from each parent, raises it by 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as I know, this is the first time a version of a gene from Neanderthal has been connected to a modern-day disease,'' David Altshuler, a geneticist at Harvard and an author of the study, told NPR.</p>

The plant, jatropha, whose seeds produce a high-quality oil that can be refined into low-carbon fuel, was once dismissed because it produced too few seeds. But thanks to advances in molecular genetics and DNA sequencing, the start-up SGB domesticated the plant in a few years, rather than decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is also working to identify traits that make certain strains of the plant resistant to heat or cold. If such traits could be identified in cash crops like corn and soybeans, the knowledge could be valuable as climate change accelerates.</p>

For example, people told to say ''I am excited'' before delivering a public speech gave longer, more competent presentations and appeared more relaxed than speakers told to say ''I am calm.'' The shift from anxiety to excitement may be eased by the fact that both are highly aroused states, suggested the author of the study, published in The Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran's state television said the country used liquid fuel for the first time to launch the rocket, named Pajohesh, meaning ''research'' in Persian. The monkey, a male rhesus macaque named Fargam, or ''Auspicious,'' returned to Earth safely, state television said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Television footage showed the rocket blasting off, and the monkey, strapped snugly into a seat. After reaching a height of 72 miles, the report said, Fargam's capsule detached from the rocket and parachuted safely to Earth in a mission that lasted 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran often claims technological breakthroughs that are impossible to independently verify. The Islamic Republic has said it aims to send an astronaut into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The launch of Pajohesh is another long step getting the Islamic Republic of Iran closer to sending a man into space,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States and its allies worry that technology from the space program could also be used to develop long-range missiles that could be armed with nuclear warheads. But after Iran sent a monkey into space for the first time in January, Western experts said the mission appeared to have few military implications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the January mission, one of two official packages of photographs of the simian space traveler depicted the wrong monkey, causing some to speculate that it had died in space or that the launch did not go well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Iranian officials later said one set of pictures showed an archive photograph of an alternate monkey. They said that three to five monkeys were simultaneously tested for flights and that two or three were selected as finalists. The one best suited for the mission is then chosen.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- China on Saturday became the third country to steer a spacecraft onto the moon after its unmanned Chang'e-3 probe settled onto the Bay of Rainbows, state-run television reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States and the Soviet Union are the other countries to have accomplished so-called soft landings on the moon -- in which a craft can work after landing -- and 37 years have passed since the last such mission.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful arrival of the Chang'e-3 after a 13-day journey from Earth was reported on Chinese state television. Chinese news websites displayed what they said was a photograph from the craft of the moon's surface. At the time of the last soft landing, by the Soviet Union in 1976, Mao Zedong lay a month from death and China was in the twilight of his chaotic Cultural Revolution. Now China, much richer and stronger, aspires to become a globally respected power, and the government sees a major presence in space as a key to acquiring technological prowess, military strength and sheer status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese media celebrated the landing as a demonstration of the country's growing scientific stature. Television reports showed engineers at the mission control center in Beijing crying, embracing and taking pictures of one another on their cellphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The dream of the Chinese people across thousands of years of landing on the moon has finally been realized with Chang'e,'' said the China News Service, a state-run news agency. ''By successfully joining the international deep-space exploration club, we finally have the right to share the resources on the moon with developed countries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chang'e-3 landing craft carried a solar-powered, robotic rover called the Jade Rabbit, or Yutu in Mandarin Chinese, which was to emerge several hours later to begin exploring Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, a relatively smooth plain formed from solidified lava. According to a Chinese legend, Chang'e is a moon goddess, accompanied by a Jade Rabbit that can brew potions that offer immortality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very ambitious mission in the sense that it's a rover with a fair amount of instruments on it,'' said Andrew Chaikin, a space historian and an expert on lunar travel. The instruments include radar to gather information about what lies as deep as 300 feet below the surface, Chinese space scientists have said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is the potential that some really interesting science could come out of this,'' Mr. Chaikin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mission also embodies China's broader ambitions in space, other experts said. The Chang'e-3 mission is honing technology for future missions while also emphasizing exploration. The landing craft appears capable of carrying a payload more than a dozen times the weight of the 309-pound rover, Paul D. Spudis, a scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although it will do some new science, its real value is to flight-qualify a new and potentially powerful lunar surface payload delivery system,'' Dr. Spudis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A later Chang'e mission, sometime before 2020, is intended to bring back rocks and other samples from the moon, and that will need a larger craft capable of sending a vehicle back to Earth. That mission will also need a more powerful launch rocket, which China is also developing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a decade, China could also become the only country with an operating space station. The International Space Station, which has been open to astronauts from 15 countries, is due to be decommissioned by 2020, and China's own, much smaller station could be ready to go up about the same time, if preparations go smoothly. China is not among the countries allowed to use the international station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its benign name, China's Jade Rabbit rover could kindle anxieties among some American politicians and policy makers that the United States risks losing its pre-eminence in space in coming decades. China's opaque space bureaucracy is overseen by the military, and that has magnified wariness. Legislation passed by Congress in 2011 bars NASA from bilateral contacts with China, although multilateral contacts are not proscribed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, some Chinese space engineers have also enthusiastically endorsed eventually taking astronauts to the moon and back, which would make China the second country, after the United States, to achieve that feat. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A policy paper in 2011 said China would ''conduct studies on the preliminary plan for a human lunar landing,'' but the government has not made any decision on a manned mission, said Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the United States Naval War College in Rhode Island who researches China's space activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, they are putting all the building blocks in place so that if they make that policy decision, they can move forward,'' said Professor Johnson-Freese. ''But the Chinese are not risk-takers. They are not going to approve that program until they are sure they are capable of all those building blocks.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 3.5 billion years ago -- around the time life is thought to have first arisen on Earth -- Mars had a large freshwater lake that might well have been hospitable to life, scientists reported Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lake lay in the same crater where NASA's Mars rover Curiosity landed last year and has been exploring ever since. It lasted for hundreds or thousands of years, and possibly much longer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether any life ever appeared on Mars is not yet known, and Curiosity was not designed to answer that question. But the data coming back from the planet indicate that the possibility of life, at least in the ancient past, is at least plausible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John P. Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology who is the project scientist for the Curiosity mission, said that if certain microbes like those on present-day Earth had plopped into that ancient Martian lake, they would most likely have found a pleasant place to call home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The environment would have existed long enough that they could have been sustained, prospered, grown, multiplied,'' he said. ''All the essential ingredients for life were present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Potentially the aqueous stream, lake, groundwater system could have existed for millions to tens of millions of years,'' he added. ''You could easily get a lake with the area of the Finger Lakes in upstate New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interpretation comes from detailed analysis of two mudstones drilled by Curiosity earlier this year. The structure, chemistry and mineralogy of the sedimentary rocks were not alien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole thing just seems extremely Earthlike,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists presented their latest findings at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco and in a set of six articles published in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surface of Mars today is frigid and arid, bombarded by sterilizing radiation, but after it formed and cooled with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, it was initially a warmer and wetter place during its first billion years. Over the past decade, scientists have identified several sites on Mars that they think were once habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, after NASA's rover Opportunity discovered evidence that the Martian places it was traversing had once been soaking wet, Steven W. Squyres, the mission's principal investigator, declared, ''This is the kind of place that would have been suitable for life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that location would have been an extremely challenging environment for life to take hold -- very salty and highly acidic. Later, the scientists said the soils had been soaked not so much by water as by sulfuric acid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA chose the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater as Curiosity's landing site because readings from orbit identified the presence of clay minerals, which form in waters with a neutral pH. Curiosity's instruments indeed detected clays in the two mudstones, named John Klein and Cumberland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clays appear to have formed at the lake bottom, not swept down from the walls of Gale Crater, strengthening the case that the lake water was not acidic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity also measured carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus, elements that are critical for life on Earth, as well as iron and sulfur minerals that could have served as food for microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there were microbial organisms around, I think they would have liked that environment,'' said David T. Vaniman, a researcher at the <span class="companylink">Planetary Science Institute</span> in Tucson and the lead author of a Science paper examining the mineralogy. On Earth, a class of such microbes known as chemolithoautotrophs live in caves, hydrothermal vents and the deep underground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An impact, probably by an asteroid, excavated Gale Crater 3.6 billion to 3.8 billion years ago, and the John Klein and Cumberland mudstones formed out of sediments that subsequently accumulated in the crater. That is roughly the same age as rocks on Earth with the earliest signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can actually begin to line up in time what the Earth was doing and what Mars was doing,'' Dr. Grotzinger said. ''It's kind of cool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gale Crater lake was also of the same era as the sulfuric-acid-soaked rocks that Opportunity found. That suggests that as Mars dried out, conditions in different regions varied widely. ''Things have just gotten more complex than we thought,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, even though the rocks formed in a lake, soluble elements like sodium and calcium had not been washed away. That suggests that the climate even then was cold and arid, just not as cold and arid as it is today -- perhaps an ice-covered lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What does it mean about the climate?'' Dr. Vaniman said. ''It's something we're all thinking about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has not been found yet is solid evidence for the carbon molecules known as organics that could serve as the building blocks of life. Such molecules are not always preserved in stone and are destroyed by radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By measuring the abundance of certain elements, a technique that has long been used to date Earth rocks, Kenneth A. Farley, a professor of geochemistry at Caltech, was able to estimate that the sediments eroded from rocks 4.2 billion years old, give or take 350 million years, and that the rocks had been exposed at the surface for about 80 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, planetary scientists estimated ages by counting craters -- the older a surface, the greater the number of craters. Dr. Farley's numbers fit with expectations for the Gale Crater rocks -- ''it's a nice demonstration this method could work,'' Dr. Farley said -- and the dating technique could help locate rocks that have been exposed to radiation recently, raising the odds of finding organics, if they are present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a big step forward for the exploration of life on Mars,'' Dr. Grotzinger said. ''We're now exploring for that subset of environments can preserve organic carbon.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet ISON passed within a million miles of the sun's surface at 1:37 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday -- by which time observers had already glumly concluded that the comet had disintegrated and vaporized.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA posted on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, ''It's likely it didn't survive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISON, which spent several billion years at the frigid edge of the solar system before starting a long journey toward the sun, had been billed as a possible ''comet of the century.'' Its demise seemed to be an anticlimactic ending to the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''then it appears again,'' said Karl Battams, an astrophysicist at the Naval Research Laboratory who has been observing the comet from Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. ''We see something come out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Images taken by spacecraft showed an increasingly bright point at the head of the comet. Dr. Battams said that current data could not offer a definitive answer, but it appeared Friday that part of ISON's nucleus was still holding together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's definitely maybe alive,'' Dr. Battams said. ''There's a strong definite chance it might be, may be alive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional observations by spacecraft and ground-based telescopes could provide a clearer picture over the next few days. The Hubble Space Telescope should be able to take a close look in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account, Dr. Battams mused, ''So, umm ... did I mention that comets are like cats??''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Comet ISON may have survived its brush with the sun. Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more uncertain is whether there will be much to see in the night sky in early December, when ISON is to pass through Earth's neighborhood. (One thing is certain, astronomers say: There is no possibility that it will strike Earth.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent resurrection raised the question: if ISON is not dead, why did it disappear during its close approach to the sun?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point, we don't have an answer to that,'' said C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the heliophysics division at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tale has gathered a wide following on the Internet, with Dr. Battams juggling media interviews and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> postings while also trying to digest the stream of data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got spotlights on us, literally,'' he said in an interview, adding that he had slept only a couple of hours. ''It's a lot of pressure because at present we have a lot more questions than answers. But it's fabulous. It's an amazing event we're witnessing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Dr. Battams and Dr. Young answered questions in a NASA-organized chat room on <span class="companylink">Google</span> as ISON neared the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft sent back an image that was expected to show the comet within the corona. It showed nothing, but it was possible the comet was not close enough yet. ''We thought maybe we wouldn't see something right away,'' Dr. Young said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half an hour later, another image came back, again with no sign of ISON.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't see anything -- nothing -- and we expected we would see at least a little bit,'' Dr. Young said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A much smaller comet last year had given an impressive show, and scientists expected that even if ISON started falling apart, there would still be big pieces left for the observatory to detect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were extremely let down by the lack of a show,'' Dr. Young said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a couple of hours later, another NASA spacecraft spotted something emerging from the other side of the sun. At first it seemed to be nothing more than debris from the comet's tail. Dr. Young left for home thinking the day had been a bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he was driving, he heard his cellphone buzzing as text messages poured in. He pulled over to take a look at the data. More images were showing indications of a surviving nucleus. He headed to a diner that was closed for Thanksgiving but whose Wi-Fi network was on. ''I pulled out my laptop to see what I could see,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news that reports of ISON's death were premature ricocheted around <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. Richard Branson, the British billionaire who founded the constellation of Virgin companies, posted on Friday: ''Our sun melts most of comet #ISON. A little survives to fly on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists hope that observations of ISON will also provide information about the early solar system when ISON formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, comet experts are cautious about saying what they expect to happen next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISON, Dr. Battams said, ''is taking every opportunity to do everything we didn't expect it to do.''</p>

What falls there are, we know not; what rocks beset the channel, we know not; what walls ride over the river, we know not. Ah, well! we may conjecture many things.''â€‰ -- John Wesley Powell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Wesley Powell is one of my heroes. One hundred and forty three years ago from the day that our Curiosity rover landed on Mars (Aug. 5, 2012), the one-armed Civil War veteran led nine men in four wooden dories down the untamed and uncharted Colorado River and into the equally untamed and uncharted Grand Canyon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been thinking about Powell a lot lately as there seem to be some un-Earthly parallels between what occurred in the magnificent desolation of the northern Arizona desert so long ago, and what is happening on Mars today. Those multitoned buttes and mesas, and that incandescent sequence of colorful bands that make one of the natural wonders of the world so grand, can also be found over 100 million miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Powell Geographic Expedition was a turning point in understanding the geologic history not just of the region, or even continent, but our entire planet. With NASA's Curiosity mission, we have not only redefined what Mars once was, we found it to be more welcoming to life than we knew. We also are roving our way to another potential turning point. And this one looks a lot like the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, we all know what the Grand Canyon looks like. But 143 years ago Powell and his team had only a vague sense of what lay ahead. Three hundred years before Powell, Spanish conquistadors became the first Europeans to visit the canyon. Three even managed to make it a third of the way down the southern rim before thirst and a sense of self-preservation got the better of them. Others came later and wondered at the majesty of it all, but before 1869 no one with a scientific eye had looked up from its mile-deep floor and asked, ''What does this mean?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powell was not only one heck of a scientist, he was also a real mensch. During the Battle of Shiloh in the American Civil War, he lost part of his right arm to a rifle ball. A staunch believer in the Union cause, he returned and participated in several more campaigns. He even struck up a friendship with Ulysses S. Grant, the commander of the Union armies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever the rock hound, ''the Major'' (as he preferred to be called) made a study of the fossils he found in the trenches at the Battle of Vicksburg. After the war, he became a professor of natural sciences at Illinois Wesleyan University, but left the position when the urge to explore the American West overwhelmed him. (A side story, also after the war: Powell befriended a Confederate officer who lost his left arm at Shiloh. From then on, whenever either one purchased a set of gloves, he sent the unneeded glove to the other.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, lacking part of an arm, the Major did not count white-water rafting and climbing cliff faces as part of his skill set. Even with all his book learning and field work, the man did not have a clue about what he was getting into. But he did have an idea of what he was searching for. He knew it was all conjecture, but Powell had the kind of scientific hunch that comes from years of work in the field. That is why he went.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shooting the uncharted rapids whenever possible, and portaging their heavy oak and pine boats when it was impossible (which was quite often), the first scientific expedition of the Grand Canyon wound its way through the alcoves, crags and amphitheaters of the canyon in an effort to chart it and document its geologic history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powell's expedition rewrote the textbooks of our planet's history. Equipped with barometers, chronometers, thermometers, compasses, notebooks and pencils, the Major and his crew began filling in glaring holes in Earth's historical record. Among their finds was that the thick successions of rock layers that help make the Grand Canyon so awe-inspiring constitute one of the richest geologic archives anywhere in the world. In addition, a radical idea took root in Powell's mind that the canyon itself was formed as the Colorado River chewed its way slowly, over millions of years, through a vertical mile of rock. Even more improbably, if the river took millennia to dissect a mile-thick pile of rock layers, then how old were the layers themselves?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thoughts like these were among the most profound of the mid-19th century, as the world wrestled to come to grips with the notion of ''deep time,'' the great antiquity of the Earth, and the concept that some geologic processes follow the inexorable slow march of time rather than sudden, cataclysmic events like earthquakes and floods. Given enough time, the logic goes, water can cleave solid rock and mountains can be reduced to plains. This ''gradualism'' now underpins modern geologic thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two Powell expeditions (he braved the muddy-brown Colorado white water again in 1871) provided the public with mesmerizing tales of the American West and challenged scientific canon. Now we are on our way to doing the same thing on Marsâ€‰ -- â€‰though, happily, our science team is composed not of nine men but of 472 men and women representing 13 different countries. In the 16 months since Curiosity's arrival, we have already achieved our main goals. Just eight months into the mission, the rover discovered that beneath its six flight-grade aluminum wheels was the dried-out husk of an ancient streambed and lake of fresh water. The kind of water that could have supported simple microorganismsâ€‰ -- â€‰low in salt, free of strong acid and full of nutrients. A human might even have been able to drink the stuff, though you may not have wanted to bottle it for resale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.U.V.-size roverâ€‰ -- â€‰with its laboratory of spectrometers, lasers, X-ray diffractometer, radiation detector, neutron generator, 17 cameras, and its own weather stationâ€‰ -- â€‰has pushed deep into the environmental records of early Martian history. Data from Curiosity show that sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbonâ€‰ -- â€‰some of the key chemical ingredients for lifeâ€‰ -- â€‰were available to microbes, had they ever originated on Mars. These primitive organisms could have fed on the chemical energy stored in rocks and minerals, just like a flashlight bulb lights up by using the chemicals stored in a dry cell battery. It all depends on the state of mineral oxidation, the flow of electrons through rocks and microbes, and chemolithoautotrophy (if you want to get into it). Some microbes on Earth survive by consuming exactly this type of energy source. They eat rocks. Might the same have occurred on ancient Mars? It is pretty cool, and it brings us closer to finding out if life ever originated somewhere other than Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you read this, Curiosity is driving across a flat plain and closing the distance on the base of Mount Sharp, a massive mountain formed from a stack of layered rocks three times higher than the Grand Canyon is deep. Of course, moving forward at about half a football field per day, we are still many months away. That's O.K. The roads are unpaved and the nearest mechanic is millions of miles distant. We want to get there in good shape, and we will. With each passing day Curiosity beams back images of Mount Sharp's foothills growing larger in the windshield, and with them our sense of the story about to unfold. But as close as we are to the mountain, it's hard to not look at each other, surrounded by computers and whiteboards, and ask, ''Are we there yet?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now we can only wonder about the potential of Mount Sharp. Like the Grand Canyon, it is displaying its pages from a book of ancient history. Its layers are capsules from the basement of time and our Curiosity has the cipher to decode their meaning. We don't yet know what story it will tell, but we expect it to be a good read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps we will learn that billions of years ago a large lake stood where Mount Sharp rises today, or that springs flowed down its sides. Maybe we'll find evidence that the rock layers are exposed on the flanks of Mount Sharp not because a river carved through them over millions of years, but because the wind blew against them for billions of yearsâ€‰ -- â€‰the ultimate in gradualism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we must also be prepared to read a grim epitaph for a planet struggling to cope with irreversible environmental decline. Billions of years ago, Mars underwent a monumental shift in its environment when it lost much of its water to space. Think of it as the ''Great Drying.'' Today the Red Planet is more parched than a bone, and we don't know why this climatic deterioration occurred at a time when Earth was flourishing with life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, I know what question you want to ask. Was there, or is there, life up there? As chief scientist for Curiosity, I get that one all the time. The simple but somewhat agonizing answer isâ€‰, I couldn't tell youâ€‰ -- â€‰and it is more than likely our Curiosity rover will not be able to tell you either. It wasn't designed to do that. Our mission is to examine evidence of environmental conditions favorable for life, how those environments changed, and whether they were right for preserving evidence about life, if it did exist there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rest assured, our curiosity eventually will win out and we will know. NASA plans to launch a rover in 2020 that will collect promising samples, perhaps from places similar to those Curiosity has explored. These can be returned to Earth, where we can look directly for signs of past life on Mars. It is the logical next step. What this next rover will discover, like Powell in the Grand Canyon, we know not. We may only conjecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing I can tell you is I can't wait.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet ISON's close approach -- and its possible demise, from the sun's heat and gravitational forces -- will give scientists an unprecedented look at the ingredients that came together to form the planets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the comet survives -- though many experts like Dr. Lisse think it will not -- it could provide a bright and striking addition to the night sky in early December as it zooms near Earth on its way back out. The best times for viewing would be right before sunrise or right after sunset. Currently it is not readily visible because it is too close to the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, astronomers have spotted many sun-grazing comets, but this one is different. Named for the International Scientific Optical Network in Russia, which discovered it in September 2012, it appears to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of debris about a light-year from the sun. Most of the earlier sun grazers appear to be pieces from a larger comet that looped around the sun many times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISON was probably dislodged a few million years ago by the gravitational nudge of a passing star, sending it on a trajectory to the inner solar system for the first time and quite possibly the last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And we're going to watch it bake and boil,'' Dr. Lisse said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's fleet of spacecraft, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have been taking pictures as the comet entered the inner solar system. ''This particular comet is of extreme interest to us,'' said James L. Green, the director of planetary science at NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few comets are discovered so far out, and some scientists at first thought ISON was several miles in diameter and would become the ''Comet of the Century,'' rivaling the brightness of a full moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the comet passed Mars, the NASA orbiter took pictures showing that it was three-quarters of a mile wide at most, smaller than most comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because ISON was discovered so far away, astronomers had plenty of time to plan their observations. Measurements by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which takes infrared photographs, showed a large envelope of carbon dioxide around the nucleus. ''It is looking like carbon dioxide may be a very fundamental molecule in that early solar system rather than carbon monoxide,'' Dr. Lisse said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As ISON approaches the sun, the motions of its tail reveal the usually invisible movements in the solar wind, the torrent of particles continually ejected by the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent days, the comet has behaved erratically, brightening and dimming; that has led to speculation that it has already fallen apart. ''We just don't know if it's in one piece or not,'' said Karl Battams, an astrophysicist at the Naval Research Laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even falling apart could be valuable. Dr. Lisse said scientists understood how fine dust particles conglomerated into larger particles the size of BBs and marbles, and they know how comet-size objects can combine into planets. But they have not figured out how the BB- and marble-size objects combine into comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the BBs and the marbles hit each other, they fall apart,'' Dr. Lisse said. By looking at the process in reverse, he went on, scientists can ''see how it got put together'' in the first place.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON THE GULF OF AQABA, Jordan -- I AM walking across the world. In January I set out on foot from Herto Bouri, an early site of Homo sapiens fossils in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia, to retrace the pathways of the first anatomically modern humans who colonized the planet at least 60,000 years ago. My finish line is in Tierra del Fuego, at the chilly tip of South America, the last nook of the continents settled by our ancestors. This long ramble will last seven continuous years. It will span 21,000 miles. (I have logged about 1,700 miles to date.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm writing dispatches along the way for National Geographic on subjects as varied as human evolution and conflict, nomadism and climate change. The ''Out of Eden Walk,'' as I'm calling it, uses deep history as a mirror for current events. But even as I adhere strictly to my brand of bipedal journalism, trying as it were to put myself in a Pleistocene state of mind, cars keep roaring into my awareness. They are inescapable. They are without a doubt the defining artifacts of our civilization. They have reshaped our minds in ways that we long ago ceased thinking about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I inch from the poorer subtropical latitudes into the richer temperate zones of the planet, for example, there has been a dramatic shift in human consciousness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the walk's start in the Horn of Africa, one of the last habitable places on earth where automobiles remain scarce -- according to the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>, Ethiopia musters perhaps two or three motor vehicles per 1,000 people -- walking was a near-universal activity. The Rift Valley desert and people's relationship to it are still shaped by the human foot. Trails unspool everywhere. Everyone functions as a competent walking guide -- even small children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once I crossed the Red Sea on a camel boat to the Middle East, where car ownership explodes to 300 or more vehicles per 1,000 citizens (the figure in the United States balloons to about 800), I'd entered a region subjugated utterly by the vulcanized rubber tire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Saudi Arabia, I had trouble simply communicating with motorists who have lost the ability to imagine unconstrained movement to any point on the horizon. Asking directions is often pointless. Like drivers everywhere, their frame of reference is rectilinear and limited to narrow ribbons of space, axle-wide, that rocket blindly across the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why did you leave the road?'' one Saudi friend asked me, puzzled, when I improvised an obvious shortcut across a mountain range. ''The highway is always straighter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To him, the earth's surface beyond the pavement was simply a moving tableau -- a gauzy, unreal backdrop for his high-speed travel. He was spatially crippled. The writer Rebecca Solnit nails this mind-set perfectly in her book ''Wanderlust: A History of Walking'': ''In a sense the car has become a prosthetic, and though prosthetics are usually for injured or missing limbs, the auto-prosthetic is for a conceptually impaired body or a body impaired by the creation of a world that is no longer human in scale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I just call it Car Brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incidence of Car Brain grows with rising latitudes across the surface of the world. (Then it vanishes at the poles, where Plane Brain replaces it.) In the affluent Global North, this syndrome will be familiar to any hiker who has had to share a walked landscape with motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cocooned inside a bubble of loud noise and a tonnage of steel, members of the internal combustion tribe tend to adopt ownership of all consumable space. They roar too close. They squint with curiosity out of the privacy of their cars as if they themselves were invisible. In Saudi Arabia, this sometimes meant a total loss of privacy as Bedouins in pickups, soldiers in S.U.V.'s and curiosity seekers in sedans circled my desert camps as if visiting an open-air zoo, gaping at the novelty of a man on foot with two cargo camels. Other motorists steered next to my elbow for hundreds of yards, interrogating me through a rolled-down car window. (Not to pick on Saudi Arabia, which is no worse than any other Car Brain society, but exactly one driver in 700 miles of walking in the kingdom bothered to park and stroll along for a while.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More striking than a Car Brain's impaired road etiquette, though, are the slow pleasures it misses in life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Car Brain will never know the ceremony of authentic departures and arrivals. Towns and villages that were mere smears of speed along busy superhighways were celebratory events savored by my Saudi walking partners and me. Our step lightened with anticipation as we wandered into the outskirts. We laughed. We felt good: flushed with accomplishment. Similarly, packing our camel bags and walking out of a town was a special moment -- an embarkation that signaled a tangible advance through space and time, and not the commuter's inconvenience of simply ''getting there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car Brains have lost all knowledge of human interactions on foot. People stiffen when they see a pedestrian approaching from a distance. But they relax and smile as they hear your voice, see your empty (unarmed) hands. In Africa and in the remnant pastoral communities of Arabia you must stand dozens of yards away from huts and homes, waiting politely to be noticed, before exchanging greetings. A lovely courtliness marks these bipedal encounters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AND then there is simply the act of traveling through the world at three miles per hour -- the speed at which we were biologically designed to move. There is something mesmerizing about this pace that I still can't adequately describe. While roaming the old pilgrim roads in Saudi Arabia, I came to understand how the journey to Mecca -- the hajj -- in the pre-airline days was perhaps as important as reaching Islam's holiest city. Watching the Red Sea slide by my left shoulder as I walked north, seeing the white desert coast dance with ink-blue waters as one bay after another scalloped by, put me in a meditative trance that must be primordial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are natural, limbic connections that reach back to the basement of time -- ones that Car Brains rarely experience. I must continually remind motorists that what I am doing is not extreme. Anthropologists have strapped G.P.S. devices to the Hadza people of Tanzania, among the last hunter-gatherers left on earth, and discovered that the men walk on average seven miles a day in pursuit of game. (Women a little less.) This adds up to 2,500 miles annually, or tramping from New York to Los Angeles every year. Given that this ancient economy is one that dominated 95 percent of human history, walking that distance is our norm. Sitting down is what's radical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have nothing personal against motorized travel. Cars build middle classes. They grant us undreamed-of freedom. And I suspect that I'll be driving away from my walk's end point in Chile in 2020. But it's probably inevitable that, as I plod through the Middle East, Asia and the Americas over the next six years, I'll become increasingly alienated from the growing bulk of humanity afflicted by Car Brain. The internal combustion engine has affected more drastic changes on human culture -- flattening it through the annihilation of time and space -- than the web revolution. Indeed, the century-old automotive revolution prepared the way for the rise of the Internet, by eroding the capacity for attention, for patience, by fomenting a cult of speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can be lonely out here among the Car Brains. Sometimes, out walking, I feel like a ghost. Already, I have to seek out society's marginal people to find my way across the planet. Settled nomads. The ambulatory poor. The very ancient, whose mode of transport is still a donkey or maybe a cart, elders who haven't forgotten about earned distances. They point to referents beyond the aphasia of paved roads. I take my compass bearings off their paupers' hands.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW DELHI -- IF you want to marry in India and are looking for a bride or groom, normally you need to consult an astrologer, to learn whether the position of the planet Mars is favorable on your birth chart. If not, you may find it difficult to get the match of your choice. Lately, some employers have been trying this as well, matching their horoscopes with those of their prospective employees; companies are also comparing horoscopes with their clients for good fortune.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influence of Mars and the other planets on the life of an average Indian cannot be forgotten, especially this month. On Nov. 5, a Tuesday -- Mangalvaar in Hindi, named for the planet Mars -- India launched its first mission to the red planet. The day before, the chairman of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span> paid a visit to a temple, to seek the blessings of Lord Venkateswara. If the mission is successful, the Mars Orbiter will study the planet's atmosphere and mineralogy, map its surface and test for methane, a possible sign of the presence of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite significant scientific achievements, many Indians are still guided by superstition, which sometimes is reflected in poor decision making. For example, mothers are often blamed if they do not give birth to a male child. As recently as 2009, the government of Karnataka, a southern state, provided funds to temples for performing religious rituals to nullify the so-called evil effects of a solar eclipse (and this is in the state whose capital, Bangalore, is home to the space research headquarters).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the common Indian man is drawn to the country's scientific developments. He is well versed in jugaad -- a word we use to describe a kind of traditional, frugal innovation system. The term became popular in the 1990s, and comes from the name of a rural vehicle, designed by villagers who combined an old chassis with an engine commonly used for irrigation pumps. (Today, the Tata Nano car can be seen as an advanced form of jugaad.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years since independence in 1947, when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru called for creating a ''scientific temper'' among Indian citizens, the government has been investing in science. India has joined the club of the few countries to have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, from mining to waste disposal. It has designed and operated its own satellites. If the Mars Orbiter successfully reaches the vicinity of the planet in September 2014, after 300 days' journey into deep space, it will make India the first Asian country and the fourth in the world to reach the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission has, however, started an intense debate. While its supporters trumpet its incredibly low cost of around $75 million (a fraction of the cost of a similar American expedition), critics question the logic behind spending any amount when India is dealing with such deep-rooted problems as widespread hunger, poverty and corruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One activist, Harsh Mander, said the mission showed a ''remarkable indifference to the dignity of the poor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But U. R. Rao, a former chairman of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span>, compared the $75 million spent on the mission to the amount Indians spend on Diwali crackers for one day: ''For going all the way to Mars, just one-tenth of the money is being spent. So, why are they shouting?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason the mission is so much less expensive is that it is able to take advantage of existing deep space communications systems and navigation support from NASA. But India is becoming known for its low-cost innovations in many diverse fields, including health care, renewable energy, sanitation, mobile technology and tablet computers. Indian scientists like to share this anecdote: ''Americans spent millions to develop a pen that will not leak in space, whereas Russians used a pencil!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past decades, an impression was formed that truly innovative research had to be expensive, and ''frugal'' solutions were written off as low-tech products directed at the poor, says Rajnish Tiwari, a senior researcher at the Institute of Technology and Innovation Management at Hamburg University of Technology. The Mars mission shows that frugal innovations can be high-tech and affordable at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many have also dismissed the criticisms by pointing out how much India spends on far less productive projects. For instance, Narendra Modi, the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat and one of the leading contenders for the post of prime minister in next year's elections, has announced the erection of a commemorative statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first deputy prime minister, that is expected to be double the size of the Statue of Liberty and to cost a whopping $340 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money spent on the Mars mission is a small investment in the big picture. It is a chance to increase the popularity of science and inspire people from all walks of life, both in India and outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still have a long way to go to counter backward superstitions, but we are making progress. During the total solar eclipse of Feb. 16, 1980, most people were too afraid to even come out of their houses. Leading up to the total solar eclipse of Oct. 24, 1995, however, an awareness campaign was carried out, and as a result, many villagers put on solar-filter glasses and joined the scientists to watch the spectacular celestial phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope that the Mars mission will bring about a greater interest in learning about science, and an end to many of the superstitions associated with the planet. This does not mean that our brides and grooms need to give up all their old beliefs, as there are many aspects of Indian tradition worth preserving. But this too, is possible, for India is a country of contrasts. We know how to embrace two ideas at once -- tradition and science, frugality and innovation -- just as we can deal with issues like poverty at the same time as taking a giant leap into interplanetary space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An international team of scientists reported on Thursday that over a two-year period they had detected 28 of these particles, known as neutrinos, that arrived from outside the solar system and possibly from across the universe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This gives us a new way to do astronomy,'' said Francis Halzen, a physics professor at the University of Wisconsin who is the principal investigator for the project, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The findings appear in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1987, detectors in the United States, Japan and Russia noted two dozen neutrinos that originated from a supernova explosion of a star about 165,000 light-years away. That was the first and last time distant neutrinos had been detected until the IceCube observatory, largely financed by the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span>, started its observations in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 5,000 sensors have been lowered and frozen into a cubic kilometer (about one-quarter cubic mile) of Antarctic ice, looking for flashes of blue light that are given off by the cascades of debris generated by a neutrino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neutrinos are ghostlike particles that interact only very rarely with the rest of the universe. The fusion reactions that power the sun give off a flood of neutrinos, but almost all of them go undetected and unfelt: Every second, trillions of them pass through every person on earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IceCube, built over a decade at a cost of $271 million, ignores the solar neutrinos, but is instead searching for those coming from cataclysmic events elsewhere in the galaxy or even farther away. Until they looked, scientists did not know what they would find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I actually think the most surprising thing is that they show up when they were expected,'' Dr. Halzen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists named the newly discovered neutrinos after ''Sesame Street'' characters. The two most energetic of the 28 are Bert and Ernie; two others are called Miss Piggy and Snuffleupagus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third year of data, not reported in the Science paper, an even more energetic neutrino appeared. That one is called Big Bird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Halzen said some of the 28 might have come from our own Milky Way galaxy, but others originated farther away. ''Some of them are certainly extragalactic,'' he said. IceCube detects only one out of a million neutrinos, which means about 28 million neutrinos from outside the solar system passed through during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because neutrinos so rarely collide with anything, detecting them requires a great deal of material -- in the case of IceCube, the vast expanse of ice readily available at the South Pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in a great while, a neutrino does collide with something, setting off a cascade of electrons and other subatomic debris. Charged particles in a transparent material like ice give off blue light. Phototubes record the bursts of light, and from the patterns, scientists can determine the direction and energy of the incoming neutrinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although IceCube is not tuned to find the low-energy neutrinos from supernovas in the galactic neighborhood, another explosion like the one observed in 1987 would be a bonanza for IceCube. It would register about 100,000 neutrinos, Dr. Halzen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, most telescopes have looked at the universe by gathering photons, or particles of light, including lower-energy radio waves, visible light, X-rays and gamma rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very-high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube open a new spectrum for observing the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more observations, the scientists hope to be able to determine where the neutrinos originated, whether from black holes or the rapidly rotating burned-out stars known as pulsars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John G. Learned, a professor of physics at the University of Hawaii who is not part of the IceCube team, said its conclusion that the 28 neutrinos came from beyond the solar system was convincing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what was surprising is that IceCube did not detect neutrinos of even higher energies than Bert, Ernie and Big Bird, which was expected given current ideas of the cosmic processes thought to generate them. ''They're not there,'' Dr. Learned said. ''We don't understand that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added: ''That's the kind of situation we love. A mystery may mean we may learn some fundamentally new science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a tantalizing hint that some of the neutrinos are coming from the center of our own galaxy. That too would be surprising, because anything there creating neutrinos should also be creating very-high-energy cosmic rays and gamma rays, which are not seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Halzen said it was too early to tell for sure. ''We now know what we're looking for, and we'll figure it out,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As early as the end of December, the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> plans to launch GAIA, a star surveyor and mapper, into an orbit beyond the moon. Its job will be to map the locations and motions of a billion stars in the galaxy. Among other things, it will reveal which stars have planets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, NASA is planning to launch TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which will scan the entire sky, looking for exoplanets orbiting nearby stars, within 100 light-years or so. Its goal is to find the 1,000 ''best exoplanets,'' in the words of George Ricker, the M.I.T. physicist who is leading the effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same year, the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> hopes to launch Cheops, the Characterizing ExOplanets Satellite. It will also carry a photometer to monitor the dimming of stars from planet transits and will target stars where planets have already been discovered by other means in an effort to measure their sizes and densities. That agency has also been working on Plato, short for Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars, a sort of super-Kepler, which could launch in 2024, if all goes well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missions like these are intended to identify nearby exoplanets and thus set the stage for future projects that could obtain images or spectra of these planets and investigate their atmospheres and other features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of these is a telescope built for a spy satellite, the same size and make as the Hubble Space Telescope that was bequeathed to NASA two years ago. It is being considered for a mission to study dark energy and exoplanets in the 2020s. NASA astronomers have recently added a coronagraph (which could block the glare of a planet's home star and make the planet itself visible), to their wish list for the mission, now known as Wfirst-Afta, short for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope -- Astrophysics-Focused Telescope Assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other astronomers, however, think that the former spy telescope is not well suited to a coronagraph and that a simpler space telescope would be better. So NASA has also begun studies of smaller space missions that could have an internal coronagraph or a star shade hovering in front of the telescope. DENNIS OVERBYE</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEMPE, Ariz. -- THE recent announcement by a team of astronomers that there could be as many as 40 billion habitable planets in our galaxy has further fueled the speculation, popular even among many distinguished scientists, that the universe is teeming with life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomer Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, an experienced planet hunter and co-author of the study that generated the finding, said that it ''represents one great leap toward the possibility of life, including intelligent life, in the universe.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''possibility'' is not the same as likelihood. If a planet is to be inhabited rather than merely habitable, two basic requirements must be met: the planet must first be suitable and then life must emerge on it at some stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can be said about the chances of life starting up on a habitable planet? Darwin gave us a powerful explanation of how life on Earth evolved over billions of years, but he would not be drawn out on the question of how life got going in the first place. ''One might as well speculate about the origin of matter,'' he quipped. In spite of intensive research, scientists are still very much in the dark about the mechanism that transformed a nonliving chemical soup into a living cell. But without knowing the process that produced life, the odds of its happening can't be estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was a student in the 1960s, the prevailing view among scientists was that life on Earth was a freak phenomenon, the result of a sequence of chemical accidents so rare that they would be unlikely to have happened twice in the observable universe. ''Man at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of the universe, out of which he has emerged only by chance,'' wrote the biologist Jacques Monod. Today the pendulum has swung dramatically, and many distinguished scientists claim that life will almost inevitably arise in Earthlike conditions. Yet this decisive shift in view is based on little more than a hunch, rather than an improved understanding of life's origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underlying problem is complexity. Even the simplest bacterium is, at the molecular level, staggeringly complex. Although we have no idea of the minimal complexity of a living organism, it is likely to be very high. It could be that some sort of complexifying principle operates in nature, serving to drive a chaotic mix of chemicals on a fast track to a primitive microbe. If so, no hint of such a principle has been found in laboratory experiments to re-create the basic building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if life arose simply by the accumulation of many specific chemical accidents in one place, it is easy to imagine that only one in, say, a trillion trillion habitable planets would ever host such a dream run. Set against a number that big -- and once you decide a series of unlikely accidents is behind the creation of life, you get enormous odds very easily -- it is irrelevant whether the Milky Way contains 40 billion habitable planets or just a handful. Forty billion makes hardly a dent in a trillion trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we are stuck. Life may indeed pop up readily in Earthlike conditions, or it may be a fluke, unique in the observable universe. Because we are a product of this cosmic accident, we cannot conclude that Earth is typical. No statistical evidence can be drawn from a sample of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest way to settle the matter is to find a second sample of life, one that arose from scratch independent of known life. The inventory of extrasolar planets being discovered is an extremely useful first step. In the future, our telescopes should be able to analyze the atmospheres of some of these planets for telltale signs of biological activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But evidence favoring life's high probability could exist closer to home. No planet is more Earthlike than Earth itself. If life does pop up readily in Earthlike conditions, then it should have started many times, right here on our own planet. It could be that intermingled among the seething microbes all around us are some that are so biochemically different they could be descended only from a separate origin. You couldn't tell by looking, only by delving into their molecular innards and finding something weird enough to rule out a common precursor. The discovery of just a single ''alien'' microbe under our very noses would be enough to conclude that the universe was indeed teeming with life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would also address a deep philosophical question. Although the pathway from microbes to complex thinking beings like humans may still be a very difficult one, at least we know the mechanism whereby it happens -- Darwinian evolution. If microbial life is widespread in the cosmos, we can expect that, at least here and there, sentient beings will evolve. We would then be much closer to answering that age-old puzzle of existence: Are we alone in the universe?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearts were broken around the lonely cosmos in the spring when a critical wheel on NASA's Kepler spacecraft got stuck, leaving its telescope unable to point precisely enough to continue prospecting for Earthlike planets in a starry patch of the Milky Way. But Kepler's managers say they have a plan that could keep it hunting for these exoplanets for three or four more years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''K2: The story begins,'' Steve Howell, Kepler's project scientist, told a recent gathering of astronomers here at NASA's Ames Research Center, borrowing the name of the world's second-highest mountain to herald the proposed mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its four years of monitoring the brightness of each of 160,000 stars in one patch of sky, Kepler identified 3,500 possible exoplanets by seeing stars dim when planets crossed in front of them. It also enabled the first rough estimate of the abundance of habitable planets in the Milky Way: about one in five sunlike stars have potentially habitable Earth-size planets, meaning billions of chances for the existence of E.T. Not to mention how it revolutionized the understanding of the internal structures of the stars themselves through the practice of ''asteroseismology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the little spacecraft was only beginning to zero in on planets with orbits analogous to our own, Earth-size worlds that take a year to orbit suns similar to our own, candidates for Earth 2.0, in the vernacular. K2 would no longer train Kepler on only one set of stars. Instead, it would skip around the sky, monitoring the stars in one spot continuously for up to 80 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over such an interval, Kepler could not detect any planets with orbital periods more than a few weeks. But it could detect planets with habitable orbits around the smaller, dimmer stars known as red dwarfs. For such stars, the temperate orbital regions, or Goldilocks zones -- where the surface temperatures on a planet are mild enough for liquid water -- are closer and thus have shorter orbital periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are niches where we can deliver small planets,'' said Dr. Howell, noting that K2 would cover five to 10 times as much of the sky as the original Kepler survey and could discover hundreds of planets around the red dwarfs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched in March 2009 after a decades-long battle by its originator and prime scientist, William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Center, to show that planets could be detected this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its original field of view, 160,000 stars on the border of the constellations Cygnus and Lyra in the thick of the Milky Way, was chosen to a provide as large a sample as possible of sunlike stars for a cosmic census of exoplanets. To do this, Kepler had to be able to point precisely and stably enough to keep all these stars on the same pixels of its camera for four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of a second reaction wheel -- Kepler was launched with four -- left the spacecraft prone to rolling about its telescope's line of sight, especially when its solar panels, which wrap halfway around the telescope like a cape, are unevenly illuminated by sunlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, unfortunately, is the case when Kepler points at Cygnus. Light exerts pressure, which is why comets have tails. ''The sun, unfortunately, continues to shine,'' said Charles Sobeck, deputy project manager of Kepler, and the uneven solar illumination makes the spacecraft roll and unable to keep stars on the right pixels. Through all of this, the telescope and detector remained unscathed, making it a valuable astronomical resource already in space. In response to a call for ideas about how to make use of Kepler, astronomers submitted 42 white papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution was a neat bit of rocket science. Tests have shown sunlight can be used to stabilize Kepler. The key is to keep it pointed in directions that leave its solar panels evenly illuminated. ''When it's stable, it's really stable,'' Mr. Sobeck said.As a result, Kepler's planet hunting will now be limited to fields of stars that lie along a circle known as the ecliptic -- the path traversed by the sun through the zodiac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sobeck said giving up the original field of view was a big hurdle. ''After four years that was emotionally difficult.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reward will be variety, as well as a new lease on life. Part of the sun's path goes right across the center of the galaxy, in the constellation Sagittarius, and other parts, away from the Milky Way, cross outside galaxies, where Kepler could record the rise and fall of supernova explosions that have proved critical to understanding cosmic history. Other fields of opportunity include stormy regions strewn with clouds of gas and dust where new stars and presumably new planets are being born, so Kepler, if the plan goes through, will be able to study stars and planets in a variety of environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, however, K2 is only a proposal, still being tested. The idea has to pass muster with NASA's astrophysics division and then survive a review at NASA, in a sort of bake-off with other needy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final decision on Kepler's fate will come next spring. Regardless of the answer, the Kepler team will go on. The scientists have three more years of work to analyze the data that has already been obtained, including the whole last year of the spacecraft's observations, which Mr. Borucki characterized in a news conference as ''the most valuable data we have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sobeck is hopeful for more. ''Nobody wants to turn off a spacecraft in orbit,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's next mission to Mars aims to answer one question: What happened to the air that once made the surface habitable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the latest piece in the scientific exploration of whether Mars could have been, perhaps four billion years ago, a place friendly for life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer may come from a space probe known as Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or Maven for short, which is ready for the launching pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and poised to lift off Monday at 1:28 p.m. After a 10-month journey, the spacecraft is to enter orbit around Mars and spend at least a year observing Mars's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clear that major questions about the history of Mars center on the history of its climate and atmosphere, and how that's influenced the surface, the geology and on the possibility for life,'' Bruce M. Jakosky, a professor of geological sciences at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span> who is Maven's principal investigator, said at a NASA news conference last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists believe that young Mars was blanketed with a thick layer of air -- heat-trapping carbon dioxide, in particular -- that kept it warmer and wetter. Ancient channels on Mars look as if they were carved by flowing water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometime between then and now, the atmosphere went away, and Mars today is an airless, frigid desert with average surface temperatures of minus 64 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 53 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The once-bountiful air molecules must have either gone up, escaping into space, or down, transformed by chemical reactions into rock. Hydrogen, the lightest of gases, can simply float away from gravity's grasp. Heavier molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide might have been knocked out by particles and radiation streaming from the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the solar wind sweeps by, it is able to strip off the atmospheric gas,'' Dr. Jakosky said. ''It's actually stripped away, molecule by molecule, atom by atom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To figure out the puzzle of the missing atmosphere, Maven will carefully measure the wisps that remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft -- which will widen to the length of a school bus after it fans out its solar arrays -- will loop Mars in an elliptical, 4.5-hour orbit, climbing 3,860 miles above the planet then swooping down to within 93 miles of the surface. It will also make some particularly deep dips, to within 77.6 miles of the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maven's eight instruments will take stock of what is in Mars's upper atmosphere as well as catalog the solar wind particles bombarding Mars. That will allow the scientists to determine not only the rate at which the atmosphere is disappearing, but also the particulars of how it is disappearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of processes that we think may have played a role, and we don't have the measurements to understand them today,'' Dr. Jakosky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James F. Kasting, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University who is not involved with the Maven mission, said it would be useful to know how quickly Mars was losing its atmosphere today. He was less sure about what it would say about Mars in the ancient past. ''Conditions would have been, I think, very different,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young sun, for example, was about 30 percent dimmer, but emitted more ultraviolet light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Kasting also said the data could help in understanding whether distant Earth-size planets that are being discovered around other stars would be likely to have significant atmospheres. ''That's interesting for us who are interested in exo-Earths,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasts on Friday gave a 60 percent chance of favorable weather during Monday's two-hour launch window, with concerns that a cold weather front would generate clouds, strong winds and thunderstorms. If weather or technical problems keep Maven on the ground, NASA will still have three more weeks to launch it before Mars and Earth move too far out of alignment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $671 million mission was almost derailed by the federal government shutdown last month, with work halted when almost all of NASA's employees and contractors were furloughed. Within a couple of days, however, top NASA officials decided that Maven's launching fell into the category of ''essential,'' not because of an urgent need to study the Martian atmosphere but because Maven is also to serve as a communication relay for the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has two other orbiters circling Mars -- Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter -- but both are aging. If Maven does not launch this year, the next chance would be in 2016, and a less favorable configuration of orbits means that it would have to expend more fuel to get to Mars, diminishing its worth as a communication relay. At present, NASA does not have any plans for orbiters to follow Maven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Maven is back on schedule, Dr. Jakosky said, and once it completes its primary work, it should be able to stay in orbit for almost another decade. ''We're hoping for a very long mission,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, and yes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many such tantalizing and little-known details are part of an exhibition about the lives of 32 women who made major contributions in physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, computing and medicine, from the 17th century through the 20th. Some of the women are famous, many not. Nine won Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition celebrates their accomplishments, and makes it plain that they are all the more extraordinary given the deeply entrenched biases they had to overcome. There were parents who thought it improper or wasteful to educate girls; universities and professional societies that would not admit women; employers who either would not hire them or would not pay a fair wage. But there were also mentors and champions who opened doors and gave credit where it was due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition was about three years in the making, the work of three scholars of science history who collect books, manuscripts and research memorabilia: Ronald K. Smeltzer, a retired electrical engineer; Paulette Rose, a dealer in rare books; and Robert J. Ruben, a professor at the <span class="companylink">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the items on display come from their personal collections, though some were borrowed from libraries and museums. Deft biographical sketches, published in the exhibition's catalog, describe the women's scientific work and weave it into the context of their personal lives and the times in which they lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more irresistible chapters concerns Hertha Ayrton, born in Britain in 1854, who as a teenager dropped her given name, Phoebe, to adopt that of a goddess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She became an electrical engineer specializing in electric arcs and lighting systems, and published a series of papers and a textbook about them. But at a meeting of the Royal Society of London in 1902, she was not allowed to present her own work; her paper had to be read to the gathering by a man. The Royal Society also declared her ineligible for membership, and did not accept a woman until 1945.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayrton was involved in the suffragist movement, and among the treasures in the exhibit is a copy of a 1911 census form for England and Wales that was sent to her. She mailed it back blank but for her signature and a bold, elegant scrawl: ''How can I answer all these questions if I have not the intelligence to choose between two candidates for parliament? I will not supply these particulars until I have my rights as a citizen. Votes for Women.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another priceless document on display is a long, narrow, brown paper bag, the type scientists use to cover maize plants to prevent them from fertilizing the wrong partners. The exhibit catalog describes this bag as a ''manuscript,'' and indeed, it carries notes and a sketch made by the geneticist Barbara McClintock as she figured out the solution to a vexing chromosomal puzzle. Dr. McClintock won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although most people associate Florence Nightingale with nursing, she had another, wonky side. Obsessed with gathering data, she invented graphing techniques and used statistics to prove her points and push the government for health reforms. For instance, she showed that in the Crimean War in the 1850s, more British soldiers died from disease caused by poor sanitation than from war wounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sophie Kowalevski, born in Russia in 1850, became a noted mathematician in spite of a father who ''had a horror of learned women,'' according to the catalog. As a young woman, she could study math and physics only in secret. She married a man she did not love just to get away from her father and obtain a formal education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marriage turned out to be a disaster. And when the couple moved to Berlin, she had trouble finding a university that would allow a woman to earn a degree. But a renowned mathematician agreed to provide tutorials, and she eventually received a doctorate and went on to fame in her field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi, born in 1842 in London, grew up in New York and began publishing short stories at 17. But what she really wanted was to be a doctor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No medical school in New York would admit women, so she went to pharmacy school instead. Her parents were not exactly supportive: Her father offered to pay her to stay home. She forged ahead despite him, and after graduating she enrolled at a women's medical college in Pennsylvania. But she found it not rigorous enough, so she headed to Paris in hopes of studying medicine there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first the French would not let her in either. They finally relented, but made her enter the classroom by a separate door and sit alone near the professor. She graduated in 1871 and returned to New York, where she taught, did research and treated patients. She won a prize from Harvard in 1876 for a paper in which she provided scientific evidence disproving the widely held belief that menstruation impaired women's mental abilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard was less respectful to other women. Cecilia H. Payne-Gaposchkin is recognized today as a founder of modern astrophysics. But in 1923, Harvard's physics department rejected her as a graduate student because women were not allowed to be doctoral candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately she had a mentor, Harlow Shapley, the director of the Harvard College Observatory, who took her on as a student. Within two years she had published six papers and completed a doctoral thesis that a leading astronomer of the day called the most brilliant ever in the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Harvard treated her shabbily. She taught graduate courses and advised Ph.D. students, but was paid a pittance and denied a real faculty position, despite Shapley's lobbying on her behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was not made a professor until 1956, when she also became head of the astronomy department -- the first chairwoman of any department at Harvard.</p>

It mostly burned up in the process, according to United States tracking data; whatever debris survived most likely fell into the ocean just off the tip of South America, the BBC reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, spent satellites haphazardly returning to Earth constitute a worrisome trend, with more than 100 tons of debris expected to fall from the sky this year alone.</p>

But such devastating events are more likely to occur once every decade or two, according to two papers in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings have helped revive talk of planetary defense efforts, such as the creation of an International Asteroid Warning Network, or launching an asteroid-seeking telescope into space.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a short, narrow snout, sharp teeth and forward-slanting eyes, Lythronax was well suited to hunting.

Just the discovery of microbes on a distant planet would be ''like putting Copernicus and Darwin into the same bottle and giving it a good shake,'' says Matt Mountain, director of NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stakes in the planet-hunting game are more than just intellectual, as Lee Billings, a freelance journalist, points out in ''Five Billion Years of Solitude,'' his graceful new book on the history, meaning and personalities behind the search for life among the stars. ''Life on this planet has an expiration date,'' he writes, ''if for no other reason than that someday the Sun will cease to shine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we, or our successors, may need somewhere to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 20 years, the field of exoplanets -- the planets outside our solar system -- has become the fastest growing branch of astronomy. NASA's Kepler spacecraft alone has identified some 3,500 potential planets in a small patch of the Milky Way, and astronomers have concluded that there are roughly as many planets in the galaxy as stars, that is to say, billions. Some of them, presumably, must be like home. Happy hunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The field is hotly competitive and ''Goldilocks'' planets that might or might not be habitable -- or even exist at all -- have danced in and out of the news in recent years. Our putative twin remains missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings sketches this history ably, though he is light on the exploits of Kepler, which has driven the news of late. His main interest is less in chasing Goldilocks planets than in exploring the deeper issues involved, including just how hard it will be to learn anything about these planets once we find them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth, for example, is 4.6 billion years old, but animal life has been around for only half a billion years, and oxygen has only been abundant in the atmosphere for two billion years or so and, of course, intelligent life only a sliver of that time. If we found an analogue of Earth circa three billion years ago, would we even recognize it as a promising place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book's title, Billings says, is a reference to the expected longevity of life on Earth, but his account is less about exoplanets than about the people who make the search for them their lives' cause -- ''creatures that, before their sun went dim, might somehow touch the stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We meet luminaries like Frank Drake, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who pioneered the search for radio signals from extraterrestrials more than 50 years ago. Drake is now worried that Earth's own detectability in this regard has declined with the advent of digital television, a worrisome omen if this is the trend of advanced civilizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reading this book is like peering over Billings's shoulder. He doesn't just interview astronomers and geophysicists; he and his subjects ponder the history of the universe over margaritas and one-dollar tacos. They tromp through redwood forests, talking, talking, talking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes they even do some science, or at least try. During a trip to Lick Observatory in Northern California to watch Venus crossing the Sun, the computer controlling one astronomer's telescope goes berserk and he misses the crucial moment when sunlight shining past the edge of Venus can delineate the planet's atmosphere, a feat astronomers want to accomplish with exoplanets. Venus won't be transiting again until 2117.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story may meander at times, but this is the best book I have read about exoplanets, and one of the few whose language approaches the grandeur of a quest that is practically as old as our genes. Billings's description of the history of the Marcellus shale, the subject of a national debate about fracking, is worth the price of the book by itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.5 billion years of ''deep time'' revealed by Earth's geological record inspires Billings to pull out all the rhetorical stops. About the geologists who have uncovered it, he writes, ''The sight of a fossilized form, perhaps the outline of a trilobite, a leaf or a saurian footfall can still send a shiver through their bones, or excavate a trembling hollow in the chest that breath cannot fill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He goes on: ''A planet becomes a vast machine, or an organism, pursuing some impenetrable purpose through its continental collisions and volcanic outpourings. A man becomes a protein-sheathed splash of ocean raised from rock to breathe the sky, an eater of sun whose atoms were forged on an anvil of stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is both good and bad news here. The good news, Billings reports, is that even if we burn up all the fossil fuel, we are unlikely to tip Earth into ''a runaway-­greenhouse world'' as one scientist described Venus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news is the planet is going to become uninhabitable anyway. Long before the Sun burns out, Earth's core will cool off and volcanoes, which restore the atmosphere, will cease. The amount of carbon dioxide will fall to levels too low to support photosynthesis in half a billion years or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complex life arose here only half a billion years ago, notes James Kasting, a geosciences professor at Penn State, who concludes glumly that intelligence might exist for only one-tenth of Earth's history, cutting the odds of its being detected elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the discovery of Earth 2.0 will mark only the beginning of the real work. Figuring out whether its atmosphere is conducive to life -- or perhaps even indicative of life -- could take years and billions of dollars, and the immediate prospects are discouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for an ambitious NASA project known as the Terrestrial Planet Finder, which has the power to inspect distant planets, have collapsed, partly because astronomers could not agree on which of several challenging technologies to adopt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the book, Billings introduces us to Sara Seager, a rising young M.I.T. planetary astronomer, who organized a small exoplanet conference in 2011 to discuss where the field is headed and to announce to her colleagues that she was going to be working in the ''commercial spaceflight industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings describes in much detail Seager's canoe trip to Canada's Northwest Territories, the so-called Barren Lands, the summer before graduate school. She made the journey with her friend Mike Wevrick. Together, ''they portaged over the roots of tall mountains transformed to gentle nubs by four billion years of weathering.'' By the end of the trip, ''she realized she had not only fallen in love with remote desolation; she had fallen in love with Wevrick, too.'' This is only the beginning of a heartbreaking story I won't spoil by telling here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What, you might wonder, does this journey have to do with exoplanets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has nothing to do with exoplanets. But it has everything to do with the passion and determination and resourcefulness of scientists like Sara Seager, those creatures who would touch the stars.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European satellite that mapped Earth's gravitational field in exquisite detail will be pulled down by gravity to its fiery destruction sometime in the next few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where and when it will crash no one knows. It could be almost anywhere on the globe. About 25 to 45 fragments of the one-ton spacecraft are expected to survive all the way to the surface, with the largest perhaps weighing 200 pounds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest in a parade of spacecraft falling from the sky in what are worryingly called ''uncontrolled entries.'' About 100 tons of debris will fall from the sky this year alone. There are, however, no known instances in which anyone has been injured by space debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's rather hard to predict where the spacecraft will re-enter and impact,'' said Rune Floberghagen, the mission manager for the European Space Agency's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE. ''Concretely our best engineering prediction is now for a re-entry on Sunday, with a possibility for it slipping into early Monday.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOCE (pronounced GO-chay) ran out of propellant last month and has been dropping about 2.5 miles a day. As of Wednesday, it was still 113 miles up as it circled the Earth once every 88 minutes. Its orbit goes almost directly over the poles, and as the planet rotates, almost all places on Earth pass beneath it at some point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, NASA's decommissioned Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, tumbling out of control, worried people around the world until it splashed harmlessly in the Pacific. Later that year, the Russian spacecraft Phobos-Grunt launched into orbit, but then malfunctioned. Instead of heading toward Mars, it crashed back to Earth a couple of months later, again falling in the Pacific without incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances that a chunk of GOCE or any other space debris will injure anyone are tiny, but not zero. Dr. Floberghagen said the debris will endanger about 15 to 20 square yards of the Earth's surface. ''If you compare that to the surface of the planet, it's a very small number,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An uncontrolled re-entry was always the planned fate for GOCE, which was launched in March 2009. Unlike most spacecraft, which use thrusters to adjust their orbits, it has a highly efficient propulsion system called an ion engine. Unlike thrusters, the engine can fire continuously to offset atmospheric drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That allowed GOCE, with its sleek, airplanelike shape, to maintain a low orbit, just 160 miles up and later 140 miles. From that perch, it made gravity measurements that were much more accurate and detailed than previous ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can actually map, see geology, in the gravity map,'' Dr. Floberghagen said. ''This is something that is quite unique, actually.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, by combining GOCE's gravity measurements of the surfaces of oceans with altitude measurements from other spacecraft, scientists have created global maps of ocean currents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data will also help scientists study ice sheets and convection in the Earth's mantle, and help oil companies figure out where to drill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the ion engine was able to keep the spacecraft aloft, its thrust was far too weak -- ''More or less equal to what you normally exert on a piece of paper when you exhale,'' Dr. Floberghagen said -- to push the spacecraft to a trajectory that would assure it of ending up in an empty stretch of ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its propellant tank empty, it is now guided by gravity and air friction. ''Quite literally GOCE is now nearly flying like an airplane without an engine, with the upper layer of the atmosphere providing aerodynamic stabilization,'' Dr. Floberghagen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it descends into thicker air, the atmospheric drag will increase sharply, and its fall is expected to accelerate in a final plunge sometime between Saturday and Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day before re-entry, mission managers will be able to narrow the time of the crash within three orbits, Dr. Floberghagen said. GOCE's instruments continue to operate, providing scientists with detailed data about its final plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the United Nations adopted guidelines to reduce the dangers caused by space debris. By then, GOCE had already been designed, but a future mission like it might have additional thrusters for a safer ending.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in February, shattering windows for miles and injuring well over 1,000 people, experts said it was a rare event -- of a magnitude that might occur only once every 100 to 200 years, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now a team of scientists is suggesting that the Earth is vulnerable to many more Chelyabinsk-size space rocks than was previously thought. In research being published Wednesday by the journal Nature, they estimate that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect ''really makes a lot of people uncomfortable,'' said Peter G. Brown, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Western Ontario and an author of the two studies in Nature. A third paper by other scientists describing the Chelyabinsk explosion was published online this week by the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings are helping to elevate the topic of planetary defense -- identifying dangerous asteroids and deflecting them if necessary -- from Hollywood fantasy to real-world concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A United Nations committee has been studying the issue for some time, and next month the General Assembly is expected to adopt two of its recommendations: establishing an International Asteroid Warning Network for countries to share information; and calling on the world's space agencies to set up an advisory group to explore technologies for deflecting an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sky surveys have spotted about 95 percent of the big near-Earth asteroids, those that are at least one kilometer wide, or 0.6 miles, and none are in danger of hitting Earth anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those are not the only ones to worry about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One kilometer is more than just dangerous,'' said Edward T. Lu, a former NASA space shuttle astronaut who heads the <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span>, a private effort to launch a space telescope that could find smaller asteroids. ''One kilometer is end-of-human-civilization kind of dangerous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelyabinsk asteroid was just 60 feet wide. Speeding around 40,000 miles per hour, it released energy equal to 500,000 tons of TNT. A larger asteroid, perhaps two or three times the diameter of the Chelyabinsk one, exploded over Siberia in 1908 and is estimated to have released energy equivalent to 5 million to 15 million tons of TNT, flattening millions of trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed B612 telescope, to be called Sentinel, is intended to find asteroids about 450 feet wide, although it will also find many that are smaller. Dr. Lu said the mission would cost $450 million -- $250 million to build the spacecraft and $200 million to operate it for a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 450-foot-wide asteroid, Dr. Lu said, would be equivalent to 150 million tons of TNT. ''You're not going to wipe out humanity,'' he said, ''but if you get unlucky, you could kill 50 million people or you could collapse the world economy for a century, two centuries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu said astronomers had found only 10 to 20 percent of the near-Earth asteroids of that size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sentinel would also spot many smaller ones that could still be devastating. ''What we've been talking about are the ones that would only destroy a major metropolitan area -- all of New York City and the surrounding area,'' Dr. Lu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said only about 0.5 percent of these smaller asteroids, roughly the size of the 1908 one, have been found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because telescope surveys have counted so few of the small asteroids, Dr. Brown and his colleagues instead investigated what has actually hit the Earth. In one of the articles in Nature, they examined <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> data from the 1960s and 1970s and later data from sensors verifying a ban on aboveground nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recordings captured the low-frequency atmospheric rumblings generated by about 60 asteroid explosions. Most came from small asteroids, but their data suggested that the somewhat larger ones hit more frequently than would be expected based on the estimates from sky surveys. That could mean the Earth has been unlucky recently, or that the estimates on the number of Chelyabinsk-size asteroids are too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any one of them individually I think you could dismiss,'' Dr. Brown said, ''but when you take it all together, I think the preponderance of the evidence is there is a much higher number of these tens-of-meters-size objects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu said that was one more reason to launch an asteroid-finding telescope. ''There are hints the rate is higher than we think, but we don't really know yet, and I think we should find out,'' he said. ''When you find out how many there are, you also find out where the individual ones are. Everything you discover you can either rule out as going to hit us or you say, 'Hey, we ought to look at this one more carefully.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the Chelyabinsk-size asteroids would elude detection by Sentinel. Still, the residents of Chelyabinsk would have benefited from a warning on the morning of Feb. 15 to stay away from the window. With a $5 million grant from NASA, University of Hawaii astronomers are setting up telescopes to scan the sky for quick-moving spots of light that could be oncoming asteroids. There would be no opportunity to deflect the asteroid that would hit in days or weeks, but it would give time to warn, and to evacuate. That system is scheduled to go into operation in 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch is only the first step, however, in a perilous 300-day journey that has ended in failure for about a third of all previous efforts. Only the United States, Russia and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> have reached Mars, and none of them managed it on the first try.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because India's attempts to develop a more powerful launcher had failed, the spacecraft could not be sent directly on its way. Instead, it will have to orbit Earth for nearly a month as a series of small bursts by its thrusters slowly nudges it into space. If all goes well, it will reach Mars on Sept. 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a cost of $72 million, the Mars project is relatively inexpensive, but that has not stopped critics from raising questions about why the government is pouring money into space programs when India has so many pressing social, educational and infrastructure needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prominent scholar and activist, Jean Drèze, told India Today that the Mars mission ''seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those concerns were not widely shared by India's leaders. In the heat of an election campaign, both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi, the candidate for prime minister from the main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, were quick to congratulate the scientists on their initial success. ''India has once again established itself in the world,'' Mr. Modi said. ''I congratulate the scientists and technicians behind the mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian officials also defended the program as yielding technological advances that are hard to predict, claims that critics were quick to dismiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G. Madhavan Nair, a former head of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span>, told The Indian Express this year that ''instead of concentrating on practical missions, we are spending money to prove nothing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone has made some statement that the Mars mission will prove new technologies,'' he said, but added that ''as a person familiar with these technologies, I believe that there is no new technology involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program is not only a source of nationalist pride but also a weapon in India's competition with China. Shortly after the failure of a Chinese mission to Mars in 2011, Mr. Singh, addressing the nation on India's Independence Day, announced the plans for an Indian attempt. ''This spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's Mars venture was preceded by a similar mission that placed a spacecraft, Chandrayaan-1, in orbit around the moon in 2008. The moon mission followed a similar effort by China, and officials were blunt about their intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''China has gone earlier, but today we are trying to catch them, catch that gap, bridge the gap,'' Bhaskar Narayan, a director at the Indian space agency, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the spacecraft nears Mars, it will be maneuvered into a low orbit to assay the Martian atmosphere, looking in particular for the presence of methane, a possible indicator of the existence of life processes at some point in the planet's history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest size of the payload, at 33 pounds, is an indicator of the limitations of the mission. But repeated failures in the development of a rocket capable of carrying payloads of more than two tons had led to delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. K. Das, a former member of the Space Commission, which sets Indian space policy, said Tuesday that ''we should see this as a technical exercise,'' though he conceded that a more powerful rocket could have made for a more direct and less complex journey to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a long journey, and we can only understand the challenges and the problems by attempting it,'' he added. ''The first stage has been flawless.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe known odds of something -- or someone -- living far, far away from Earth improved beyond astronomers' boldest dreams on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reported that there could be as many as 40 billion habitable Earth-size planets in the galaxy, based on a new analysis of data from NASA's Kepler spacecraft.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One out of every five sunlike stars in the galaxy has a planet the size of Earth circling it in the Goldilocks zone -- not too hot, not too cold -- where surface temperatures should be compatible with liquid water, according to a herculean three-year calculation based on data from the Kepler spacecraft by Erik Petigura, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petigura's analysis represents a major step toward the main goal of the Kepler mission, which was to measure what fraction of sunlike stars in the galaxy have Earth-size planets. Sometimes called eta-Earth, it is an important factor in the so-called Drake equation used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe. Mr. Petigura's paper, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span>, puts another smiley face on a cosmos that has gotten increasingly friendly and fecund-looking over the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems that the universe produces plentiful real estate for life that somehow resembles life on Earth,'' Mr. Petigura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last two decades, astronomers have logged more than 1,000 planets around other stars, so-called exoplanets, and Kepler, in its four years of life before being derailed by a mechanical pointing malfunction last winter, has compiled a list of some 3,500 more candidates. The new result could steer plans in the next few years and decades to find a twin of the Earth -- Earth 2.0, in the argot -- that is close enough to here to study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearest such planet might be only 12 light-years away. ''Such a star would be visible to the naked eye,'' Mr. Petigura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His result builds on a report earlier this year by David Charbonneau and Courtney Dressing of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, who found that about 15 percent of the smaller and more numerous stars known as red dwarfs have Earth-like planets in their habitable zones. Using slightly less conservative assumptions, Ravi Kopparapu of Pennsylvania State University found that half of all red dwarfs have such planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Galaxy contains billions of potentially habitable planets, say University of California at Berkeley and University of Hawaii at Manoa astronomers. Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, who supervised Mr. Petigura's research and was a co-author of the paper along with Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii, said: ''This is the most important work I've ever been involved with. This is it. Are there inhabitable Earths out there?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm feeling a little tingly,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference Friday discussing the results, astronomers erupted in praise of the Kepler mission and its team. Natalie Batalha, a Kepler leader from the NASA Ames Research Center, described the project and its members as ''the best of humanity rising to the occasion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Petigura's new calculation, the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is 22 percent, plus or minus 8 percent, depending on exactly how you define the habitable zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several caveats. Although these planets are Earth-size, nobody knows what their masses are and thus whether they are rocky like the Earth, or balls of ice or gas, let alone whether anything can, or does -- or ever will -- live on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to believe, from recent observations of other worlds, however, that at least some Earth-size planets, if not all of them, are indeed rocky. Last week, two groups of astronomers announced that an Earth-size planet named Kepler 78b that orbits its sun in 8.5 hours has the same density as the Earth, though it is too hot to support life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nature,'' as Mr. Petigura put it, ''knows how to make rocky Earth-size planets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the number is more uncertain than it might have been because Kepler's pointing system failed before it could complete its prime survey. As a result, Mr. Petigura and his colleagues had to extrapolate from planets slightly larger than Earth and with slightly smaller, tighter orbits. For the purposes of his analysis ''Earth-size'' was anything from one to two times the diameter of the Earth, and Earth-like orbits were between 400 and 200 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Batalha said, ''We don't yet have any planet candidates that are exact analogues of the Earth in terms of size, orbit or star type.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Kepler itself is sidelined while astronomers devise a new program it can accomplish with less flexible pointing ability, it has sent back so much data that there is still a whole year's worth of results left to analyze, Dr. Batalha said. ''Scientists,'' she said, ''are going to work on Kepler data for decades.'' Kepler was launched in 2009 to perform a kind of cosmic census, monitoring the brightness of 150,000 far-off stars in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations, looking for dips in brightness when planets pass in front of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petigura and his colleagues restricted themselves to a subset of some 42,000 brighter and well-behaved stars. They found 603 planets, of which 10 were between one Earth and two Earths in diameter, and circled in what Mr. Petigura defined as the habitable zone, where they would receive between a quarter of the light the Earth gets, and four times as much. In the solar system, that zone would spread from inside the orbit of Venus to just outside the orbit of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in an innovation borrowed from other data-intensive fields like particle physics, Mr. Petigura designed a computer pipeline so that he could inject fake planets into the data -- 40,000 in all -- and see how efficiently his program could detect planets of different sizes and orbits. In addition to that correction, he and his colleagues had to correct for geometry; only about one in 100 planet systems is aligned edge-on so that earthlings would see the telltale wink of an exoplanet transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a ton of work,'' he recalled, explaining that he had to try out tens of billions of different periods for each star in order to find planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, an exoplanet astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not involved in the work, said the pipeline testing had made the results believable. ''I would say that small planets are everywhere and very common,'' she said, ''no matter how you slice and dice the data. But Kepler is dead and we have no way to get any further data. So we'll have to be satisfied with this as the final word, for now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers described it on Wednesday as the first Earth-size planet that seems to be made of the same mixture of rock and iron as Earth, and that orbits a star similar to our sun.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler 78b would not be a pleasant place to visit. It whirls around its parent star, Kepler 78, at a distance of less than a million miles, and its year -- the time it takes to complete one orbit -- is just eight and a half hours. (By contrast, Earth is 93 million miles from the sun and, of course, completes its yearly orbit in a little over 365 days.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that close proximity, the surface of Kepler 78b is infernally hot: 3,500 to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, or ''well above the temperature where rock melts,'' said Andrew W. Howard, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii and the lead author of one of two papers being published in the journal Nature. ''This is probably one of the most hellish planets that have been discovered yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewed from the surface of Kepler 78b, its star would cover 80 times more of the sky than the sun does in Earth's sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly not a habitable planet,'' said Francesco Pepe, a professor of astronomy at the University of Geneva and the lead author of the other Nature paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 78b is the newest addition to the pantheon of oddball planets in the Milky Way. The first planet discovered around another sunlike star turned out to be about the size of Jupiter, but orbiting its star at what seemed to be an impossibly close orbit. Other discoveries over the years include a fluffy planet with a density less than that of cork and a planet blacker than coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Exoplanets are just surprising us with their diversity,'' said Dimitar D. Sasselov, a professor of astronomy at Harvard and a member of Dr. Pepe's team, using the name for planets outside our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 78b is one of more than 150 planets spotted by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which noted the dimming of the starlight when a planet passed in front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those findings were published in August. But while Kepler can determine exoplanets' size and orbit, it cannot measure their mass. For that, two teams of astronomers looked at Kepler 78b star from Earth. Dr. Howard's team used the Keck 1 telescope in Hawaii; Dr. Pepe's team used a telescope in the Canary Islands. They could not directly see the planet, but they could spot undulations in the frequency of light from the star caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The heavier the planet, the larger the swings in frequency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teams coordinated their work, agreeing to publish their results at the same time, but they did not collaborate. They decided that they would not exchange their data and answers until their papers were almost complete so that each would serve as an independent check on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the two teams came up with nearly identical answers. The density of Kepler 78b is 0.2 pounds per cubic inch, the same as Earth's, suggesting that the two planets' makeup is very similar -- an iron core with rocky, if melted, outer layers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the first really well measured Earthlike composition for a rocky extrasolar planet,'' said L. Drake Deming, a professor of astronomy at the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> who was not a member of either team but wrote an accompanying commentary for Nature. That astronomers have already found an Earthlike planet suggests that there should be others in cooler, more life-friendly orbits. ''You can reasonably conclude from that that it's not rare, because you've found it pretty easily,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That still leaves a mystery: how Kepler 78b got where it is. ''Right now, we have no clue,'' Dr. Sasselov said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could not have formed there, because the star as a youngster would have extended into its orbit. A near-miss with another planet could have flung it toward the star, but in that case its orbit would have been elliptical, not circular. Or it was nudged inward by the material that formed the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is that it was originally a gas giant like Saturn and that as the planet spiraled in toward the star, all of the gases were stripped away, leaving just the rocky core at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, this scenario doesn't work, either,'' Dr. Sasselov said. ''If you want me to choose out of four bad ones, that's probably the one which seems least so.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former <span class="companylink">Homestake Gold</span> Mine in Lead, S.D., has a hallowed place in the history of physics as a spot where nothing happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was there, in the 1970s, that Raymond Davis Jr. attempted to catch neutrinos, spooky subatomic particles emitted by the sun, in a vat of cleaning fluid a mile underground and for a long time came up empty. For revolutionizing the study of those particles, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, an international team of physicists based in the same cavern of the former mine announced a new milestone of frustration, but also hope -- this time in the search for dark matter, the mysterious, invisible ingredient that astronomers say makes up a quarter of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first three months of running the biggest, most sensitive dark matter detector yet -- a vat of 368 kilograms of liquid xenon cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit -- the researchers said they had not seen a trace of the clouds of particles that theorists say should be wafting through space, the galaxy, the Earth and, of course, ourselves, knocking out at least one controversial class of dark matter candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the experiment has just begun and will run for all of next year. The detector, already twice as sensitive as the next best one, will gain another factor of sensitivity in the coming run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just because we don't see anything in the first run doesn't mean we won't see anything in the second,'' said Richard Gaitskell, a professor of physics at <span class="companylink">Brown University</span> and a spokesman for an international collaboration that operates the experiment known as LUX, for the Large Underground Xenon dark matter experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As has become de rigueur for such occasions, the scientists took pride and hope in how clearly they did not see anything. ''In 25 years of searching, this is the cleanest signal I've ever seen,'' Dr. Gaitskell said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That meant, the scientists said, that their detector was working so well that they would easily see a dark matter particle if and when it decided to drop by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, they had support from outside scientists. Neal Weiner, a particle theorist at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, called the results impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have not found dark matter,'' he said. ''There is nothing smacking you in the face to make you think there is something there.'' But as the sensitivity of the detector increases, he added, ''If there is anything in there, it should become apparent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement at the Homestake site capped a morning of ceremony, which included Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota and members of the State Legislature, at what amounted to a coming-out party for LUX and for the Sanford Underground Research Facility, a lab being developed in the old mine with a mix of state and private money, as well as support from the Energy Department. The lab is named after the philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, who donated $70 million to get it going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LUX is the latest in a long series of ever-larger experiments that have occupied and taunted the world's physicists over the last few years. They are all in abandoned mines or other underground places to shield them from cosmic rays, which could cause false alarms. Daniel McKinsey, an associate professor of physics at Yale and a spokesman for the LUX group, said in an interview that the biggest source of noise in the LUX device was trace radioactivity in the detector itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger instruments are already on the drawing boards of LUX and other collaborations, but physicists say the experiments are already sensitive enough to test some versions of dark matter that have been proposed, including the idea that dark particles interact with ordinary matter by exchanging the recently discovered Higgs boson. Dr. Weiner said he held his breath every time new results from a dark matter experiment were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter has teased and tantalized physicists since the 1970s, when it was demonstrated that some invisible material must be providing the gravitational glue to hold galaxies together. Determining what it is would provide insight into particles and forces not described by the Standard Model that now rules physics, not to mention a slew of Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists' best guess is that this dark matter consists of clouds of exotic subatomic particles left over from the Big Bang and known generically as WIMPs, for weakly interacting massive particles, which would weigh several hundred times as much as a proton but could nevertheless pass through the Earth like smoke through a screen door. They are a generic feature of a much-hyped idea known as supersymmetry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particle physicists have been hoping to produce these particles or other evidence of supersymmetry in the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva or to read their signature in cosmic rays from outer space. No one has ever claimed to have seen such a heavy WIMP, in space or underground, but another experiment in another mine, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, claims to have recorded three events that could have been low-mass dark matter particles, only a few times heavier than a proton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new results from the Homestake mine, if they are correct, would rule out those low-mass particles. Dr. Gaitskell explained that if those particles were real, the Homestake detector would have recorded 1,550 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there are 1,550 of them, boy are we going to see them,'' he said in a presentation at the Homestake facility on Wednesday. ''We do not see the low-mass WIMPS.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But afterward, Juan I. Collar, a dark matter specialist at the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> who has been urging the community to take low-mass WIMPs seriously, questioned whether the LUX detector had been adequately calibrated to detect them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They do have a real interest in performing those calibrations, because they would settle the issue,'' Dr. Collar said in an email. ''We just have to be patient. At the end they promised to do so, and I have no doubts they will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, a quarter of the universe is still missing in action.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new space tourism company named World View unveiled its plans on Tuesday to loft passengers to the stratosphere as early as 2015, not by rocket but by giant balloon. Price: $75,000. (Drinks included.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World View is led by the same people involved in Inspiration Mars, a private endeavor to launch two people in 2018 to a flyby of the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very gentle flight that will last for hours aloft,'' said Jane Poynter, World View's chief executive. She said the cabin would be about the size of that of a private jet, and would have a ''superbly comfortable, luxurious interior where you can get up and stand upright and move around and go back to the bar and get a drink.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, space tourism companies like Virgin Galactic and <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> have sold hundreds of tickets for suborbital rocket trips, with the first paying passengers scheduled to get their rides as early as next year. But the rockets are essentially big roller-coaster rides, with the exciting portion at the top of the arc lasting just a few minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, World View's balloon and capsule, with six passengers and two crew members, would take about an hour and a half to reach altitude and then drift for a couple of hours before the balloon was jettisoned and the capsule would glide back to Earth beneath an inflated parasail. ''We really think there is a market for being able to contemplate the view,'' said Taber MacCallum, the company's chief technology officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World View's trips would be less expensive than the rocket rides: Virgin Galactic charges $250,000 and XCOR $95,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principal shortcoming: you would not actually get to space, nor would you get to call yourself an astronaut afterward. The balloon would rise about 18.5 miles, not quite a third of the way to the 62-mile altitude that is considered the beginning of outer space. But it is high enough to view the planet's curvature and for the sky to darken from blue to black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip would be more like that of Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil who last year leapt from a balloon at an altitude of more than 24 miles, but with more comfort and a less exhilarating return to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We promise we won't open the door and have you jump back to Earth,'' Ms. Poynter joked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the World View capsule will not reach space, the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span> will regulate it as a commercial space venture, because the capsule is built to operate in space conditions. World View's application to the F.A.A. noted that at an altitude of 20 miles, water and blood boil at a much lower temperature and decompression would be fatal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching sites have not yet been chosen. Test flights carrying scientific payloads could lift off sooner. Scientists have used balloons, small rockets, and even gliders to study the region. The nascent commercial space companies like World View could offer more opportunities for scientists at a lower cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wife-and-husband team of Ms. Poynter and Mr. MacCallum previously founded Paragon Space Development Company, the technology firm that is working with Dennis Tito, the entrepreneur who is leading the Inspiration Mars effort. Paragon will also develop World View's capsule, but the two are separate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in the venture include Philippe Bourguignon, a former president of Euro Disney and current chief executive of Miraval resorts, Ms. Poynter said.</p>

Higgs of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and François Englert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium for their theory, first put forth in 1964, that there is a particle that confers mass to other particles.

Last Tuesday, scientists at a meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span> announced that they had relocated it.

It was first described in 1953, but for many years nobody saw one and it was presumed extinct. Then some bird-watchers photographed one in 2005. Now scientists have had a close look at it in the flesh. The lizard, named for the male's prodigious nose, hides by day high in the trees. But at night it rests, a pale shade of white, at the ends of branches. A team of National Geographic researchers found one, held it until daylight to photograph it, and let it go.</p>

His five-hour journey in the Aurora 7 capsule in 1962 ended with a splashdown almost 300 miles from the nearest recovery ship. Mr. Carpenter, who never flew in space again, became involved in environmental research, and in 1965 spent a month living in an experimental underwater habitat. His death leaves John H.

Juno was moving along at 78,000 miles an hour as it flew out to the asteroid belt and back toward Earth, but the flyby will speed it up to 87,000 miles an hour, a velocity that will bring the 8,000-pound probe to Jupiter around July 2016.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the partial government shutdown reached its 11th day on Friday, it was affecting far more than the nation's monuments and parks, with much of the little-noticed machinery of government shifted to idle. Jobs deemed essential continued to be performed, but other tasks that have paused may take a lasting toll, even if President Obama and Congressional Republicans reach an agreement to end the shutdown soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temporary disruption of furloughed workers' spending patterns, a skittishness likely to continue even after they go back to work, is capable of measurable damage to the nation's growth rate, economists said. Federal workers are ''spooked'' and are likely to save more and spend less, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''They're going to be cautious at least into the next year,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Anderson, a furloughed worker for the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> in West Virginia, said, ''I live from paycheck to paycheck just like every other American does.'' Mr. Anderson, who earns $62,000 a year overseeing building maintenance, is worried that his credit rating will fall because he cannot pay bills this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got to tell you, this is messing me up,'' he said. ''It's going to take me a year once we go back to work to get squared away because of not getting my salary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Institutes of Health</span>, the largest financial supporter of medical research in the world, has ground to a halt during the peak of its grant-making season, suspending millions of dollars in new research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's Antarctic program has been suspended, ejecting some of the world's leading scientists from their lodgings at the South Pole, where they collect data crucial for understanding climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agencies, like the E.P.A., have been virtually shuttered. Almost 95 percent of the agency's 16,000 workers have been told to stay home. And while some longtime opponents of environmental regulation cheer that temporary outcome, others are deploring what could be lasting impacts on the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a polluter's heyday,'' said Sara Chieffo, the legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters. Normally, she said, ''they are doing the inspections that need to be done, making sure that polluters are held to account.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know that the longer this goes on, the cascading effects occur,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Ronnenberg, who is on a furlough along with thousands of other safety inspectors for the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, said tasks not being performed included inspections of the de-icing of aircraft on the tarmac and checks that pilots do not fly longer than allowed. He said the risks to flight safety increase the longer outside inspectors were off duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shutdown initially sent about 800,000 workers home on Oct 1. The Defense Department recalled most of its 350,000 civilian work force, and others who are deemed essential have returned piecemeal, like thousands of C.I.A. employees and experts at the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> needed to confront a salmonella outbreak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agreements were reached between the federal government and states to reopen a number of national parks and monuments, including the Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon National Park, Mount Rushmore and parks in Utah and Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shutdown has left close to 500,000 employees still on furlough, according to the <span class="companylink">American Federation of Government Employees</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House passed a bill to assure that they receive back pay, which the White House supports. Even if workers are financially made whole, their uncertainty about whether another shutdown could occur was giving many pause about making big purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Sailes, a mechanic at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, and his wife have put off buying a house for a year. ''We've got to sit in our apartment until we get some more money,'' he said. ''We had to push everything back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The furlough comes on top of the all-agency spending cuts earlier this year known as sequestration, which forced some workers to take unpaid leave and departments to cut budgets. Republicans applauded reducing the size of the government, but some economists calculated that the cuts have slowed the nation's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists said that one of the most serious casualties might be the country's reputation. Markus Kissler-Patig, the director of the Gemini Observatory, an international coalition with telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, said he was worried about the United States' foreign partners if the coalition's cash flow, which is administered by the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span>, were to run out. The foundation, which is almost entirely furloughed, cannot provide cash infusions during the shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am starting to hear informal feedback questioning whether the N.S.F. is the right agency to run this international observatory,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor could the timing have been worse for the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8 billion contraption that unfolds like an origami figure in space and will be capable of detecting the universe's earliest galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have toiled for years and were poised to put its inner workings to the test by simulating the vacuum of outer space in a structure the size of a grain silo when the shutdown halted work at the NASA-run facility in suburban Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just sitting there twiddling its thumbs,'' said Matt Mountain, the director of NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also suspended was work at the South Pole, which involves collecting information critical to studying climate change and can be done only a few months a year. ''In my whole career, this is the most frustrating thing I've ever seen,'' said Ross Powell, a geologist who has been going to the South Pole since the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the E.P.A., officials have allowed about 900 employees to stay on the job, responding to imminent threats to the environment or to public health. Workers are reporting for duty at toxic waste sites that pose a direct threat to surrounding communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials said the bulk of the agency's work had been suspended. Industrial chemicals are not being screened for potential health effects. Routine inspections of drinking water systems across the country have been halted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the agency's critics say the work stoppages are proof of what they have contended for years: that the agency's efforts to issue environmental rules reach too far into American life and should be curtailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is some good news out of the shutdown,'' Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. ''The E.P.A. can't issue new regulations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But supporters of the agency said the shutdown had affected critical tasks related to keeping the nation's air and water clean. Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said he hoped the shutdown would end soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The partial government shutdown has delayed investigations and ongoing scientific studies at the agency,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the E.P.A.'s shutdown has also created economic effects as the agency has stopped certifying certain products that enter the country for sale. Among those is millions of dollars' worth of chemicals used to make pesticides. They are stuck in customs because E.P.A. field workers are not available to review and approve them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the nation's ports, some cars and trucks are stuck in limbo because there are no E.P.A. inspectors to certify the emissions stickers that are put on the windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anne Lucas, a chemist for the Food and Drug Administration in Maryland who has been on furlough, said she was not worried about her finances but was unhappy to be idle so long. ''We all just want to get back to work,'' she said. ''Most federal workers are not there for the money, they're there for the service.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has been volunteering at a nature center, where she is assigned to pick up trash, a task she said was preferable to doing nothing. ''Just because I have a Ph.D. doesn't mean I'm too good to pick up trash,'' she said.</p>

But the phenomenon that sets the plot in motion is not a Hollywood fantasy. It is space junk, a very real villain. While Mr. Clooney and Ms. Bullock are out completing repairs, they hear that a Russian missile strike on a satellite has caused a chain reaction, with the debris taking out other satellites, and that flying bits of metal are coming their way. They survive the initial collision, but the junk ruins their shuttle.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perils of debris in space has long been recognized. In 1978, Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais published ''Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt,'' in which they explained, ''Satellite collisions will produce a number of fragments, some of which may be capable of fragmenting another satellite upon collision, creating even more fragments.'' Over time, the junk could impede future missions. As the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson noted on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, ''The film #Gravity depicts a scenario of catastrophic satellite destruction that can actually happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it has yet to take down a shuttle, space junk has caused real damage. Earlier this year, a Russian communications satellite was destroyed by debris from a Chinese antisatellite missile test in 2007. In 2009, an American communications satellite hit a Russian satellite 490 miles above Siberia, sending hundreds of fragments into space. Foreshadowing ''Gravity,'' a Times editorial warned of risks to the international space station, ''orbiting 215 miles up with three astronauts aboard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's space agencies have been seeking ways to reduce the growth of orbital debris. But so far, there's no agreed upon technique to remove what's already there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news: A lot of the people who inspect food aren't. The folks from the Department of Agriculture who check meatpacking plants are still working. But the guys at the Food and Drug Administration who make routine appearances at, say, the nut-shelling factory to look for vermin, are on furlough. Not to mention a lot of the people who check shipments of seafood or vegetables from outside the country.</p>

''The F.D.A. is really falling farther behind with every day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House of Representatives has passed a bill to refund the F.D.A. This is part of a Republican strategy to approve the financing of things they like, one by one. It's not entirely clear how popular the agency was before recent news of a salmonella outbreak erupted, but now it's right up there with the national parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how members of Congress fill up their time during the current crisis. The Republicans introduce bills to fund a particularly sympathetic sector of government. The Democrats respond with a proposal to fund the whole government. Then the Republicans say the Democrats are the enemy of veterans, parks, national guardsmen or food inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why don't we open the parts of government that we agree to?'' demanded Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll be here in December, doing agency by agency,'' responded Dick Durbin, the assistant majority leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span> would still be on furlough. Also the Labor Department. And the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. would probably be the last to return. That would be very tough on people who have serious issues they need to resolve. For instance, my husband, Dan, recently received a notice from the agency announcing that he was dead. Apparently this is a fairly common error, but Dan wants to be bureaucratically resurrected, and there's nobody on the other end of the phone to talk to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really, it's all personal. In fact, a good way to think about the current standoff is that it's a war between people who just want to have the government back and the people who want a new version of government with the priorities of Representative Ted Yoho of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am using Ted Yoho because he's a voluble figure in the caucus of right-wing hard-liners in the House who caused the shutdown in the first place. Also in part because I really enjoy writing ''Ted Yoho.'' Also because he has also been one of the leading lights in the new crisis over whether to let the country go smashing though the debt ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody talks about how destabilizing doing this will be on the markets. And you'll see that initially, but heck, I've seen that in my business,'' Yoho told Jonathan Weisman of The New York Times. ''When you go through that, and you address the problem and you address your creditors and say, 'Listen, we're going to pay you. We're just not going to pay you today, but we're going to pay you with interest and we will pay everybody that's due money' -- if you did that, the world would say America is finally addressing their problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Yoho was one of the very first members of Congress to verbalize the what-the-hey theory of global finance, possibly because he had all that background in debt management from his business, which is being a large-animal veterinarian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of Republicans have begun using their life sagas to support similar theories. ''We have in my household budget some bills that have to be paid and some bills that we can defer or only pay partially,'' Representative Joe Barton of Texas said on CNBC. ''I think paying interest on the debt has to be paid. I think paying Social Security payments have to be paid. But I don't think paying the secretary of energy's travel expenses have to be paid 100 cents on the dollar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sort of suggests that some members of Congress regard the Department of the Treasury as a vast warren of people with checkbooks, sorting through the mail and writing apologetic notes to Delta and <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> explaining the problem. It most definitely suggests that you do not want to lend money to a lot of people in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But back to our list:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news: The Congressional gym is open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.K., possibly only good news if you are a member of Congress. Or a person who enjoys making fun of members of Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news: The <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> called back some of its furloughed employees to try to control that salmonella outbreak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news: Most of the C.D.C. is still at home, including the ones who work on flu.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Donald E. Canfield, there's something astonishing in every breath we take. ''People take oxygen for granted because it's just there and we breathe it all the time,'' said Dr. Canfield, a geochemist at the University of Southern Denmark. ''But we have the only planet we know of anywhere that has oxygen on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's even more astonishing is that the earth started out with an oxygen-free atmosphere. It took billions of years before there was enough of it to keep animals like us alive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although scientists have been struggling for decades to reconstruct the rise of oxygen, they're still making fundamental discoveries. In just the past two weeks, for example, Dr. Canfield and his colleagues have published a pair of studies that provide significant clues about some of the most important chapters in oxygen's history. They're finding that our weirdly oxygen-rich atmosphere is the result of a complicated dance of geology and biology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To study the ancient atmosphere, geochemists examine the chemical fingerprints left behind on rocks. Some rocks contain molecules that could have formed only in the presence of oxygen. The more of those molecules geochemists find in a rock, the more oxygen must have been in the atmosphere at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they look at the oldest rocks on earth, they find no trace of oxygen in the atmosphere. Instead, their research indicates that earth's primordial air was made up mostly of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen. The sun's rays created some free oxygen by splitting it off from carbon dioxide and other molecules. But the oxygen disappeared almost as soon as it was formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because oxygen is an enormously friendly element, forming bonds with a wide range of molecules. It attached to the iron in rocks, for example, creating rust. It joined with hydrogen spewed out from volcanoes to form hydrogen peroxide and other compounds. Our planet, in other words, was a giant oxygen vacuum in its early years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed about three billion years ago. In the Sept. 26 issue of Nature, Dr. Canfield and his colleagues reported the fingerprints of oxygen in rocks from that time period. They estimate that the atmosphere three billion years ago had only 0.03 percent of today's oxygen levels. That may not sound like much, but it marked a huge shift in the earth's chemistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunlight alone couldn't have put that much oxygen in the atmosphere. Only life could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By three billion years ago, some microbes had evolved the ability to carry out photosynthesis. Floating at the surface of the ocean, they used energy from sunlight to grow on carbon dioxide and water. They gave off oxygen as waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the oxygen released by these photosynthetic microbes was sucked out of the atmosphere by the earth's vacuum. When microbes died, oxygen reacted with their carbon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a tiny amount of oxygen remained behind because some of the organic matter from the dead microbes sank from the surface of the ocean to the sea floor, where oxygen couldn't react with it. The oxygen remained in the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxygen remained fairly scarce for the next few hundred million years. But during that time, the earth's vacuum was getting weak. The planet was cooling, and so its volcanoes spewed less hydrogen into the atmosphere to suck up oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his forthcoming book, ''Oxygen: A Four Billion Year History,'' Dr. Canfield suggests that this weak vacuum drove a sudden climb in oxygen that geochemists see in rocks from about 2.3 billion years ago. ''Now we get to the point where the earth has calmed down enough that the balance has tipped in the favor of oxygen,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This oxygen boom may have added fuel to life's fire. The extra oxygen in the atmosphere attacked rocks exposed on land, freeing up phosphorus and iron to flow into the ocean to act as fertilizer. The microbes bloomed even more, sending up even more oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporting last week in The Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, Dr. Canfield and his colleagues report that there was so much oxygen in the atmosphere that it penetrated down a thousand feet into the ocean. Dr. Canfield speculates that oxygen may have become as abundant as it is today, at least for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this boom created its own bust. Microbes rained down onto the sea floor, creating carbon-rich rocks. Later, the rocks were lifted up to form dry land, where they could react with the oxygen, pulling it out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life itself, in other words, turned earth's vacuum back up again. By 2 billion years ago, oxygen levels were down to about 0.01 percent of current levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life and earth have continued to twiddle the oxygen knob over the past two billion years. When plants evolved, for example, they began storing huge amounts of carbon in wood and other tough tissues, leaving less to react with oxygen and pull it out of the atmosphere. By 300 million years ago, oxygen had risen to levels as high as 50 percent higher than today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as continents moved across the globe, the planet's geography came to favor deserts. Forests shrank, bringing down the oxygen levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Canfield gets better acquainted with the tumultuous history, he gets less certain about its future. Will the earth hold on to its remarkable supply of oxygen, or will it run low again? ''I'm not sure we have a good prediction,'' Dr. Canfield said. ''That depends a lot on the vagaries of geography.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Life in space is impossible.'' That stark statement of scientific fact is one of the first things to appear on screen in ''Gravity,'' but before long, it is contradicted, or at least complicated. As our eyes (from behind 3-D glasses) adjust to the vast darkness, illuminated by streaks of sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere, we detect movement that is recognizably human and hear familiar voices. Those tiny figures bouncing around on that floating contraption -- it looks like a mobile suspended from a child's bedroom ceiling -- are people. Scientists. Astronauts. Movie stars. (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in spacesuits, as Mission Specialist Ryan Stone and Mission Commander Matt Kowalski; Ed Harris, unseen and unnamed, as ''Houston'' down below).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defiance of impossibility is this movie's theme and its reason for being. But the main challenge facing the director, Alfonso Cuarón (who wrote the script with his son Jonás), is not visualizing the unimaginable so much as overcoming the audience's assumption that we've seen it all before. After more than 50 years, space travel has lost some of its luster, and movies are partly to blame for our jadedness. It has been a long time since a filmmaker conjured the awe of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' or the terror of ''Alien'' or captured afresh the spooky wonder of a trip outside our native atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuarón succeeds by tethering almost unfathomably complex techniques -- both digital and analog -- to a simple narrative. ''Gravity'' is less a science-fiction spectacle than a Jack London tale in orbit. The usual genre baggage has been jettisoned: there are no predatory extraterrestrials, no pompous flights of allegory, no extravagant pseudo-epic gestures. Instead, there is a swift and buoyant story of the struggle for survival in terrible, rapidly changing circumstances. Cosmic questions about our place in the universe are not so much avoided as subordinated to more pressing practical concerns. How do you outrun a storm of debris? Launch a landing module without fuel? Decipher an instruction manual in Russian or Chinese?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has recently been observed that not all of the film's answers to these questions are strictly accurate. The course that Stone and Kowalski plot from the Hubble Space Telescope to the International Space Station would apparently not be feasible in real life. (On the other hand, I was relieved to learn that a fire extinguisher really can serve as a makeshift zero-G jetpack. Not a spoiler, just a word to the wise.) Surely, though, the standard for a movie like this one is not realism but coherence. Every true outlaw has a code. The laws of physics are no exception, and Mr. Cuarón violates them with ingenious and exuberant rigor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accidental explosion of a communications satellite silences Houston and, what's worse, sends a blizzard of shrapnel hurtling toward the astronauts. Quite a bit goes wrong. Straps connecting astronauts to the relative security of their spacecraft are severed. Parachute lines foul engines. Fires break out inside vessels, and stuff outside is smashed to pieces. Not everyone survives. All of it -- terrifyingly and marvelously -- evades summary and confounds expectations. You have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what you see (through the exquisitely observant lenses of the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki) defies easy description. Stone and Kowalski's orbital path is perched between the inky infinite and the green, cloud-swept face of home. The perspective is dazzling and jarring, and Mr. Cuarón allows a few moments of quiet, contemplative beauty to punctuate the busy, desperate activity of staying alive. Kowalski, generally an irreverent joker, pauses to savor the sun over the Ganges, and you may find yourself picking out other geographical details. Look, there's Italy, and the Nile Valley. These reference points are as unsettling as they are reassuring, because they are glimpsed from a vantage point that is newly and profoundly alien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of estrangement owes a lot to Mr. Cuarón's use of 3-D, which surpasses even what James Cameron accomplished in the flight sequences of ''Avatar.'' More than that film (and more than ''Hugo'' or ''How to Train Your Dragon'' or any other high-quality recent specimens), ''Gravity'' treats 3-D as essential to the information it wants to share. The reason for that is summed up in the title, which names an obvious missing element. Nothing in the movie -- not hand tools or chess pieces, human bodies or cruise-ship-size space stations -- rests within a stable vertical or horizontal plane. Neither does the movie itself, which in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maybe not quite all of them, come to think of it. The script is, at times, weighed down by some heavy screenwriting clichés. Some are minor, like the fuel gauge that reads full until the glass is tapped, causing the arrow to drop. More cringe-inducing is the tragic back story stapled to Stone, a doctor on her first trip into orbit. We would care about her even without the haunting memory of a dead child, who inspires a maudlin monologue and a flight of orchestral bathos in Steven Price's otherwise canny and haunting score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will confess that the first time I saw ''Gravity,'' I found its talkiness annoying. Not just Ms. Bullock's perky-anxious soliloquizing, but also Mr. Clooney's gruff, regular-guy wisecracking. Doesn't Stone say her favorite thing about space is the silence?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a second viewing changed my mind a bit. It's not that the dialogue improved -- it will not be anyone's favorite part of the movie -- but rather that its relation to that silence became clearer. Stone and Kowalski jabber on, to themselves and each other and to Houston ''in the blind,'' partly to keep the terror of their situation at bay, to fight the overwhelming sense of how tiny and insignificant they are in the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This assertion of identity is ridiculous and also, for that very reason, affecting. For all of Mr. Cuarón's formal wizardry and pictorial grandeur, he is a humanist at heart. Much as ''Gravity'' revels in the giddy, scary thrill of weightlessness, it is, finally, about the longing to be pulled back down onto the crowded, watery sphere where life is tedious, complicated, sad and possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gravity'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Existential terror and the salty language it provokes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new movie ''Gravity'' is the closest most of us will ever come to going into space, and that may be for the best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as marooned astronauts, spinning out of control, bouncing off each other like yo-yos, is enough to make you forget your idyllic dreams of zero gravity. As Ms. Bullock tumbles and scrambles across arrays of solar panels and other spacecraft appendages, grabbing frantically at anything lest she float off to infinity -- in 3D, no less -- you feel every bounce.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gravity'' opens this week, but it has already won rapturous reviews at film festivals in Venice and Toronto. So when the distributor, Warner Brothers, offered me a chance to watch the movie with an actual astronaut, I happily tagged along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My companion was Michael J. Massimino, who flew missions in 2002 and 2009 to service the Hubble Space Telescope -- the same telescope the astronauts in ''Gravity'' were sent to repair. An engineer with a doctorate from M.I.T., he was delighted by the movie's fidelity to much of the space experience. During one scene, he nudged me, thrilled to point out that a tool Ms. Bullock was using looked just like his favorite space wrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also some inventive and very realistic use of the kickback from a fire extinguisher. The outboard scenery of the sunsets and auroras below comes straight from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> images taken from the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clooney, as a veteran spacewalker, with his resonant voice and folksy yarns, seems to be channeling every imperturbable astronaut you ever heard speaking from on high. And that opening scene, a long shot that begins with a majestic view of Earth and ends with Ms. Bullock's tumble, has earned the director, Alfonso Cuarón, comparisons to masters like Robert Altman and Michelangelo Antonioni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's not to like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You knew there was a ''but'' coming, right? Unfortunately, with all this verisimilitude, there is a hole in the plot: a gaping orbital impossibility big enough to drive the Starship Enterprise through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After they stop tumbling and find the shuttle destroyed and their colleagues all dead, Mr. Clooney tells Ms. Bullock that their only hope for rescue is to use his jetpack to travel to the space station, seen as a glowing light over the horizon. ''It's a long hike, but we can make it,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, space fans will groan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we recall from bitter memory, the Hubble and the space station are in vastly different orbits. Getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it. The telescope is 353 miles high, in an orbit that keeps it near the Equator; the space station is about 100 miles lower, in an orbit that takes it far north, over Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To have the movie astronauts Matt Kowalski (Mr. Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Ms. Bullock) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the Caribbean swim to London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might sound like some humorless quibble. But only 10 years ago, it was the source of a national debate on space policy, and it almost cost us the Hubble telescope. After the shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry in 2003, the NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, canceled the last remaining mission to service the telescope on the grounds that if a shuttle were to run into trouble it would not have enough fuel to reach a safe haven on the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision caused a national outcry. Congress and the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> got involved. Schoolchildren pooled their pennies to send to <span class="companylink">NASA</span> for a mission to the Hubble. Dr. Massimino reminded me that when the mission finally happened, in May 2009, another space shuttle was standing by at Cape Canaveral, ready to rocket into orbit if the astronauts needed rescue. Luckily they did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino achieved a kind of cosmic fame when, confronted with a stuck bolt that was blocking access to a broken spectrograph, he ripped a handrail off the side of the Hubble to get to it. He later said he was channeling memories of his Uncle Frank working on a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the Hubble is thriving a decade after its death sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spent several years writing about the Hubble controversy, so I suppose I might be taking this a little too personally. It would be nice to think there was a kind of infrastructure in space so you could shoot from one installation to another, whether in an emergency or to borrow a space wrench. But there isn't, and you can't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wouldn't matter so much had the producers not set such a high bar for themselves with their splendid re-creations of small things: the fogging helmets, the space tools. Violations of the known laws of physics happen in practically every frame of a ''Star Wars'' or ''Star Trek'' movie, and we don't care because we don't expect anything better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is the way it goes in the movies. They will hire art historians to make sure the curtains in Einstein's house look right -- it's a visual medium, after all -- but at some point, as the science fiction director David Twohy (''The Chronicles of Riddick'') said during a talk on movies and science, science gives way to the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, I wish they wouldn't always cheat on the physics. It makes me wish that Arthur C. Clarke, co-author of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and many science fiction classics, were still around. The opening of ''Gravity'' reminded me of ''2001'' with its balletic spaceships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir Arthur, who also invented the idea of communications satellites, took pride in getting the physics right. He reported that one story, ''Jupiter Five,'' about the discovery that a moon of Jupiter is actually an alien spaceship, had required 20 to 30 pages of orbital calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir Arthur would have found a way to let Ms. Bullock down gently, and lawfully.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looked to be uniformly bland, which is why scientists chose it as the first rock to be examined up close last year by the Mars rover Curiosity: a run-of-the-mill volcanic rock, something to test and calibrate the rover's instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock turned out to be anything but ordinary, scientists reported last week. It is unlike any Mars rock previously examined and more like an Earth rock.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for the pile of windblown dust and soil that the rover spent weeks analyzing? It was not dry as dust, but contained water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such are the surprises that turn out to be a near constant of Mars exploration, according to six new papers on the red planet that appeared last week -- five in the journal Science and one in The Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new findings are ''the nuts and bolts'' of what Curiosity has discovered so far, said John P. Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist. On Sept. 19, another paper from the science team reported that Curiosity had not detected any methane, which could have been a sign of present-day microbes. The mission is designed to see whether the building blocks of life existed on Mars, especially in the distant past, but includes no experiments to directly detect life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September last year, Curiosity rolled up to the volcanic rock, a pyramid-shaped chunk about the size of a football. The science team named it Jake M after Jacob R. Matijevic, a longtime NASA rover engineer who had died the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appeared to be a chunk of basalt, like many others strewed on the Martian surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just featureless,'' said Edward M. Stolper, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of one of the Science papers. ''It wasn't expected to be interesting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the first readings came back. The mix of elements was different from that of other Martian basalts. ''It just didn't look like any of the other guys,'' Dr. Stolper said. ''I could tell that this was an unusual rock type and that it had characteristics that reminded me of certain kinds of terrestrial rocks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock was alkaline, similar to a well-known but uncommon type of rock called mugearite, which is found on volcanic islands like Hawaii. ''People say that less than 1 percent of the rocks on Earth are alkaline,'' Dr. Stolper said. ''If you plopped down on Earth, you wouldn't find something like this likely randomly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, the magma that hardens into alkaline rocks comes from the melting of rocks deep in the mantle in the presence of water. That suggests that the movement of magma and other geological processes within Mars may have been more complex and interesting than has been thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People say, 'Sure, why not?' but we haven't seen it before,'' Dr. Stolper said of the composition of Jake M. ''It's not a little bit different. It's a lot different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, Curiosity visited the dirt pile -- a stationary Martian dune piled up by gale-force winds 50,000 to 200,000 years old -- and performed the first soil test in its chemistry laboratory, which is packed into a space the size of a microwave oven. The fine dust in the pile, which was named Rocknest, was expected to be a mix of what is blowing around the entire planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks pretty similar everywhere we go,'' said Laurie A. Leshin, a professor of earth and environmental science at <span class="companylink">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</span> and the lead author of another of the Science papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the dirt was scooped into the lab and heated, it released water vapor. Other analysis showed that the dirt and dust consisted of both tiny crystals where the atoms lined up in neat patterns and what the scientists called ''amorphous'' materials -- the atoms jumbled up randomly, as in glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no evidence of water in the crystallized minerals, so all of the water -- 2 percent by weight -- was chemically bound up in the glassy particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's actually a fair amount,'' Dr. Leshin said. ''We always think of Mars as being this dry desert planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water in the dust could be a resource for future astronauts. Heating up a cubic foot of dirt would yield a couple of pints of water, Dr. Leshin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger, the project scientist, said the water could also conceivably be something for hypothetical Martian microbes to drink, although Curiosity has yet to find any of the molecules necessary for carbon-based life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possibly complicating life for human visitors, Curiosity also found that the chemicals called perchlorates, which can cause thyroid problems, are prevalent at the landing site. An earlier NASA mission, Phoenix Mars, had found perchlorates near the north pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's suggesting perhaps a global distribution of these salts,'' said Daniel P. Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory and the lead author of the paper that reported the perchlorate findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perchlorates also complicate Curiosity's search for the carbon-based molecules known as organics that could be the building blocks for life, past or present. Heated in the presence of perchlorates, organic molecules disintegrate into simple carbon dioxide.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKHOLM -- The world's top climate scientists on Friday formally embraced an upper limit on greenhouse gases for the first time, establishing a target level at which humanity must stop spewing them into the atmosphere or face irreversible climatic changes. They warned that the target is likely to be exceeded in a matter of decades unless steps are taken soon to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unveiling the latest United Nations assessment of climate science, the experts cited a litany of changes that were already under way, warned that they were likely to accelerate and expressed virtual certainty that human activity is the main cause. ''Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time,'' said Thomas F. Stocker, co-chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations-sponsored group of scientists that produced the report. ''In short, it threatens our planet, our only home.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel, in issuing its most definitive assessment yet of the risks of human-caused warming, hoped to give impetus to international negotiations toward a new climate treaty, which have languished in recent years in a swamp of technical and political disputes. The group made clear that time was not on the planet's side if emissions continued unchecked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,'' the report said. ''It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report is a 36-page summary for world leaders of a 900-page report that is to be released next week on the physical science of climate change. That will be followed by additional reports in 2014 on the most likely impacts and on possible steps to limit the damage. A draft of the summary leaked last month, and the final version did not change greatly, though it was edited for clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going well beyond its four previous analyses of the emissions problem, the panel endorsed a ''carbon budget'' for humanity -- a limit on the amount of the primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, that can be produced by industrial activities and the clearing of forests. No more than one trillion metric tons of carbon could be burned and the resulting gases released into the atmosphere, the panel found, if planetary warming is to be kept below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the level of preindustrial times. That temperature is a target above which scientists believe the most dangerous effects of climate change would begin to occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over a half-trillion tons have already been burned since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and at the rate energy consumption is growing, the trillionth ton will be burned sometime around 2040, according to calculations by Myles R. Allen, a scientist at the <span class="companylink">University of Oxford</span> and one of the authors of the new report. More than three trillion tons of carbon are still left in the ground as fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the trillion-ton budget is exhausted, companies that wanted to keep burning fossil fuels would have to come up with ways to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground. In the United States, the Obama administration is moving forward with rules that would essentially require such technology, which is likely to be costly, for any future coal-burning power plants; the president's Republican opponents have accused him of waging a ''war on coal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a worldwide committee of hundreds of scientists that issues major reports every five or six years, advising governments on the latest knowledge on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group has now issued five major reports since 1990, each of them finding greater certainty that the world is warming and greater likelihood that human activity is the chief cause. The new report finds a 95 to 100 percent chance that most of the warming of recent decades is human-caused, up from the 90 to 100 percent chance cited in the last report, in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new document also acknowledges that climate science still contains uncertainties, including the likely magnitude of the warming for a given level of emissions, the rate at which the ocean will rise, and the likelihood that plants and animals will be driven to extinction. The scientists emphasized, however, that those uncertainties cut in both directions and the only way to limit the risk is to limit emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate-skeptic organizations assailed the new report as alarmist even before it was published.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Heartland Institute, a Chicago organization, issued a document last week saying that any additional global warming would likely be limited to a few tenths of a degree and that this ''would not represent a climate crisis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One issue much cited by the climate doubters is the slowdown in global warming that has occurred over the past 15 years. The report acknowledged that it was not fully understood, but said such pauses had occurred in the past and the natural variability of climate was a likely explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think that global warming means every year is going to be warmer than the year before,'' said Gerald A. Meehl, an American scientist who helped write the report. ''It's more like a stair-step kind of thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate scientists not involved in writing the new report said the authors had made a series of cautious choices in their assessment of the scientific evidence. Regarding sea level rise, for instance, they gave the first firm estimates ever contained in an intergovernmental panel report, declaring that if emissions continued at a rapid pace, the rise by the end of the 21st century could be as much as three feet. They threw out a string of published papers suggesting a worst-case rise closer to five feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the authors went out of their way to include recent papers suggesting that the earth might be less sensitive to carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought, even though serious questions have been raised about the validity of those estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report lowered the bottom end of the range of potential warming that could be expected to occur over the long term if the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere were to double, reversing a decision that the panel made in the last report and restoring a scientific consensus that had prevailed from 1979 to 2007. Six years ago, that range was reported as 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit; the new range is 2.7 to 8.1 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, President Obama's science adviser, John P. Holdren, cited increased scientific confidence ''that the kinds of harm already being experienced from climate change will continue to worsen unless and until comprehensive and vigorous action to reduce emissions is undertaken worldwide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, spoke to delegates at the meeting on Friday by video link, declaring his intention to call a meeting of heads of state in 2014 to push such a treaty forward. The last such meeting, in Copenhagen in 2009, ended in disarray.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the height of the 11-year solar cycle, the so-called solar maximum. The face of the Sun should be pockmarked with sunspots, and cataclysmic explosions of X-rays and particles should be whizzing off every which way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the Sun has been tranquil, almost spotless.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As W. Dean Pesnell, the project scientist for NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, dryly noted, ''We're not having much of a solar maximum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, a solitary sunspot blemished an otherwise blank yellow disk. In the ensuing days, a few more specks appeared, but even a small explosion, or coronal mass ejection, last Thursday seemed like the halfhearted effort of a slacker star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The truth of it is there isn't a lot going on,'' said Joseph M. Kunches, a space scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. ''It's been a bit of a dud. You look at the Sun today and you say, 'What?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who depend on Dr. Kunches's work, like satellite operators and power companies, that is actually good news. One of the worries in our highly technological 21st-century civilization is that a direct hit on Earth by a gargantuan solar storm could disable satellites and overwhelm wide swaths of power grids. A quiet Sun makes that much less likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists trying to understand the dynamics in the interior of the Sun, it has been a humbling experience enlightening them about how much they do not know. ''If there's anyone who has figured it out, I haven't heard, that's for sure,'' said Douglas Biesecker, a physicist at the Space Weather Prediction Center and the chairman of a panel that had issued predictions about the solar cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do have a basic understanding. Inside the Sun, flows of electrons and protons generate magnetic fields that undulate on roughly an 11-year schedule. The roiling of the fields create regions that are cooler and darker -- sunspots. The twisting magnetic fields within sunspots periodically snap, releasing enormous amounts of energy in solar flares and coronal mass ejections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some solar cycles are ferocious while others remain calm. Why the cycle is 11 years is another mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This cycle, No. 24 since scientists started counting, has been befuddling from the start. Some expected an active cycle, similar to the ones of the recent past. Others predicted that this one would be quieter than usual; those predictions looked prescient as the lull of solar minimum stretched longer and deeper than expected. In 2008, the Sun was spotless on 266 days -- the blankest in half a century. The following year, when the percolating of sunspots should have picked up, the Sun was blank for 260 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar activity picked up in 2010 and especially 2011. Then the number of sunspots started dropping again. That was not necessarily surprising. In some previous cycles the Sun's northern hemisphere became active first, and scientists expected a second peak in sunspots as the southern hemisphere entered its active period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The southern hemisphere indeed began to perk up, but then leveled off and has remained that way for the past year, leading to more head-scratching. ''In all honesty, it really feels like the Sun can't make up its mind,'' Dr. Biesecker said. ''It's just this flat mesa, and it's not budging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is no second peak, and solar maximum actually occurred two years ago, then Solar Cycle 24 would be extremely odd -- late to start and early to end. ''What would surprise me is if it didn't pick up over the next year,'' Dr. Pesnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How far back do have scientists have to look back to find a solar maximum quite as weak? As far back as <span class="companylink">Chicago Cubs</span> fans do for a World Series championship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cycle 14 in the early 1900s was similarly quiet. (The Cubs won the 1908 World Series, about a year after the maximum of that solar cycle.) This time, solar scientists have Sun-watching satellites providing reams of data for them to analyze. ''For the first time, we'll be looking at a solar cycle that's really different from the ones we've seen before,'' Dr. Pesnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pesnell says it has already become apparent that the flow patterns within the Sun are more complicated than had been supposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the minimal sunspots, the Sun is still going through the rest of its cycle as usual. Its magnetic field is on the cusp of flipping, as expected. At solar maximum, the magnetic fields at the poles essentially disappear for a brief time, and when they re-emerge, they are pointing in the opposite direction. If you had a compass on the Sun's north pole and it were pointing north before solar maximum, it would be pointing south after solar maximum. (Actually, the compass would vaporize.) The north pole has already flipped; the south pole is behind but last month scientists at Stanford's Wilcox Solar Observatory said they expected the transition to be complete soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do see indications that solar maximum is about now,'' Dr. Pesnell said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In findings that are as scientifically significant as they are crushing to the popular imagination, NASA reported Thursday that its Mars rover, Curiosity, has deflated hopes that life could be thriving on Mars today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conclusion, published in the journal Science, comes from the fact that Curiosity has been looking for methane, a gas that is considered a possible calling card of microbes, and has so far found none of it. While the absence of methane does not rule out the possibility of present-day life on Mars -- there are plenty of microbes, on Earth at least, that do not produce methane -- it does return the idea to the realm of pure speculation without any hopeful data to back it up.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of human fascination with the possibility of life on Mars is rich, encompassing myriad works of science fiction, Percival Lowell's quixotic efforts to map what turned out to be imaginary canals, Orson Welles's panic-inducing 1938 ''War of the Worlds'' radio play, and of course Bugs Bunny's nemesis, Marvin the Martian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Marvin apparently did not emit enough methane for Curiosity's sensitive instruments to find him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't have direct evidence that there is microbial process going on,'' said Sushil K. Atreya, a professor of atmospheric and space science at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> and a member of the science team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA scientists are going strictly by their data, and they are leery about drawing broader implications to the question once posed by David Bowie, ''Is there life on Mars?'' John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist for the Curiosity mission, would go only so far as to say that the lack of this gas ''does diminish'' the possibility of methane-exhaling creatures going about their business on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would have been great if we got methane,'' Dr. Atreya said. ''It just isn't there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity, which has been trundling across the planet for a little over a year, made measurements from Martian spring to late summer, coming up empty for methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have long thought that Mars, warm and wet in its early years, could have been hospitable for life, and the new findings do not mean that it was not. But that was about three and a half billion years ago. Methane molecules break apart over a few centuries -- victims of the Sun's ultraviolet light and of chemical reactions in the atmosphere -- so any methane in the air from primordial times would have disappeared long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why reports of huge plumes of methane rising over Mars in 2003 fueled fresh hopes for Martian microbes. Those findings, based on data from telescopes on Earth and a spacecraft orbiting Mars, set off a surge of speculation and scientific interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, most of the methane comes from micro-organisms known as methanogens, but the gas is also produced without living organisms, in hydrothermal vents. Either possibility would be a surprising result for Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2003 methane readings, ''a lot people got excited and started working on it,'' said Christopher R. Webster of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the lead author of the paper in Science. ''It was a very important result, because of the magnitude of methane.'' The fresh data from Curiosity brings the earlier claims into question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is daunted. Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to the planet's exploration and settlement, said he was still convinced that Martian life was waiting to be discovered in underground aquifers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it had found methane, that would have been killer,'' Dr. Zubrin said, referring to Curiosity. ''Yes, it's disappointing in that we didn't get a pony for Christmas. But it doesn't mean there aren't ponies out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the scientists who found the methane plumes in 2003, Michael J. Mumma, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in an interview this week he was certain that his earlier measurements were still valid. He said he now believed that methane on Mars was episodic -- released in large plumes and then quickly destroyed. He suggested, half-jokingly, that there could be huge colonies of methane-eating microbes on Mars that eliminated the gas from the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mumma acknowledged that he could not identify any phenomena that would explain why methane plumes spurted out that year but not more recently, or how methane could be destroyed much more quickly on Mars than on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mars may not be operating the same way,'' he said. ''It's a puzzle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Atreya of the Curiosity team said he originally thought that highly reactive chemicals on the Martian surface could be destroying methane, as Dr. Mumma envisioned. But ''that's not panning out,'' Dr. Atreya said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simpler explanation would be that there was never much in the way of methane -- or microbes -- on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Stanley Robinson, a science fiction author, wrote three novels in the 1990s about the colonization of Mars by people from Earth, which in his version of things begins in 2026. Except for one conversation between two scientists, he completely leaves out the possibility of indigenous Martian microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my Mars trilogy, I assumed what everyone assumed back then, which was that it was a dead rock,'' Mr. Robinson said by e-mail on Thursday. ''Actually, it would be very problematic to write that book today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days there are plans, on paper, to send humans to Mars in roughly Mr. Robinson's time frame. One of them, a private effort called Mars One, which has yet to prove it has the technology to achieve its goals, has nevertheless attracted hundreds of thousands of people to apply for a one-way trip, which theoretically would arrive in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars is smaller than Earth and would have cooled off sooner after the formation of the solar system. Some scientists have even suggested that all life on Earth could be descended from Martian microbes that were carried here embedded within meteorites. As the surface of Mars turned cold and dry and most of the air dispersed to space, microbes could have migrated underground and persisted, the thinking goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pursue the methane mystery, Curiosity was outfitted with an instrument that can measure minute quantities of methane and other gases. The first measurements by Curiosity last fall showed a definite signal from methane. ''When we saw it for it for the first time, we went 'Oh, my gosh,' '' Dr. Webster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that turned out to be from residual air from Earth carried all the way to Mars. Once the Earth air was pumped away, the methane readings disappeared, too. Last November, the scientists reported an upper limit of 6 parts per billion. Now they have pushed that down to 1.3 parts per billion and expect to improve their precision by at least another factor of 10 in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As exciting as it is to see the beautiful full-color pictures of the Martian landscape that Curiosity sends back, it is the tantalizing prospect of creatures living on a neighboring planet that fuels public interest the most, space enthusiasts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the mythology,'' said Seth Shostak, an astronomer with the Seti Institute in Mountain View, Calif., which searches for intelligent life in the universe. ''Mars is about life, not geology, as interesting as that is. That's the triumph of hope over measurement, and maybe it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a month, India is to launch a Mars orbiter that also has a methane-measuring instrument to look for the gas from orbit. ''They may be disappointed when they try to create maps of methane,'' Dr. Webster said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're All Martians, Scientist Claims,'' The Telegraph wrote on Aug. 28. Similar articles showed up in newspapers and on Web sites around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist who inspired all the headlines is a chemist named Steven Benner. Headlines notwithstanding, Dr. Benner is not a wild-eyed U.F.O. advocate claiming to have seen Little Green Men. Instead, he is one of the world's leading experts on the origin of life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Steve is one of the master organic chemists tackling this problem,'' said Robert M. Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution and the author of ''The Story of Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause for Dr. Benner's new-found celebrity is a lecture he delivered at a geology conference in Florence, Italy, on Aug. 29. During his talk, he did not wave satellite pictures of canals on Mars, or of Martian hills that vaguely look like a human face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he challenged his fellow scientists to look hard at the evidence we have about how life began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on how you view that evidence, Dr. Benner argued, Mars might be a more likely place for life to have started than Earth. The best way to determine the actual answer, Dr. Benner argued, is to look for certain types of chemicals on both planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really don't have a dog in this fight,'' said Dr. Benner, a distinguished fellow at the Westheimer Institute at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Gainesville, Fla., in a telephone interview after he returned from Italy. ''It could go either way and I would be equally happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, Dr. Benner and his colleagues have amassed evidence for one potential path by which chemicals could have become living matter. Small organic compounds could have reacted with each other to produce string-shaped, self-replicating molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These strands, known as RNA, later combined into double-strands: the DNA in which we and other species encode our genes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In chemical experiments, Dr. Benner and his colleagues have demonstrated the occurrence of many of the reactions in this path. But they've also discovered roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the precursors to RNA can bond in a lot of ways, some good and some bad. While some reactions can lead organic molecules toward RNA, many others can turn them into gooey tar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Benner and his colleagues discovered that minerals containing borate could help life overcome this obstacle. Binding to the precursors of RNA, borate blocks them from reacting in destructive ways, so they are much more likely to form compounds that could eventually give rise to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in the presence of borate, Dr. Benner and his colleagues have found, these precursors can't make some of the final changes that turn them into RNA. And just recently the researchers found a way out of this bind. Molybdate minerals can react with the precursors to help them become RNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this chemistry may work in the lab, however, it may not have worked on the early Earth. Dr. Hazen and other geologists have argued that it's unlikely that borate or molybdate were abundant on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, borate is found in deserts that formed after large seas evaporated. But deserts may not have existed four billion years ago. A number of studies suggest that the early Earth was covered in water and had few if any continents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for molybdate, it only forms in the presence of oxygen. The atmosphere of the early Earth appears to have been nearly oxygen-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, Mars looks more promising to Dr. Benner. The evidence gathered by satellites and rovers suggests that both oceans and continents existed early in the planet's lifetime. Under those conditions, borate might have formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just this June, some more evidence emerged that supports this idea. Studying a meteorite from Mars, scientists at the University of Hawaii reported that it contained high levels of boron, a component of borate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atmosphere of early Mars also shows signs of having contained oxygen, enabling molybdate to form. With a supply of both borate and molybdate, Mars might have been a favorable place for RNA to emerge, and for life to start. A giant impact on the Red Planet could then have kicked up microbe-laden rocks, which later fell to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his recent lecture, Dr. Benner did not present this argument as proof that we are Martians. Instead, he offered a way to organize our thinking about the origin of life. One of his lecture slides was entitled ''A Logic Tree.'' It displayed a series of linked questions that scientists should ask themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first question is, did life start out as RNA? If the answer is no -- and some scientists believe that to be the case -- then they have to grapple with a different set of challenges to explain the origin of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists who do accept an RNA-based origin of life, however, they need to find chemistry to produce it. Dr. Benner has one hypothesis. If scientists don't like it, then it's up to them to find an alternative -- which other scientists are indeed doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you accept Dr. Benner's chemistry, then you have to find a place with oxygen and dry land where it can unfold. If the early Earth doesn't meet those standards, then we have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the logic that drives you to Mars,'' said Dr. Benner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hazen, who invited Dr. Benner to deliver the lecture in Italy, said: ''He made a good, logical case.'' He praised Dr. Benner's specific suggestions about what evidence geologists should be looking for to see which way we should travel down the logic tree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hazen, for one, is taking Dr. Benner up on the challenge to find evidence to test our ideas about the origin of life. He is now studying 3.8-billion-year-old rocks from Greenland, inside which are boron-laden minerals. If the boron once existed as borate in deserts -- something Dr. Hazen doubts -- then it may have left some clues behind in the rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to prove myself wrong before somebody else does,'' said Dr. Hazen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Hazen's research bears fruit, then Dr. Benner will happily abandon the idea that our ancestors started out on the Red Planet. ''Then I have all the deserts I need. I don't have to go to Mars,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades After Launching, a First</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, something made by humans on Earth has entered interstellar space. Instruments aboard Voyager 1, launched by NASA back in 1977, observed a year ago that the wind of particles blowing out from the Sun had suddenly disappeared. That led some to conclude that it had left the solar system, but top mission scientists disagreed, because Voyager 1 did not observe an expected change in the magnetic field. Unfortunately, the instrument that could have directly answered the question broke in 1980. But then a barrage of particles from a solar eruption passed by Voyager, and that generated vibrations that could be detected by another instrument on the spacecraft. The data matched expectations for interstellar space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GEOLOGY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shorter, but Still the Tallest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tallest mountain in North America is a little shorter than previously thought. Mount McKinley in Alaska, also known as Denali, is 20,237 feet high, according to sophisticated radar measurements by the <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span>. That shaves 83 feet off the commonly published height of 20,320 feet, determined in 1952 from photographs. National Public Radio reports that McKinley remains ahead of No. 2: Mount Logan in Canada, a mere 19,550 feet high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOOD SCIENCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tingle Is Only a Feeling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sichuan cuisine revolves around Sichuan peppercorns, which impart a numbing tingle on the tongue and lips. Researchers at <span class="companylink">University College London</span> report that it is not taste receptors in the mouth that pick up the unusual culinary quality but rather nerve fibers that detect vibrations. In other words, the spice makes your lips feel as though they are vibrating rapidly, even though they are not. The researchers were even able to determine the frequency of the faux vibrations: about 50 times a second.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arctic Ice's Comeback</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each year, the warmth of summer melts the Arctic sea ice, and as the earth warms, the ice has been shrinking. This summer, the Arctic ice bounced back -- at the end of the melting season, it was 60 percent larger in extent than it was last year. That sounds like a giant change, but last year was a record low. In addition, satellite data shows that during the previous winter, the thickness of ice was a record low, further evidence that the long-term trend is still steadily downward. And the <span class="companylink">National Climatic Data Center</span> reported last week that the United States this year experienced the 15th warmest summer on record -- the coolest since 2009, although still 1.2 degrees above the 20th-century average.</p>

A team of researchers, mostly in Britain, had earlier found a correlation in dyslexia patients between a gene, PCSK6, and handedness. That was intriguing because PCSK6 is associated with left-right symmetry in the body. A <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> blog reported that the researchers expanded their study to 2,600 people without dyslexia and found that the single gene could not fully explain handedness but that other genes, also associated with left-right symmetry, appeared to play a role.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid light pollution and bad weather, professional astronomers have to be prepared to travel long distances to use telescopes on mountaintops far away from towns or cities. Astronomers from Britain, which is not generally well known for its clear skies, are particularly used to traveling. When I was an astronomer in the 1990s, working at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh and at <span class="companylink">Imperial College London</span>, I made regular trips to observatories around the world, especially in Chile.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back home, all I could usually see were a few lonely stars fighting against the clouds lit up by a flat dull wash of reflected streetlight. Looking up from the Andes was a fundamentally different experience -- the sky was so bright with stars that there were scarcely any dark gaps between them. To make the experience even more striking, in the Southern Hemisphere you can see phenomena like the Magellanic Clouds, the crowded heart of the Milky Way and the jewel-like constellation of the Southern Cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was studying quasars, some of the most distant known objects in the universe, which are understood to be the bright centers of galaxies containing supermassive black holes. At a superficial glance, quasars don't look particularly interesting. All you can see is a starlike point of light, because the extraordinarily bright center dwarfs the rest of the galaxy. But detailed measurements of quasars reveal their vast distances and the amazingly high speeds of the gases that spin around the invisible black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I first went to Chile's Atacama Desert, in 1990 -- the year Augusto Pinochet finally stepped down after nearly 16 years in power -- I found that the terrestrial landscape was almost as extraordinary as the objects I studied in the sky. In some parts of the desert it rains only once every few years. During the day there is nothing to see but rocks and sand and the dazzling sunlight reflected from distant telescope domes at the other observatories around the mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this time, astronomy was on the cusp of changing technologies. I was accustomed to using old-fashioned glass photographic plates -- 13 inches across and thin enough to be curved into the focal plane of the telescope. The light of stars was caught in the photographic emulsion on the plates, and the resulting complicated shapes of galaxies reminded me of insects preserved in amber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this sort of photography was dying out and being superseded by C.C.D.'s -- electronic devices that created virtual images of the sky, and the precursors to today's digital cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So instead of fitting the plates into the telescope by hand while gazing out at the sky, observing in Chile meant sitting in a control room and operating the telescope remotely. Resulting images were displayed on computer screens. We saw the telescope only at the beginning of the night, when we were setting up, and at the end, when we shut everything down as the sun rose. During the night we didn't even see the sky, because the control room -- with its banks of computers that made it look like a low-rent Starship Enterprise -- had no windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few nights of this work, everything, not just my quasars, started to feel remote. The objects on the screen reminded me of ghosts, with no substance to them. Going outside helped somewhat, the stars looked so large and real I felt I could reach out and grab them, but in contrast the landscape was so empty I might as well have been on the moon. There was nothing to pull me back to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I used to remind myself that I was there to work, and nothing more. But I would long for the complexities of life, tedious British rain and the screech of sea gulls, even traffic jams started to have a certain nostalgic charm. As I sat in the control room, I would reread old newspapers, trying to keep faith with the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at that, I did not succeed. I know now that the desert wasn't empty, that it had a terrible secret; further north of the observatory, in an even more remote part of the Andes, was an abandoned prison camp set up during the Pinochet regime, called Chacabuco. This was a place where political opponents of the regime were sent in the 1970s. Sometimes they died there. As the celebrated 2010 Chilean documentary ''Nostalgia for the Light'' shows, their relatives are still searching the desert for their remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our telescopes had the power to detect candle flames many miles away, not to mention galaxies billions of light years away. And yet they never turned toward the camp. They weren't built to do that sort of observation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And nor were we. The observatory that I visited in Chile is part of the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span>. It's one of the largest in the world and was first conceived of not long after World War II, partly as a way of bringing together former enemies and encouraging peaceful scientific endeavors. But our only political contribution was neutrality: we were supposed to keep our heads down and get on with our work. When I arrived, we were advised not to talk about politics with people in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I left the world of professional astronomy some time ago. In the years since, I have often thought of how astronomy is seen as a benign, unbiased science. Its sole function is to increase our understanding of how the universe works: astronomers receive and record, but they do not experiment or perturb. They are not tainted by any application to, say, energy development or military technologies. Astronomy is, essentially, a passive science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember realizing when I was a student that I could make a measurement of an object in the sky, and how extraordinary that felt to me, as if it were a way of reaching out and connecting with something so far away. But maybe I found distant galaxies easier to understand than the people around me, and I wonder if my work became a substitute for any true connection. I still look to the edge of the universe, but I try to remember always to keep one eye focused here on earth.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BALTIMORE -- MANY scientists believe that by transforming the earth's natural landscapes, we are undermining the very life support systems that sustain us. Like bacteria in a petri dish, our exploding numbers are reaching the limits of a finite planet, with dire consequences. Disaster looms as humans exceed the earth's natural carrying capacity. Clearly, this could not be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is nonsense. Even today, I hear some of my scientific colleagues repeat these and similar claims -- often unchallenged. And once, I too believed them. Yet these claims demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the ecology of human systems. The conditions that sustain humanity are not natural and never have been. Since prehistory, human populations have used technologies and engineered ecosystems to sustain populations well beyond the capabilities of unaltered ''natural'' ecosystems.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence from archaeology is clear. Our predecessors in the genus Homo used social hunting strategies and tools of stone and fire to extract more sustenance from landscapes than would otherwise be possible. And, of course, Homo sapiens went much further, learning over generations, once their preferred big game became rare or extinct, to make use of a far broader spectrum of species. They did this by extracting more nutrients from these species by cooking and grinding them, by propagating the most useful species and by burning woodlands to enhance hunting and foraging success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the last ice age had ended, thousands of years before agriculture, hunter-gatherer societies were well established across the earth and depended increasingly on sophisticated technological strategies to sustain growing populations in landscapes long ago transformed by their ancestors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet's carrying capacity for prehistoric human hunter-gatherers was probably no more than 100 million. But without their Paleolithic technologies and ways of life, the number would be far less -- perhaps a few tens of millions. The rise of agriculture enabled even greater population growth requiring ever more intensive land-use practices to gain more sustenance from the same old land. At their peak, those agricultural systems might have sustained as many as three billion people in poverty on near-vegetarian diets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world population is now estimated at 7.2 billion. But with current industrial technologies, the <span class="companylink">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</span> has estimated that the more than nine billion people expected by 2050 as the population nears its peak could be supported as long as necessary investments in infrastructure and conducive trade, anti-poverty and food security policies are in place. Who knows what will be possible with the technologies of the future? The important message from these rough numbers should be clear. There really is no such thing as a human carrying capacity. We are nothing at all like bacteria in a petri dish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is it that highly trained natural scientists don't understand this? My experience is likely to be illustrative. Trained as a biologist, I learned the classic mathematics of population growth -- that populations must have their limits and must ultimately reach a balance with their environments. Not to think so would be to misunderstand physics: there is only one earth, of course!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only after years of research into the ecology of agriculture in China that I reached the point where my observations forced me to see beyond my biologists's blinders. Unable to explain how populations grew for millenniums while increasing the productivity of the same land, I discovered the agricultural economist Ester Boserup, the antidote to the demographer and economist Thomas Malthus and his theory that population growth tends to outrun the food supply. Her theories of population growth as a driver of land productivity explained the data I was gathering in ways that Malthus could never do. While remaining an ecologist, I became a fellow traveler with those who directly study long-term human-environment relationships -- archaeologists, geographers, environmental historians and agricultural economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science of human sustenance is inherently a social science. Neither physics nor chemistry nor even biology is adequate to understand how it has been possible for one species to reshape both its own future and the destiny of an entire planet. This is the science of the Anthropocene. The idea that humans must live within the natural environmental limits of our planet denies the realities of our entire history, and most likely the future. Humans are niche creators. We transform ecosystems to sustain ourselves. This is what we do and have always done. Our planet's human-carrying capacity emerges from the capabilities of our social systems and our technologies more than from any environmental limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two hundred thousand years ago we started down this path. The planet will never be the same. It is time for all of us to wake up to the limits we really face: the social and technological systems that sustain us need improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no environmental reason for people to go hungry now or in the future. There is no need to use any more land to sustain humanity -- increasing land productivity using existing technologies can boost global supplies and even leave more land for nature -- a goal that is both more popular and more possible than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only limits to creating a planet that future generations will be proud of are our imaginations and our social systems. In moving toward a better Anthropocene, the environment will be what we make it.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, Calif. -- By today's standards, the spacecraft's technology is laughable: it carries an 8-track tape recorder and computers with one-240,000th the memory of a low-end iPhone. When it left Earth 36 years ago, it was designed as a four-year mission to Saturn, and everything after that was gravy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Voyager 1 has become -- thrillingly -- the Little Spacecraft That Could. On Thursday, scientists declared that it had become the first probe to exit the solar system, a breathtaking achievement that NASA could only fantasize about back when Voyager was launched in 1977, the same year ''Star Wars'' was released.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know if it's in the same league as landing on the moon, but it's right up there -- 'Star Trek' stuff, for sure,'' said Donald A. Gurnett, a physics professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Iowa</span> and the co-author of a paper published Thursday in the journal Science about Voyager's feat. ''I mean, consider the distance. It's hard even for scientists to comprehend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among planetary scientists, who tend to dream large, the idea that something they built could travel beyond the Sun's empire and keep grinding away is impressive. Plenty of telescopes gaze at the far parts of the Milky Way, but Voyager 1 can now touch and feel the cold, unexplored region in between the stars and send back detailed dispatches about conditions there. It takes 17 hours and 22 minutes for Voyager's signals to reach NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is historic stuff, a bit like the first exploration of Earth, and we had to look at the data very, very carefully,'' said Edward C. Stone, 77, NASA's top Voyager expert, who has been working on the project since 1972. He said he was excited about what comes next. ''It's now the start of a whole new mission,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lonely probe, which is 11.7 billion miles from Earth and hurtling away at 38,000 miles per hour, has long been on the cusp, treading a boundary between the bubble of hot, energetic particles around the solar system and the dark region beyond. There, in interstellar space, the plasma, or ionized gas, is noticeably denser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gurnett and his team have spent the past few months analyzing their data, trying to nail down whether what they were seeing was solar plasma or the plasma of interstellar space. Now they are certain it was the latter, and have even pinpointed a date for the crossing: Aug. 25, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Thursday, NASA scientists were a bit vague about what they hope to get from Voyager 1 from now on. The answer, to some extent, depends on what instruments continue to function as the power supply dwindles. Dr. Stone expects Voyager 1 to keep sending back data -- with a 23-watt transmitter, about the equivalent of a refrigerator light bulb -- until roughly 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hope is that Voyager 1's position will allow scientists to more accurately study galactic cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles that originate outside the solar system. They would use the information to make judgments about what interstellar space is like at even greater distances from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its heyday, Voyager 1 pumped out never-before-seen images of Jupiter and Saturn. But it stopped sending home pictures in 1990, to conserve energy and because there was no longer much to see. A companion spacecraft, Voyager 2, also launched in 1977, has stopped sending back images as well. Voyager 2 is moving in a different direction but is also expected to exit the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, NASA said, the Voyagers will pass other stars, coasting and drifting and being pulled by gravity. The next big encounter for Voyager 1, in around 40,000 years, is expected to be a dwarf star dispassionately known as AC+793888 in the constellation of Camelopardalis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But already, Voyager 1 has achieved what Dr. Gurnett called ''the holy grail of heliosphere research.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 1 left the solar system the same month that Curiosity, NASA's state-of-the-art rover, landed on Mars and started sending home gorgeous snapshots. Curiosity's exploration team, some 400 strong, promptly dazzled the world by driving the $2.5 billion robot across a patch of Martian terrain, a feat that turned the Red Bull-chugging engineers and scientists of Building 264 of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus into rock stars. By comparison, the Voyager mission looked like a Betamax in the era of Bluetooth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-person Voyager staff was long ago moved from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus to cramped quarters down the street, next to a <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>. In an interview last month at Voyager's offices, Suzanne R. Dodd, the Voyager project manager, said that when she attended meetings in Building 264, she kept a low profile in deference to the Mars team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I try to stay out of the elevator and take the stairs,'' Ms. Dodd said. ''They're doing important work there, and I'll only slow them down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 52, Ms. Dodd is a relative newcomer to Voyager, first working on the mission in 1984. Now she and her team seem poised to return to the spotlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the solar system's edge grew tantalizingly close, NASA asked the Voyager scientists to increase the amount of data collection. The problem: the 8-track data recorders from 1977 were not exactly bursting with extra space. Could Ms. Dodd even find anyone who specialized in that piece of technology and could coax it to record more?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These younger engineers can write a lot of sloppy code, and it doesn't matter, but here, with very limited capacity, you have to be extremely precise and have a real strategy,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was able to find her man: Lawrence J. Zottarelli, 77, a retired NASA engineer. He came up with a solution. But would it work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zottarelli waited at Voyager mission control one afternoon last month to find out. The first of the newly programmed data dumps was set to come down. Ms. Dodd, Dr. Stone and Mr. Zottarelli watched two old <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span> computers like children watching for a chick to peck through an egg. ''Nine, eight, seven,'' Dr. Stone counted down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything's fine,'' said Mr. Zottarelli, flashing a thumbs up. ''You're on your own now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relief was written all over Ms. Dodd's face. ''It's not easy flying an old spacecraft,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her eyes moved to Dr. Stone, who was peering at a computer through his trifocals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are lots of old missions,'' he responded with a sly smile. ''But not many are doing exciting new things.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November will mark 50 years since India sent a rocket into space for the very first time, a research projectile that was launched from a quiet fishing village in southern India, terrifying many who prayed for pardon from their gods as they watched the orange vapor trail of the <span class="companylink">Nike</span>-Apache rocket climbing to an altitude of about 200 kilometers, or 125 miles. If everything goes according to plan, in November, as if in tribute to the origins of its space program, India will send a mission to Mars that will orbit the Red Planet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stated objectives of the 4.5 billion rupee, or $70 million, mission are to ascertain whether India can indeed send a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, and to study the planet's atmosphere and geology so that India could one day mine Mars and even send willing Indians there. And, of course, to detect evidence of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its very beginning, India's space program has attracted two extreme reactions -- that it is an important and honorable pursuit, which should make every Indian fiercely proud; and that it is a wasteful expenditure in a country where children die of starvation, a poor nation trying to compensate for its sense of smallness by assuming a phony machismo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, India's best-known cartoonist, R.K. Laxman, showed an average Indian being introduced to American space scientists as the best candidate to be sent to the moon. ''This is our man!'' the caption read. ''He can survive without water, food, light, air, shelter. ... ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That cartoon is not entirely irrelevant today, even as India is working on a project to send humans to space and bring them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's space scientists have consistently dismissed all questions about the value of their work as petty grudges of people who do not understand the value of their work. The scientists have considerable support among lay people, but even those who have affection for the space program find it hard to defend the Mars mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can India talk about mining Mars when the fact is that it depends on exploitative foreign companies to mine its own real estate on Earth for minerals in the first place? And if science must be a serious Indian pursuit at all, as it has to be in any nation, should not India focus all its resources on, say, mosquito-borne diseases that have killed millions of Indians? Space exploration in the time of dengue does seem baffling at first glance, but then should a nation really imagine that all its great ambitions should ideally line up according to a hierarchy of grave social importance and take up only one project at a time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramabhadran Aravamudan, who has now retired, joined the Indian space program more than five decades ago and was sent to the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> in the United States for training. He was in its Wallops Test Range the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and was baffled that NASA did not declare a holiday. He told me that even though writers have used the expression ''rocket science'' to mean a great, complex type of intelligence, ''rocket science is in many ways simpler than medical research and disease management. It is possible to have simple and clear goals in rocket science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, India's space scientists have long pointed out that the country's space program is not very expensive. This year the budget allocation to the Department of Space is 56.15 billion rupees. The travel bill for all <span class="companylink">Indian government</span> employees alone in 2011-12 was 35.19 billion rupees and is expected to be more now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program had impoverished beginnings by the Arabian Sea, inside a vacated Roman Catholic church in Thumba in southern India. So new and primitive was this science in India that its veterans are surprised it did not kill anyone. Once, three minutes before the scheduled launching of a small test rocket, a scientist pressed the siren switch to warn the local fishermen, as was the norm then, but the switch launched the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1960s, the founder of the Indian space program, Vikram A. Sarabhai, a hero in an age when scientists could be heroes even in India, learned that a new satellite telemetry and tracking station was being auctioned off as scrap in northern Australia. He sent two scientists to the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> to procure a blank foreign exchange demand draft. It was a time when it was almost impossible for Indians to take dollars out of the country, and the request for a blank demand draft seemed so ridiculous to one of the bank officials that he asked the two to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the very beginning until 2008, when India sent up a lunar orbiter that disappeared halfway into its intended mission life, the nation's space program was preoccupied with the practical task of launching cheap and locally made communications and weather satellites. The program also acquired a moral facade, which every major Indian science project is forced to acquire, of helping the poor. This the program did by using its satellites to connect remote Indian villages to the rest of the nation, and by being the eye in the sky during natural calamities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon and the Mars missions, as they did not have the ruse of immediate practical applications, had to face various forms of criticism, all of which raised the same familiar question: ''Why is a poor country doing this?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raj Chengappa, a journalist who has covered the space program for several years, is among those who find criticism of the program ''short-sighted.'' When the time comes for humanity to decide what on Mars belongs to whom, he told me, ''India has the chance to be at the high table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the criticism against the Mars mission is not so much an indictment of India's space program as it is a lament against India. The inescapable question is why does primary health care in India not have the sort of scientist-hero founder, the dedicated researchers and the extraordinary government support that its space program has enjoyed? Was it just that rocket science, despite what writers who majored in humanities imagine, truly is simpler than the war against the mosquito?</p>

In examining a dozen extreme weather events last year, scientists found signs that human activity contributed to about half of them. One of the most robust results was a much greater likelihood of heat waves like the one in the United States in July 2012. On the other hand, computer simulations indicated that the higher levels of carbon dioxide did not increase the odds of droughts like the one that affected much of the Midwest. In that case, the scientists said, it was just part of the natural cycles of weather.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people blame their genes for their weight. Now you may be able to blame the bacteria in your gut, too. Trillions of microbes live in the intestines of a healthy person, helping to digest foods. Researchers found pairs of human twins in which one was obese and the other was thin. They extracted gut bacteria from each of the twins and then injected them into the guts of laboratory mice. Mice with bacteria from a fat twin grew fat. Mice with bacteria from a thin twin stayed lean. Researchers said that they wanted to figure out which particular bacteria induced thinness, and those perhaps could be used in the future as a treatment for obesity. Also intriguing was that a change in diet could cause bacteria from a thin twin to crowd out the bacteria from a fat twin, causing the fat mouse to lose weight. But the opposite never occurred.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe last moon mission on NASA's current schedule -- a small, unmanned spacecraft that will study moon dust and the lunar atmosphere -- is scheduled to launch on Friday from Wallops Island, Va., elating scientists who study the moon but highlighting political questions about what NASA should do next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Smart Car-size spacecraft, which NASA calls the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer, will take 30 days to get into orbit around the moon, spend the next 30 days checking its equipment and proceed with scientific work for 100 days, searching for water molecules in the atmosphere and gathering data about the curious substance known as lunar dust. Then the probe, which goes by the acronym Ladee (pronounced laddie), will take a death plunge into the rocky surface of the subject it is studying.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the scientific program could be helpful in preparing for future manned missions to the moon. Although NASA currently does not have such plans, some members of Congress have called on the space agency to return to the moon rather than pursuing its current space objectives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there is wide agreement that NASA should ultimately aim for a manned flight to Mars, that goal is far off. The more immediate plan, which has been criticized on Capitol Hill, is to capture an asteroid and tow it closer to home so astronauts can visit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA has continued sending unmanned spacecraft to the moon; the coming mission will be the third to go there in five years. While scientists are excited about what the experiment may yield, they are also concerned about the absence of future moon voyages on NASA's schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to fly this mission with the goal of understanding the atmosphere and how dust might affect future human missions, and you don't have the future human missions, then part of the reason for the mission disappears,'' said David Kring, senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, a NASA-financed research institute in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if NASA sits on the sidelines, traffic to the moon will be busy. China announced last week that it would land its first exploratory rover on the moon by the end of the year. India, Japan, Russia and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> also have unmanned missions in the works. And <span class="companylink">Google</span> is sponsoring a competition called the Lunar X Prize, offering up to $20 million to the first company that can send a robotic spacecraft to the moon by 2015 and make it perform certain tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ladee spacecraft was conceived when NASA was also planning new manned missions to the moon, which would have been the first since 1972. But the Obama administration canceled that program, called Constellation, in 2010, calling it over budget and behind schedule. Ladee stayed in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will search for water in the very thin lunar atmosphere, which is estimated to be one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, perhaps similar to Mercury's. Scientists want to find out how the ice on the moon's poles managed to get there, said Richard Elphic, project scientist for the mission. They speculate that water molecules in the moon's atmosphere may have migrated toward the poles and frozen in place, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of water below the moon's surface was discovered in recent years by a NASA-financed instrument aboard an Indian spacecraft, Chandrayaan-1. Data collected from the coming mission could help complete the picture of the moon's water cycle, Dr. Elphic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter will also examine the movements of lunar dust. ''Dust'' is a bit of a misnomer, the scientists said: the crushed debris is extremely fine but also has jagged, sharp edges, since there is no wind or water on the moon's surface to wear it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly more annoying than terrestrial dust,'' said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission. ''It's like shards of glass, and it sticks to everything. If it gets into your eyes or your skin, it's abrasive and it hurts. It also really gums up machinery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dust poses a risk to robots and humans alike, as it can wreak havoc on equipment and spacesuits. Understanding the way the dust moves through the atmosphere will help scientists better prepare for longer missions on the moon, Dr. Elphic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone agrees that dust is a major concern. ''Dust on the lunar surface does not pose a serious risk to future lunar exploration,'' Dr. Kring said, pointing out that astronauts managed to survive the dust without major problems. But he still saw value in the dust inquiry, saying, ''We always want to reduce the risk, and to understand the dust phenomenon in and of itself is worthwhile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said the launching would break technological ground. Previously, spacecraft were custom-made for each mission and the models were not reusable. But this spacecraft was designed for assembly-line production, so that future missions could save money by using identical components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's design and construction cost $125 million out of a mission price of $250 million, said Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman. If the same design were used again, Mr. Brown said, NASA estimates that the cost would drop to $90 million for the first spacecraft and then over time to $55 million each. At the moment, though, NASA does not have other projects lined up to reuse the model, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will ride on the maiden voyage of the Minotaur V rocket built by the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, one of several private contractors NASA has turned to in recent years to supply rockets for its missions. The launching will be the first lunar mission for Orbital, as well as the first moon journey departing from Wallops Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009 and 2011, Orbital lost two NASA satellites in failed launching of its Taurus XL rocket, costing the agency more than $600 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this mission to succeed, Ladee will need to launch, separate from the Minotaur V, and insert itself into lunar orbit. Then, NASA will be able to begin its experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once we're on the moon, we'll breathe a big sigh of relief,'' Dr. Noble said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 12, 2014, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 19 about the crash landing on the moon of NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft, using information from NASA, misstated the density of the moon's atmosphere as compared with Earth's.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VENICE -- It is difficult to imagine a better use of 3D than in Alfonso Cuarón's ''Gravity,'' which opened the Venice Film Festival this year not just with a bang, but with a considerable quantity of space debris that the audience found hurtling toward them with alarming verisimilitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The out-of-competition film shown on Wednesday night stars Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone, a medical researcher, and George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky, a veteran astronaut on his last mission. They are on a routine space walk to repair the Hubble Telescope when, minutes into the film, an exploding Russian satellite sets off the space equivalent of a multicar pile-up. It shreds their shuttle craft and the telescope, leaving them floating in space several hundred miles above Earth, with only each other for company and a rapidly diminishing supply of oxygen.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie, scripted by Mr. Cuarón and his son Jonás, immediately sets the audience on edge -- you wonder not just how are they going to survive, but how are they going to manage to sustain this drama over an hour and a half. Yet sustain it they do, to dazzling effect. It is difficult to give more plot details without revealing any of the twists and turns of this gripping and visually stunning drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gravity'' is a surprising hybrid, a sci-fi disaster movie, but an intimate one. It has balletic qualities that go way beyond Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' with which it will inevitably be compared. The pyrotechnic effects in this movie could only have been achieved with the latest digital tools, but the Cuaróns' film remains a story that is centered on character and human emotions. It also has memorable moments of poetry -- a shimmering detached tear-drop traveling through space, for example -- and humor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bullock's performance is a bravura demonstration of ''grace under pressure,'' in a role that was clearly physically and mentally demanding. Her character has suffered a personal tragedy, but faced with the seemingly impossible challenge of maintaining her life she finds new untapped sources of strength and determination. She said at a news conference that while researching the part she had been in regular contact with astronauts on the International Space Station. One shudders to think of the size of her telephone bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Curran's in-competition ''Tracks'' also has a female lead and is firmly rooted in a study of character. The film is based on the true story of the Australian Robyn Davidson, who in 1975 set out alone on a 2,700-kilometer, or 1,700-mile, journey through one of the most hostile environments on Earth, from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean, with three camels and her Labrador. Dissatisfied with the lack of purpose and direction in her life in the city, this daring enterprise was a quest of a very private nature, and she was taken aback when her exploit became world news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In refreshing contrast to today's celebrity-seeking culture, she had severe misgivings about agreeing to let the National Geographic photographer Rick Smolan (played by Adam Driver) meet her at several stages along the route to record her progress in exchange for the sponsorship without which she could not have made the trip. The account she was subsequently encouraged to write became a worldwide best seller and a staple in Australian schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has long been talk of turning this modern Australian epic into a movie, but it has taken nearly 40 years to bring it to the big screen. In fact, so much time has elapsed that the movie records some aspects of Australian and Aboriginal life that have since changed considerably. It is also something of a nostalgic document of a pre-GPS era -- when disappearing into the wilderness for weeks on end was still possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although born in the United States, Mr. Curran spent many years in Australia and made his first film there. He shot it in the Outback, often in arduous circumstances, and Mandy Walker's cinematogaphy, using a special 35-millimeter film, does full justice to the continent's awe-inspiring desertscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian Mia Wasikowska is perfectly cast as Ms. Davidson and plays the remarkable adventurer with skill, conviction and sensitivity. There is, too, a splendid cameo performance by Rolley Mintuma as an Aboriginal elder who guided and befriended Ms. Davidson on one of the most hazardous parts of her journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10th edition of the Venice Days sidebar category got off to a strong start with the screening of Yuri Adler's ''Bethlehem,'' in Arabic and Hebrew and co-scripted with Ali Waked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this thriller set in Jerusalem and the West Bank, Razi (Tsahi Halevy) is an Israeli police agent who has managed to recruit a young Arab boy, Sanfur (Shadi Mar'i), as an informant in Bethlehem. Sanfur's older brother, Abu Ibrahim (Tarek Copti), has become a militant high up on the Israelis' hit list, and Razi and his colleagues now seem on the verge of being able to use Sanfur to entrap and assassinate him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an almost paternal bond has grown up between Sanfur and Razi, which Razi's boss becomes increasingly worried might sabotage the ambush that is intended to prevent Ibrahim from carrying out another deadly attack in Jerusalem. The murky world of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and the vicious circle of suspicion and betrayal in which all the players are locked, are well drawn in this gritty, suspenseful drama as the action moves toward its inevitably violent denouement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first of three Italian films to be shown in competition was Emma Dante's ''Via Castellana Bandiera'' (A Street in Palermo). In this adaptation of her own novel, Ms. Dante herself plays one of the leading roles as Rosa, a Palermo native, who, much against her better judgement, has returned to the Sicilian city with her partner, Clara (Alba Rohrwacher), for a wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They take a wrong turn and find themselves in a narrow street in a poor neighborhood head-to-head with a beat-up vehicle driven by an evidently batty old woman, Samira (Lena Cotta). She is driving her extended, noisy -- and disappointingly stereotypical -- Sicilian family home from the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Rosa nor Samira will back down and the stand-off soon takes on ludicrous (and implausible) proportions as day turns into night and the neighbors start betting on which of the women will be the first to throw in the towel. Unfortunately, the filmmaker seems to have little more of an idea of how to extract herself from this impasse than the characters she has created.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching rocket and other components for the Chang'e-3 lunar probe, named after a goddess in Chinese mythology who flew to the moon, have already been assembled and tested, Xinhua reported, citing a meeting of the Chinese lunar exploration program.</p>

''The technology is complicated and extremely difficult, with huge risks and great responsibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will build on China's two previous Chang'e lunar exploration efforts: a craft launched in 2007 that orbited the moon, and another launched in 2010 that did the same and then embarked on deep-space exploration and tests. Chinese space engineers have also speculated about eventually attempting a manned mission to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China sees establishing a long-term presence in space as an important part of its emergence as a global power. This year, it sent three Chinese astronauts into orbit for a 15-day mission that included exercises in docking, an important skill needed to build and maintain a manned space station. China first sent an astronaut into space in 2003. The latest report did not give a specific date for the Chang'e-3 launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States, which landed astronauts on the moon starting in 1969, plans to launch its latest lunar probe on Sept. 6. The unmanned probe is meant to study lunar dust.</p>

Astronomers spotted a planet that circles its star in a little more than eight hours, a well-preserved bog mummy found in Ireland is at least 4,000 years old, and marine scientists discovered a new species of clam that lives among the spines of sea urchins in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler Space Telescope found a planet 700 light-years from Earth that orbits its sun in a little over eight hours. It is about the size of Earth and so hot -- 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- that it's molten, and scientists are calling it a ''lava planet.'' Kepler-78b, as it is named, is about 100 times closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. Scientists were relieved to find that the Kepler telescope could still detect a planet, even though two of the wheels that control its orientation have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egyptology: Space Jewels</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earliest known iron artifacts are Egyptian beads dated to about 3200 B.C. Now researchers using advanced X-ray techniques and neutron radiography have determined that these beads were made not by smelting iron ore, a technology developed later, but from meteorites, pounded into thin sheets and rolled into tubes. The beads, which contain nickel and cobalt as well as iron, were included on necklaces along with gold and lapis lazuli, suggesting that the ancient Egyptians found them highly valuable, according to the study, in The Journal of Archaeological Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment: Climate Warming Confirmed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new United Nations climate report -- the fifth since 1988 -- has concluded that the basic facts about global warming are beyond question: it is caused by human activity and if it continues it will lead to melting of land ice, extreme heat waves, difficulty in growing food, and dramatic changes in plant and animal life, including large numbers of extinctions. The new document is not final, but experts expect the essential findings will survive review.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''bog body'' found in Ireland in 2011 -- one of more than 100 mummified remains that have been found in bogs around the world -- has now been dated with radiocarbon tests to 2000 B.C., The Irish Times reported. It is the oldest body ever discovered in Europe with the skin still intact. The young adult male, found in the Cul Na Mona Bog in Cashel, County Laois, probably met a violent end, possibly in a ritual sacrifice. He had a broken arm and there were cuts in his back apparently inflicted with a knife. Scientists plan to analyze the contents of the man's stomach to determine his diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marine Science: There's Waldo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoologists have discovered a new species of clam on the Pacific Coast that lives on the spines of sea urchins. Its shell is thin and fragile, and the animal is about 2/10 of an inch across. Called Waldo arthuri, it, like most clams, is a hermaphrodite. Unlike many other clams, though, it can move on its own by lifting its shell over its body and sliding along the ocean bottom. Scientists think it snuggles up to sea urchins for protection, but they are not sure what the sea urchins get out of this intimate relationship they told National Geographic.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, which would you rather do: Capture an asteroid or go back to the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is one of the many interesting issues facing Congress that we probably will not have time to debate once Congress actually comes back next month. Then it'll be nothing but Obamacare and government shutdowns and the occasional discussion about whether Senator Ted Cruz has managed to dispose of his recently discovered dual Canadian citizenship.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which I am personally looking forward to a lot. But today let's consider the American space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space exploration is one of the extremely few areas in which there is a lot of bipartisan agreement in Washington. For instance, both parties believe that the United States should be trying to get to Mars. Eventually. Nobody thinks this will happen anytime soon -- partly because the technology is so challenging and partly because Congress keeps cutting the space budget. So far, NASA has not shown any interest in the tactic being used by a Dutch company that hopes to establish a Martian colony in about 10 years, with money that would come in part from producing a reality series, somewhere along the lines of ''Big Brother" or perhaps ''Real Housewives of the Red Planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third point of wide bipartisan agreement is that nobody wants their constituents to be clobbered by an asteroid. Really, this is a priority. The Obama administration is currently promoting an ''asteroid grand challenge,'' in which we're invited ''to find all asteroid threats to human populations'' and figure out what to do about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And -- this is good news, people -- we've already pinpointed about 95 percent of all the rocks in the solar system that are of planet-mashing size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know that you are now instantly focusing on the remaining 5 percent, as well as the multitudinous smaller fellows that are capable of taking out Massachusetts or Paris -- or your local shopping center. Everybody is in favor of finding them too, particularly since one grazed Russia earlier this year, causing the House Science Committee to hold a special Threats From Space meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even members of Congress who pooh-pooh the peril of global warming believe in the danger of global asteroid-exploding. I am thinking about Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads -- yes! -- the House Science Committee. And Sen. Ted Cruz, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Subcommittee on Science and Space, who demanded that we ''do what needs to be done'' to prevent an asteroid from hitting the earth and smashing into a major American city. Or a Canadian one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all this cheerleading, there hasn't been all that much money spent on the mission. Discover magazine estimated that over the past 15 years, the United States had spent less money on asteroid detection ''than the production budget of the 1998 asteroid movie 'Armageddon.' '' In which Ben Affleck won Liv Tyler but the earth lost Shanghai, much of New York and Bruce Willis. But we were talking about capturing asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is what NASA should do during the really, really long pre-Mars interlude. The White House wants to send an unmanned spacecraft to capture a smallish asteroid, tow it back and put it into orbit around the moon, where we could send astronauts to study it. This would most definitely help us in the race to develop the best ''capture bag,'' and there's pretty wide agreement we would acquire some other useful technology as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This would be the first time humans have, in some sense, rearranged the solar system for their own purposes. So that's exciting,'' said Prof. Tom Prince, director of the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not as far as the House of Representatives is concerned. The Science Committee recently voted to cut all the money for asteroid capture and invest it instead in a new moon landing. There were several objections to the Obama plan, the main one being that it was kind of boring. ''Costly and uninspiring,'' sniffed Chairman Smith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House position was that if you wanted to talk about boring, look at a moon landing. ''Going back to the moon, something we have done six times, just does not seem to us worth the investment,'' said Lori Garver, NASA deputy administrator, in a phone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And anyway, what about protecting the earth from a killer asteroid? I believe I speak for all of us when I say that space exploration is good, but not being hit by a large hunk of galactic rock is even better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House Republicans could have a point. The asteroid that NASA wants to capture would be way smaller than Killer Visitor dimensions. Although it does seem a little peculiar that they're calling for a dramatic moon-colony initiative at the same time they're cutting the space budget.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An international panel of scientists has found with near certainty that human activity is the cause of most of the temperature increases of recent decades, and warns that sea levels could conceivably rise by more than three feet by the end of the century if emissions continue at a runaway pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists, whose findings are reported in a draft summary of the next big United Nations climate report, largely dismiss a recent slowdown in the pace of warming, which is often cited by climate change doubters, attributing it most likely to short-term factors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report emphasizes that the basic facts about future climate change are more established than ever, justifying the rise in global concern. It also reiterates that the consequences of escalating emissions are likely to be profound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010,'' the draft report says. ''There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draft comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of several hundred scientists that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, along with Al Gore. Its summaries, published every five or six years, are considered the definitive assessment of the risks of climate change, and they influence the actions of governments around the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions, for instance, largely on the basis of the group's findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming report will be the fifth major assessment from the group, created in 1988. Each report has found greater certainty that the planet is warming and greater likelihood that humans are the primary cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2007 report found ''unequivocal'' evidence of warming, but hedged a little on responsibility, saying the chances were at least 90 percent that human activities were the cause. The language in the new draft is stronger, saying the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the principal cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On sea level, which is one of the biggest single worries about climate change, the new report goes well beyond the assessment published in 2007, which largely sidestepped the question of how much the ocean could rise this century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report also reiterates a core difficulty that has plagued climate science for decades: While averages for such measures as temperature can be predicted with some confidence on a global scale, the coming changes still cannot be forecast reliably on a local scale. That leaves governments and businesses fumbling in the dark as they try to plan ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another closely watched issue, the scientists retreated slightly from their 2007 position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the question of how much the planet could warm if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere doubled, the previous report largely ruled out any number below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The new draft says the rise could be as low as 2.7 degrees, essentially restoring a scientific consensus that prevailed from 1979 to 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the draft says only that the low number is possible, not that it is likely. Many climate scientists see only a remote chance that the warming will be that low, with the published evidence suggesting that an increase above 5 degrees Fahrenheit is more likely if carbon dioxide doubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is up 41 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and if present trends continue it could double in a matter of decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warming the entire planet by 5 degrees Fahrenheit would add a stupendous amount of energy to the climate system. Scientists say the increase would be greater over land and might exceed 10 degrees at the poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They add that such an increase would lead to widespread melting of land ice, extreme heat waves, difficulty growing food and massive changes in plant and animal life, probably including a wave of extinctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new document is not final and will not become so until an intensive, closed-door negotiating session among scientists and government leaders in Stockholm in late September. But if the past is any guide, most of the core findings of the document will survive that final review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The document was leaked over the weekend after it was sent to a large group of people who had signed up to review it. It was first reported on in detail by the Reuters news agency, and The New York Times obtained a copy independently to verify its contents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does no original research, but instead periodically assesses and summarizes the published scientific literature on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draft document ''is likely to change in response to comments from governments received in recent weeks and will also be considered by governments and scientists at a four-day approval session at the end of September,'' the panel's spokesman, Jonathan Lynn, said in a statement Monday. ''It is therefore premature and could be misleading to attempt to draw conclusions from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After winning the Nobel Peace Prize six years ago, the group became a political target for climate doubters, who helped identify minor errors in the 2007 report. This time, the panel adopted rigorous procedures in the hope of preventing such mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some climate doubters challenge the idea that the earth is warming at all; others concede that it is, but deny human responsibility; still others acknowledge a human role, but assert that the warming is likely to be limited and the impacts manageable. Every major scientific academy in the world has warned that global warming is a serious problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel shifted to a wider range for the potential warming, dropping the plausible low end to 2.7 degrees, after a wave of recent studies saying higher estimates were unlikely. But those studies are contested, and scientists at Stockholm are likely to debate whether to stick with that language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said he feared the intergovernmental panel, in writing its draft, had been influenced by criticism from climate doubters, who advocate even lower numbers. ''I think the I.P.C.C. on this point has once again erred on the side of understating the degree of the likely changes,'' Dr. Mann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Christopher B. Field, a researcher at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> who serves on the panel but was not directly involved in the new draft, said the group had to reflect the full range of plausible scientific views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that the I.P.C.C. has a tradition of being very conservative,'' Dr. Field said. ''They really want the story to be right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the likely rise in sea level over the coming century, the new report lays out several possibilities. In the most optimistic, the world's governments would prove far more successful at getting emissions under control than they have been in the recent past, helping to limit the total warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that circumstance, sea level could be expected to rise as little as 10 inches by the end of the century, the report found. That is a bit more than the eight-inch increase in the 20th century, which proved manageable even though it caused severe erosion along the world's shorelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other extreme, the report considers a chain of events in which emissions continue to increase at a swift pace. Under those conditions, sea level could be expected to rise at least 21 inches by 2100 and might increase a bit more than three feet, the draft report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of millions of people live near sea level, and either figure would represent a challenge for humanity, scientists say. But a three-foot rise in particular would endanger many of the world's great cities -- among them New York; London; Shanghai; Venice; Sydney, Australia; Miami; and New Orleans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an enormous black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and, given its size, scientists have long wondered why it doesn't grow faster and consume more than it does. Now, radio astronomers have discovered an elderly, rapidly rotating star known as a pulsar in the vicinity of the black hole, called Sagittarius A, that is providing some clues, reported Nature. By observing the pulsar's behavior, researchers have deduced that Sagittarius A generates a surprisingly strong magnetic field that may slow its intake of stellar material.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two teams of physicists have successfully teleported tiny bits of information from one side of a computer chip to the other, reported National Geographic. The process involved two quantum bits, one on the sender side of the chip, and one on the receiving end. Because the bits were ''entangled,'' to use a quantum physics term, what happened to one happened to the other. So when data was written to the sender side of the chip, it would leap to the receiving side without passing through the space between. The research could potentially improve computing and encryption speeds.</p>

The study, based on new ice records, suggests that the same pattern played out during the thaw from Earth's last big ice age. The ice sheet over West Antarctica started heating up 20,000 to 22,000 years ago, earlier than previously thought. But East Antarctica, which was higher and colder, was in a deep freeze until 18,000 years ago.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">="series-lang"&gt;Man-made perils to the universe's garden of life are evident from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1961, Yuri A. Gagarin, the first man to orbit the Earth, issued his initial impressions from an altitude of more than 100 miles. The sky was deep black, he said, and the Earth's horizon crowned with ''a beautiful blue halo.'' Between bright white clouds, he enthused, he could make out ''snow, forest, mountains.'' It was an Edenic picture.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the subsequent depths of the cold war, with nuclear weapons racing off the assembly lines of the Soviet Union and the United States, succeeding cosmonauts and astronauts contributed their own observations. Like Mr. Gagarin, they found their world mesmerizingly beautiful. They also reported a singularly intriguing fact: no borders or political boundaries could be seen from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, few signs of humanity were visible, at least on the sunlit side. Sure, Los Angeles was visibly smoggy. And irrigated cropland could sometimes be discerned, like pointillism on Nile Delta sand. But these were exceptions. Under a startlingly thin layer of atmosphere, vast expanses of desert ceded to forests that gave way to the oceans that make up 70 percent of Earth's surface. The planet seemed largely untouched. Only at night, when jewel-like cities rotated into view, did clear signs of civilization emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was something profoundly reassuring about this. Even as the ICBMs slept, it was heartening to know that despite our best efforts, we had not yet banged up the biosphere enough to make the effects easily visible from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those were the 1960s and early '70s; the global population was half what it is today, and the portion driving cars and leaving the lights on was far lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrast that with the last decade or so, when astronauts and Earth-observing satellites have recorded a different, deeply unsettling picture. While our world remains ravishingly beautiful, it increasingly shows symptoms of distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these indicators are the direct result of human activity. Others are the indirect consequence of using our atmosphere as a dumping ground for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a dispassionate quality to the view from on high. On Aug. 2, 2005, the circuitous trajectory of Messenger, a NASA spacecraft, brought it boomeranging back toward Earth on its way to explore Mercury. Its steady stream of data offered a rare chance to watch our world grow larger in space, as a visitor from another star system might first see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, Earth was simply a pearl of milky white and ultramarine blue, with the white -- clouds, ice and snow -- being other forms of life-giving water. Eventually, hues of tawny gold appeared; more than a third of the visible land area, it seemed, was desert. Only later, when the planet filled half the picture plane, did a hint of emerald emerge between the clouds. A verdant, compelling green. The color of photosynthesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After this first direct evidence of life on Earth, and with the spacecraft still a quarter of the distance to the Moon, another hue emerged. Above the lush equatorial belt of South America, lower in altitude and distinct from the clouds, it was a nebulous, smoky, profoundly unsettling gray-blue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could this be from fires, perhaps willfully set? Could this first hint of intelligent life on Earth signify a species evidently busy creating still more desert?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You already know the answer. August is the driest month in the Amazon River basin -- the best time for subsistence farmers and owners of large tracts of land to clear acreage for agriculture by burning off forests that sequester carbon dioxide and replenish oxygen in our overcarbonized atmosphere. Although the deforestation rate in Brazil has slowed since 2005, it never stopped entirely and may be rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, much the same is happening in that other remaining repository of invaluable equatorial forest, Indonesia -- particularly on the island of Sumatra, where similar glimpses show jungle being burned off annually to clear land for palm oil production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this was the view from some 65,000 miles away. Far closer in, NASA maintains a small fleet of Earth-observing satellites. Unfortunately, their visual record makes it even clearer that something is going badly wrong in the garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the world, tremendous wildfires can be seen raging during the searing summers of the new millennium. As the oceans warm, vast equatorial hurricanes have smashed North America. In Canada, the Northwest Passage has twice become clear of ice during the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the smog is no longer localized. A gunmetal exhalation of coal and fuel smoke blankets China almost daily, extending out across the sea toward the Korean Peninsula, Japan and beyond. We are tracking glaciers retreating, and immense polar icebergs calving into rising waters. Gargantuan sandstorms extend out from expanding deserts, sometimes traversing the breadth of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the images from NASA's flagship Terra and Aqua satellites are downright heartbreaking. They seem to make the case that we're inexplicably intent on engineering our own expulsion from the garden, in a kind of late-breaking, self-inflicted Old Testament dismissal. But as five decades of space exploration make clear, there are no other worlds even remotely suitable for human life -- at least not in this solar system. We simply have no other place to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mid-Pliocene epoch, some three million years ago, was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide was at the levels we are now approaching; some scientists estimate that mid-latitude temperatures then were between 16 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than today, and sea levels may have been up to 115 feet higher. In our own era in the 48 contiguous states, according to the <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 7 of the 10 warmest years since 1901 have occurred since 1998. Welcome to the Anthropocene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's speech in June, promising action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was welcome, if belated. It may be the best he can do domestically. But nobody pretends it is adequate to the onrushing disaster. Having dodged the bullet of cold war nuclear annihilation, we face a new threat just as global, man-made and potentially lethal. A sense of emergency is what is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama should invite world leaders to an emergency conclave in Washington as early as possible and challenge China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and other major greenhouse-gas emitters to equal or exceed the percentage reductions he seeks for the United States. He should also try to rally the nation and globe in support of an international Manhattan Project, in which the best scientific minds would devise carbon-sequestration technologies that could clean the air of the heating elements we've put there -- rather than simply seeking to limit the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having constructed a civilization capable of observing our still paradisiacal world from objectivity-inducing distances, we need to set aside our squabbles, recognize that we face a species-wide threat, and use our scientific-technical genius to protect the only known home of life in the universe.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHROUDED by foliage and separated from the city by the Hudson River, the looming cliffs of the Palisades mean little more to most New Yorkers than a pleasant view from the West Side Highway. But these titanic ramparts of ancient basalt are also monuments to an apocalypse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cliffs were once underground channels of molten rock that fed widespread volcanic eruptions 200 million years ago as the supercontinent Pangaea pulled apart at the seams. The eruptions covered more than four million square miles with basalt lava and belched vast amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur into the atmosphere. Brief volcanic winters followed, but the eruptions also set off an ocean-acidifying, global-warming catastrophe that wiped out three-quarters of life on earth. This was the end-Triassic extinction, which cleared the way for the dinosaurs and their domination of the planet for the next 136 million years, before a giant asteroid struck Mexico and ended their reign.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, a team of researchers from <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> and the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> published a paper in the journal Science connecting these eruptions -- which took place in four pulses over 600,000 years -- with this global near-death experience, one of five major extinctions over the last 540 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul E. Olsen, a paleontologist at Columbia and one of the study's co-authors, recently took me on a tour of the Palisades. Before we left, he showed me a fossil that he and his 12-year-old son found on a beach in Haverstraw, N.Y., along the Hudson -- the imprint of a clumsy-looking five-knuckled foot. It was made by a species of crocodilian reptile, a rauisuchian, the dominant predator before the volcanic cataclysm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can find fish and reptile fossils here by the hundreds, were the rock not so hard,'' he said as we hiked to a point up from the Ross Dock Picnic Area, just north of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J., where the base of the Palisades meets older sedimentary rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area was once part of a huge tropical rift valley created as the continent cleaved apart. The patterns of colors on these sedimentary rocks -- from black and thinly striated to red-brown -- are markers of an ancient lake that alternated from deep to shallow in 20,000-year cycles controlled by the wobble of the earth's axis and the amount of sunlight hitting the planet. Professor Olsen discovered that the first wave of the extinction happened within just a single sedimentary layer, in less than 20,000 years, as atmospheric carbon dioxide likely doubled from the eruptions, sending global temperatures soaring by 3 degrees Celsius or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We dodged a car rushing along a park road as we continued our hike. Behind us, through a thicket of bittersweet and porcelainberry, I spotted the outline of New York City. We're living in the Anthropocene, the newly named geologic epoch dominated by man. The city is a churning symbol of this new age, a metabolic node of the human superorganism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists believe we are now in the midst of another great extinction, driven not by natural events but by the activities of man: hunting, habitat destruction, the introduction of invasive species and pollution, which has drastically altered the thin glaze of life-supporting chemistry that coats the earth. By some estimates, perhaps close to 30,000 species of plants and animals go extinct every year. Whole ecosystems, like coral reefs, which went virtually extinct in the end-Triassic extinction, are now facing worldwide collapse again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> report last fall warned that ''present emission trends put the world plausibly on a path toward 4 degrees Celsius warming within the century.'' The surface waters of the carbon-dioxide absorbing oceans have already become 30 percent more acidic since the start of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In terms of global warming and ocean acidification,'' Professor Olsen said, the rate of change during the end-Triassic extinction ''was comparable to what we're doing today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I looked up the cliffs I wondered what we would leave to the ages. If catastrophe strikes, would future geologists find evidence of New York, a marker for our time, just as the Palisades have survived as a tombstone for another era?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' he said. ''It would be eroded away fairly quickly.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said Thursday that its celebrated planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft, which broke down in May when a reaction wheel that controls its pointing failed, could not be fixed and would never again search for planets around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing news brings to an end, for now, one phase of the most romantic of space dreams, the search for other Earths among the exoplanets of the Milky Way. NASA has already asked astronomers for ideas on how to use the hobbled spacecraft, whose telescope is in perfect shape.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as they mourned the end of Kepler, astronomers said its legacy would continue as they worked their way through a trove of data the spacecraft has gathered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last count, Kepler had discovered 3,548 possible planets, and 135 of them -- some smaller than the Earth -- have been validated by other observations, including earthbound telescopes. But hundreds or thousands more are in the pipeline, said William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., Kepler's originator and principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most exciting discoveries are going to come in the next few years as we search through this data,'' Mr. Borucki said on Thursday in a telephone news conference. ''In the next few years we're going to be able to answer the questions that inspired Kepler: Are Earthlike planets common or rare in the galaxy?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched into an orbit around the Sun in March 2009. Its official mission was to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that harbor Earthlike planets by carrying out a survey of some 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of their suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three dips, or transits, are considered the criteria for a planet candidate, which means the Earth or a planet in a similar orbit that was habitable would take three years to show up. Accordingly, Kepler was designed to operate for four years, but other sunlike stars turned out to be more jittery in their output than expected, making the detection of Earth analogues more difficult. Since astronomers could learn a lot more from Kepler if it went on collecting data, the decision was made last year to extend the spacecraft's mission for three more years, until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far Kepler's mission has cost $600 million, and its budget for the 2013 fiscal year is about $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its finds were a planet nicknamed Tatooine, after the ''Star Wars'' planet with two suns, otherwise known as Kepler 16b, the first one found that orbits two stars at once. Another was the so-called Styrofoam planet, which is again half as large as Jupiter but so puffed up by the heat of its star that it is only one-tenth as dense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest Kepler has come to finding another Earth was in April, when the team discovered a pair of planets about half again as big as the Earth orbiting a yellow star, now known as Kepler 62, that is 1,200 light years away. Both planets reside in the ''Goldilocks'' zone where temperatures should be lukewarm and suitable for liquid water and thus life as we imagine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, however, Kepler was already in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to do its job of precisely monitoring starlight, Kepler has to keep pointing accurately enough so that each star in the field of view stays on the same pixel in the detector, equivalent to pinpointing a soccer ball in Central Park as seen from San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels, essentially gyroscopes, of which three are needed to keep it pointed. Last summer, one wheel showed signs of too much friction and was shut down. A second wheel failed in May, putting the spacecraft into safe mode and jeopardizing the exoplanet search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers began to sing dirges. Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, dashed off a poem, which said, in part, ''Let jet airplanes circle at night overhead/ Sky-writing over Cygnus: Kepler is dead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers spent several months trying to resurrect Kepler's pointing ability. ''We had very little hope it was actually going to be recoverable,'' said Charles Sobeck, a Kepler deputy project manager, who compared the problem to a stuck wheel on a supermarket shopping cart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They managed to get both faulty reaction wheels spinning again, but with too much friction. Last week, when they tried to make the spacecraft point, it went into safe mode after a few hours, making it clear that Kepler's planet-hunting days were over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe they left no stone unturned,'' said Paul Hertz, NASA's director of astrophysics, in the news conference announcing the end of the rescue effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now pondering ways in which the telescope can be used with two reaction wheels. In one mode, stars would drift across the detector ''like a lost nomadic tribe migrating across the Sahara,'' in the words of Dr. Marcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letters looking for ideas have gone out to astronomers, and NASA might eventually convene a review panel to consider future Kepler operations in competition with other science projects, Dr. Hertz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, astronomers continue to pore over the flood of data that is still in the Kepler pipeline. Mr. Borucki -- speaking with the relentless optimism of a man who spent 20 years getting Kepler designed, approved and into space -- said that Kepler could still perform its prime directive of measuring the frequency of Earthlike planets in the galaxy, albeit with poorer statistical certainty than he would have liked. It would take about three more years of data analysis, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going have to dig down hard to find those planets -- we know we can do it,'' Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he conceived the mission 20 years ago, he said, no one knew if there were any planets out there in the galaxy. ''Now at the completion,'' he said, ''we know our galaxy is filled to the brim with planets. When you look up at the sky and see it filled with stars, most of those stars have planets.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They won't be the first cameras out there, of course. Earth-imaging satellites the size of vans have long circled the globe, but those cost millions of dollars each to build and launch, in part because of their weight and specialized hardware. The new satellites, with some of the same off-the-shelf miniaturized technology that has made smartphones and laptops so powerful, will be far less expensive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view from high up is rich in untapped data, said Paul Saffo, a forecaster and essayist. He expects the new satellite services to find many customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies, for example, could use the satellites' ''before'' and ''after'' views to monitor insured property and validate claims after a disaster. Businesses that update online maps for geologists, city planners or disaster relief officials could be customers, too. The images could also be used to monitor problems like deforestation, melting icecaps and overfishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And food companies and commodities traders could use the images to keep track of crops and agricultural yields all over the planet, Mr. Saffo predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the images are also likely to be viewed as the latest mixed blessing by people already apprehensive of Big Brother-like surveillance in their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First into space in the microsatellite business will be the San Francisco company Planet Labs, which plans to launch a fleet of 28 small satellites at the end of the year that will photograph the planet around the clock, with frequent updates. The company has already sent up two trial satellites for test runs, and will dispatch the entire set, called Flock-1, in December, said Will Marshall, a co-founder of the company and a former NASA scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Planet Labs' satellites won't be able to distinguish your face or read your license plate -- the cameras don't have that level of resolution. But the frequency with which images can be updated could raise privacy questions, said Timothy Edgar, a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at <span class="companylink">Brown University</span> and a former director of privacy and civil liberties in the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Edgar contrasted the satellite images with those provided by <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth -- the ones that people zoom in on to see, for example, an aerial view of their homes.''That's just an image of your house that was probably taken a few years ago,'' he said. ''It may feel like you are being watched, but you aren't. It's just a static picture that's most likely several years old.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a satellite that regularly passes over your cabin deep in the woods and photographs a car that is sometimes parked there -- and sometimes not -- has different ramifications. ''It can show a pattern, for example, when you appear to be at home and when you're away,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planet Labs' technology, like that at other microsatellite companies such as Skybox Imaging, are benefiting from the progressive miniaturization of consumer electronic components, along with a federal effort to commercialize space. ''What we are seeing are smaller satellites that have similar capabilities to much larger, traditional satellites,'' said Glenn Lightsey, a professor at the University of Texas who founded and directs the Texas Spacecraft Lab there. ''Since putting a satellite in orbit is a function of its size, these new satellites are able to get into orbit at a much lower cost,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lightweight satellites have another advantage: the companies don't have to spend millions of dollars for a rocket to get them into space. Instead, they can hitch a ride as a secondary payload on a rocket already making the trip. Planet Labs will send its satellites on an Antares rocket when it heads out on a cargo transportation flight to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have flocked to the new satellite companies, though neither Planet Labs nor Skybox Imaging has disclosed what it will charge customers. Planet Labs has obtained $13.1 million in funding, led by Steve Jurvetson, managing director of <span class="companylink">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</span>. Other backers include <span class="companylink">O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures</span>, Data Collective and <span class="companylink">First Round Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five ground stations will receive the Planet Labs imagery as the satellites pass overhead. Dr. Marshall would not disclose how often the satellites would pass the same spot. ''The point is that by putting up lots of satellites, we can image the whole Earth on a much more frequent basis,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skybox Imaging, in Mountain View, Calif., aims to provide sharply detailed images as well as high-definition video with its satellites. The company, which has raised about $91 million, expects to put its SkySat-1 and SkySat-2 satellites into orbit later this year, said Dan Berkenstock, a co-founder, and then follow with a group totaling 24 satellites. Customers will be able to buy images or an appliance to download information directly from the satellite. ''They can log onto our satellite and ask it to take pictures,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan Space Imaging, a subsidiary of the <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Corporation</span>, recently signed a contract with Skybox allowing it to directly downlink imagery for agricultural and maritime monitoring as well as for disaster response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microsatellite services promise a new, accessible way to monitor global changes such as crop growth, said Anthony Janetos, director of Boston University's Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future. ''You can't understand these forces if you can't measure them,'' he said. ''These services will be useful in gathering those measurements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new satellites are yet another stage in the expansion of the human view aided by powerful cameras and digital communication, said Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at <span class="companylink">New York University</span> and author of ''The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This change has pluses and minuses, he observed. People who try to build a private hideaway in the woods might come to realize that it isn't so private. But such images could also spot illegal logging in remote spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we can have a Godlike view, looking down from the heavens,'' he said. ''I can understand why people would be nervous. But the cameras can make the world more transparent and open. I'm for that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori B. Garver, NASA's deputy administrator for the past four years, will leave next month to take the top staff position at the <span class="companylink">Air Line Pilots Association</span>, a union representing 50,000 pilots in the United States and Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's time to take on new challenges,'' Ms. Garver said in an interview on Tuesday. ''I feel like I've accomplished so many of the objectives I set out to do here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver, 52, who works at NASA headquarters in Washington, was often the public face -- and lightning rod for criticism -- of the Obama administration's efforts to push NASA in new directions. The White House wanted to cancel the program started under President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon, and scale back the agency's role in designing rockets and spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver, who previously worked both inside and outside of NASA, served as an adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. She switched to Mr. Obama's team after he won the nomination, and following the election she played a central role on the transition team for shaping NASA policy. In July 2009, the Senate confirmed Ms. Garver's appointment as NASA deputy administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She has been an indispensable partner in our efforts to keep NASA on a trajectory of progress and innovation,'' the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., wrote in an e-mail to NASA employees. ''In a time of great change and challenge, she has been a remarkable leader who has consistently shown great vision and commitment to NASA and the aerospace industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver advocated a greater for role for ''New Space'' -- the involvement of entrepreneurial companies, which many space advocates say they believe are more nimble and efficient than aerospace titans like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> that NASA has traditionally relied on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main goal was really to align NASA in a way that allowed them to be more sustainable and innovative in the 21st century,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some of the proposals received a cool, sometimes hostile, reception in Washington. Members of Congress in both parties complained that the plans often did not seem fully thought out, and that the administration did a poor job of explaining -- to the agency, lawmakers, contractors and the general public -- NASA's new mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 2011 budget proposal, the Obama administration sought to cancel the moon program and take a five-year hiatus on any development of rockets or spacecraft capable of taking astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit to more distant destinations like the moon, asteroids or Mars. Ms. Garver and other NASA officials argued that devoting the rocket money to more fundamental space technologies would actually speed future human exploration of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Democrats and Republicans were unconvinced and directed NASA to build a huge new rocket, now known as the Space Launch System, and a capsule, known as Orion, where astronauts would live during their excursions into deep space. The first flight with humans is scheduled for 2021, but so far, no consensus has emerged on where the new spacecraft should take NASA astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the legacies has been the decline and deterioration of relationships between the White House and Congress over the direction of space policy,'' said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span> and a space adviser to the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. ''She was part of it. I don't put sole blame on her. She was one of the more visible faces of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the administration did achieve several of its other goals, including turning to the private sector to provide transportation for astronauts going to and from the International Space Station. In the past, NASA designed and operated its spacecraft like the space shuttle, and it was a major cultural change within the agency to rely more on outsiders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was critical to reduce the cost of getting to and from space,'' Ms. Garver said. The effort, known as commercial crew, has NASA financing attempts by three commercial companies -- <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> and <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span> -- and she said it is ''clearly a goal that is now well, well established on its way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials also persuaded Congress to provide money for next-generation technologies like new propulsion systems and in-space fueling stations for spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not embarrassed at all by compromise,'' Ms. Garver said. ''That is something that this country can probably do a little more of these days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past few months, Ms. Garver has been advocating a proposal to capture a small asteroid and bring it into orbit around the moon for exploration by astronauts. NASA officials say the effort would have possible important side effects, like advancing ways to find asteroids with the potential to collide with Earth. They also say the robotic spacecraft that would capture the asteroid would demonstrate propulsion and solar cell technology that could later be deployed for a human mission to Mars, and the asteroid would provide an interesting destination for the astronauts on the first Space Launch System mission in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That proposal, too, has been met skeptically, with Republicans in the House of Representatives disliking it so much that they are seeking to explicitly prohibit NASA from pursuing it. They instead would like to revive the moon as the next destination for NASA astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver expressed some frustration that some in Congress want NASA to build the new rocket, but are not willing to let the space agency figure out how best to use it. ''It is disappointing where there is just an unwillingness to look at things on their merit,'' she said. ''We have put together a mission concept that really does take advantage of the very vehicle that Congress has funded for us to build.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDWho was it that first said that people are stardust?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people, of a certain age, might say Joni Mitchell, who sang, ''We are stardust, we are golden, and we've got to get ourselves back to the gar-ar-den,'' in her paean to the Woodstock festival. Others will say Carl Sagan, the author and host of ''Cosmos.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the answer goes back before those acolytes of beauty and consciousness were born. In 1929, the Harvard astronomer Harlow Shapley declared, ''We organic beings who call ourselves humans are made of the same stuff as the stars'' -- a remarkable observation, considering that at the time nobody even knew what made the stars shine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be 30 years before Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed in a classic paper that the atoms that compose us are not only the same as the ones in stars -- most of them were actually manufactured in stars. Starting from primordial hydrogen and helium, denser elements like iron, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen were built up in a series of thermonuclear reactions and then spewed into space when these stars died and exploded as supernovas in a final thermonuclear frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any gardener knows that ashes make good fertilizer. Our atoms were once in stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of all this by a pair of recent news items. One involved dung beetles, among the least lordly occupants of this cosmic garden, which apparently navigate by orienting themselves to the light of the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other was the announcement last month that astronomers had tentatively traced the existence of gold in the universe to a cataclysm known as a gamma-ray burst, which can light up a galaxy. As Joel Achenbach wrote in The Washington Post, ''The bling apparently begins with a blam.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blam in question happened -- or rather was noticed here on Earth -- on June 3. It was then that astronomers, alerted by a brief flash of high-energy gamma rays in the sky, think a pair of dead, ultradense neutron stars collided, leaving behind only a distant radioactive glow. Edo Berger of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> said the explosion could have created an amount of gold equivalent to the mass of 20 Earth Moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neutron stars are themselves a result of cataclysms, those supernova explosions that can squeeze the space out of atoms and compress a mass more than the Sun into a ball 10 miles across -- essentially a great ball of neutrons, hence the name. On Earth, a teaspoon of the stuff would weigh about five billion tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have always wondered whether ordinary supernova explosions could produce very heavy elements like gold, whose nucleus has 79 protons and 118 neutrons -- a far cry from the single proton that is a hydrogen nucleus. If a pair of neutron stars are in orbit around each other, they can collide -- a second cosmic act that will add to the universe's repertory of elements, the bling from blam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Dr. Berger and his colleagues suggested that all the gold in the universe might have been produced by neutron star collisions, which have been termed ''kilonova'' explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course we aspiring gardeners have other names for what is left behind after an object's energy has been metabolized into light and heat to nurture the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us back to the lowly dung beetle, the scarab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These creatures, which live on the feces of larger animals, have a problem. Once a beetle has found some dung and rolled part of it into a ball, he's got to get it out of there, rolling it in a straight line away from the dung pile, or the other beetles will come and poach it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How they manage this, even on moonless nights when obvious cues and landmarks are absent or invisible, has been a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last January a team of Swedish and South African researchers reported that African dung beetles, Scarabaeus satyrus, can use the Milky Way as their guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of experiments in a game preserve and a planetarium, a team led by Marie Dacke of Lund University in Sweden found that when the beetles were fitted with little caps that prevented them from seeing the sky or the stars were clouded out, the beetles wandered aimlessly, putting their little dung treasures at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a starlit sky, or just a dim band representing the disk of our humble home galaxy, is a enough to keep them on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although this is the first description of an insect using the Milky Way for their orientation, this ability might turn out to be widespread in the animal kingdom,'' the scientists wrote in Current Biology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to imagine a more beautiful or humbling connection between the sacred and the profane, the microscopic and the large, inner space and outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milky Way is one of nature's grandest creations: hundreds of billions of glittering stars, wreathed in ribbons of gas and dust, a cloudy, starry pinwheel so vast that a light beam would take 100,000 years to cross it and the Sun with its planetary entourage takes a quarter of a billion years to circle it once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is only one of countless galaxies, scattered like sand from here to eternity, rushing outward in the great expansion, whose meaning, if we are honest, is as fathomless to us as it is to a scarab pushing its carefully wrought investment portfolio through this garden of Earthy delights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarabs were sacred to the ancient Egyptians for their ability to create life from waste. They were a symbol of the eternal renewal of life from death, not unlike the waxing and the waning of the stars themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egyptians wore representations of them as amulets. And wouldn't you know, in one of the ultimate symbols of recycling, some of them were even gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 8, 2013, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the connections between stars, gold, dung beetles and people misspelled the term for explosions resulting from collisions of neutron stars. They are known as kilonova explosions, not kilanova.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first anniversary of its landing, halfway through its primary mission to Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover still has a long way to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be exact, 4.4 miles. That is the distance to the foothills of Mount Sharp, an 18,000-foot mountain whose rocks could provide clues to a time on Mars when life could have thrived.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Curiosity is driving at a careful pace -- up to 100 yards a day -- the journey will take eight or nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, science is secondary as Curiosity crawls across a barren, largely uninteresting landscape. ''Pretty much pure driving, pedal to the metal,'' said John P. Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interactive feature offers a chronology of where Curiosity has been and what it has done so far; new images and information will be added as the rover progresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to NASA, Curiosity has already traveled more than a mile, taken more than 36,700 images and fired 75,000 laser shots to analyze rocks and soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first day -- or sol, the term for a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth -- began in the early morning of Aug. 6, 2012. (At mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, it was late on Aug. 5.) The spacecraft carrying Curiosity pierced the top of the Martian atmosphere at more than 13,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In precisely choreographed maneuvers so risky that NASA called them ''seven minutes of terror,'' Curiosity was dropped to an undamaged standstill on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover, roughly the size of a car, ended up right where it had been aimed -- within Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide scar from an asteroid impact at least 3.5 billion years ago. In that time layers of sediment filled much of the crater, which were then somehow carved away, leaving Mount Sharp at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observations from orbit pointed to the presence of clay minerals at the base of the mountain, named in honor of Robert P. Sharp, a prominent geologist and Mars expert. Because clays form in water that has a neutral pH, that made Gale Crater a promising place to look for signs that Mars could have once been hospitable for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before it headed toward Mount Sharp, Dr. Grotzinger's team decided to send Curiosity on a detour to investigate terrain that looked to be an intriguing confluence of three different rock types. Along the way, Curiosity spotted what looked like an ancient streambed. At the site, in the first rock it drilled on Feb. 8 (Sol 182), it struck the jackpot -- clays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This rock in this part of Mars formed in watery conditions that were surprisingly Earthlike. ''Unquestionably, Mars was a habitable planet in its ancient past,'' Dr. Grotzinger said. Curiosity, however, does not have instruments that can directly search for life, past or present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the primary mission is scheduled for only two years, Curiosity could be exploring Mars far longer. ''It looks great,'' said Jennifer H. Trosper, the deputy project manager. ''I think over all the rover has worked better than expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lest anyone think that everything on the $2.5 billion mission would always work perfectly, a computer memory glitch in late February knocked Curiosity out of action for a couple of weeks. ''This is a very sober reminder that the rover ultimately has a finite lifetime,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is known, informally, as the asteroid-lasso plan: NASA wants to launch an unmanned spacecraft in 2018 that would capture a small asteroid -- maybe 7 to 10 yards wide -- haul it closer to Earth, then send astronauts up to examine it, in 2021 or beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the space agency has encountered a stubborn technical problem: Congressional Republicans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, there is bipartisan support (or disapproval) in Congress for NASA's bolder plans, particularly when they involve human spaceflight. What squabbling does take place tends to pit lawmakers from states with big NASA presences, like Florida and Texas, against those with fewer vested interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, however, the science committee in the Republican-controlled House voted to bar NASA from pursuing that faraway rock. In a straight party vote -- 22 Republicans for, 17 Democrats against -- the committee laid out a road map for NASA for the next three years that brushed aside the asteroid capture plan, the centerpiece of the Obama administration's agenda for space exploration. The plan, instead, included new marching orders, telling NASA to send astronauts back to the Moon, set up a base there and then aim for Mars (and to do so with less money than requested).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A costly and complex distraction,'' is how one Republican critic, Representative Steven Palazzo of Mississippi, described the asteroid mission. Other legislators complained that the project seemed far-fetched and poorly articulated, and that it would not advance America's bragging rights in space the way a return to the Moon could. The bill awaits a vote by the full House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA and its rocket scientists are trying to figure out how to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama had asked them to find a way to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s. They presented their plan in April, describing it, perhaps immodestly, as a way to ''protect our planet'' from dangerous asteroids in addition to making strides in human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A non-NASA study had estimated the total cost of capturing and redirecting an asteroid at $2.6 billion. New analysis by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is in charge of the robotic part of the mission, put the cost at perhaps half that -- $1 billion plus the cost of the rocket, said Charles Elachi, the laboratory's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It allows us to get to an asteroid four years ahead of time,'' said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, a former astronaut and a proponent of the asteroid plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nelson, like NASA officials, ticked off other possible benefits: The agency would learn how to push around heavy objects in space, which could help if a large asteroid were on a collision course with Earth; and NASA would develop technologies like thinner, lighter solar panels that would be useful for a human mission to Mars in the 2030s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And the fourth thing it does is, if it ends up an interesting asteroid, then we've got the possibility of the science of mining an asteroid,'' Mr. Nelson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal, unveiled in April as part of Mr. Obama's budget, is far from dead. On Tuesday, a committee in the Democrat-controlled Senate is scheduled to work on its version of the bill, one that makes no mention of capturing asteroids but gives leeway to NASA to do whatever it thinks best for getting to Mars. On the same day, experts will convene at NASA headquarters in Washington to review work on the asteroid mission so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As yet, those experts have not pinpointed an asteroid to kidnap, but the idea is this: First, build a robotic spacecraft with a novel inflatable cone-shaped structure that could envelop the asteroid (which will be tricky to catch, because it will probably be spinning). Next, meet the space rock as it swings by the vicinity of the Earth and the Moon. Then, after essentially wrapping the asteroid in a bag (no lassos are actually involved), the spacecraft would lug it into orbit above the Moon, a slow do-si-do of mechanics that could take a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I think this is a very doable mission,'' said Brian Muirhead, the chief engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, astronauts would travel aboard a giant new rocket that NASA is designing, to meet the asteroid for a closer look. Their trip would give NASA the opportunity to test its deep-space spacecraft, the Orion capsule, as well as its procedures for helping astronauts work with asteroids, which have almost no gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroids have been having their moment in the news, in part because of the terrifying asteroid explosion over Russia in February, which injured about 1,500 people. Last month, NASA announced an Asteroid Grand Challenge, inviting people and organizations to collaborate in finding asteroids that threaten Earth and proposing solutions. On Friday, the agency said it had received more than 400 responses to the challenge and suggestions to help with the asteroid capture mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, at least two private companies have announced intentions to mine asteroids for rare metals, arguing that supplies on Earth are dwindling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is near unanimity in Congress and NASA that the ultimate goal is to send people to Mars, but the logistical challenges and costs are too big to conquer right away. NASA officials depict the asteroid capture plan as an elegant interim step, one that would send humans deeper into space than before and break new ground in rocket technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Republicans on the House science committee complained this month that the proposal came ''out of the blue,'' lacking much explanation from NASA officials, support from scientists or cost analysis. Some Democrats on the committee were also skeptical, but most were willing to hear NASA out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was never very excited about it,'' said Representative Donna F. Edwards of Maryland, a Democrat on the committee. However, she was much more critical of the Republican alternative that passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some Democrats, the Republican objections came across as part of a larger strategy to block Mr. Obama on all fronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really thought that was really a direct insult to the president,'' said Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, NASA's bipartisan support in Congress dates to its founding in 1958 in the aftermath of Russia's launching of Sputnik. And it is far too soon to say whether the House Republicans' objections will ultimately scuttle the asteroid plan. But some longtime NASA observers wonder if the differing views can coalesce to give NASA clear marching orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as the Republicans control the House and Mr. Obama is president, I don't think that agreement will happen, and we'll just muddle through,'' said John M. Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Democrats say that the current House bill, the NASA Authorization Act of 2013, would give the agency an impossible mission, reviving expensive ambitions to send astronauts back to the Moon while proposing to cut NASA's budget to $16.6 billion for the next fiscal year, down from $17.8 billion appropriated this year. Republicans have taken the position that spending plans should take into account the current budget sequester. The Senate authorization bill, being taken up this week, proposes $18.1 billion for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the fiscal climate, the Republicans' Moon ambitions are just not possible, according to Louis D. Friedman, a former executive director of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit group that promotes space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly, it comes down to this or nothing,'' Dr. Friedman said, referring to the asteroid plan. ''This at least does everything we need in the American space program at a price we can afford while we debate when we are going to make those bigger commitments.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phrase ''scientific revolution'' tends to get overused. But there is one happening right now that could arguably alter the entire trajectory of human existence by profoundly realigning what we know of the complex, undulating road that has taken us from atoms adrift in the void to living, thinking beings in merely four billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using techniques of exquisite sensitivity and technological finesse, astronomers have spent the past two decades on an astonishing voyage of cosmic discovery. They have found that the universe is full of planets: Cold, small, and dark next to their large and glaring suns, these worlds have previously been hidden from us.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet they are a critical piece of a great puzzle. In many ways they represent the final order of unfinished business for the Copernican worldview. We've never been able to completely convince ourselves that we're nothing special, not central to the cosmos, because our solar system has been the only planetary collective known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planets are tiny crumbs of matter -- leftovers from epochs where gravity collapses and compresses vast interstellar nebulae into new stars. They're fossil detritus, matter that gathers like droplets on a cooling windowpane, surviving as dust and gas around them evaporates and dissipates. To spot them represents a challenge that has been compared to looking across thousands of miles to see a firefly buzzing around a brilliant searchlight. But they can be spotted, both deliberately and serendipitously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like everything else, they exert a gravitational pull, tugging their parent stars into a gently wobbling motion that we can now detect, even if it's barely more than the pace of a slow walker seen from hundreds of trillions of miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, by sheer random alignment, they appear to flit across the face of their suns. From our perspective the star's light dims minutely, mere fractions of a percent, as the planet gets in the way. And if we patiently monitor millions of stars we will occasionally see one brighten and fade -- a manifestation of Einstein's physics as another star, and its planets, drifts between us and the stellar backdrop, serving as a gravitational lens, an interstellar magnifying glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result of extraordinary efforts to watch for these subtle signatures is that we now have firm evidence for thousands of planets, around thousands of stars. We also know something about these worlds, their sizes, their orbits, often their ages. In a handful of cases, for planets of Jupiter's or Neptune's size, we have even measured the temperature of their upper atmospheres and sniffed at their gaseous chemistry, finding substances like sodium, methane and water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a rich bounty that has taken even scientists by surprise, but it's only the beginning, because the numbers are pointing to something even more remarkable in our future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how conservative or optimistic we are, the statistics tell us that something like an astonishing one out of every seven stars must harbor a planet similar in size to the Earth, and at roughly the right orbital distance to allow for the possibility of a temperate surface environment. In other words, roughly 15 percent of all suns could, in principle, be hosting a place suitable for life as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since our galaxy contains at least 200 billion stars, this implies a vast arena for the universe's ubiquitous carbon chemistry to play in -- a process that, as here on Earth, might lead to the complex machinery of life. Indeed, there is a 95-percent confidence -- give or take a few percent -- that one of these worlds could be within a mere 16 light years of us. That's a stone's throw, practically our galactic backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's really only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Even in our own solar system we have our suspicions that environments inside ice-rich moons around Jupiter or Saturn could also represent life-amenable zones. We know too that the conditions humans find palatable are not the same as those for countless other species. The opportunities for life seem enormous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This incredible abundance of planets in our galaxy is a portent of what's to come; the first shot fired; the first statement of intent in a new revolution. It doesn't yet tell us whether or not we are alone in the universe or, as in the Copernican outlook, merely one among billions. But it is already telling us something shockingly profound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the universe makes so many planets, the chances of our finding others that we can actually study in detail increases enormously. Until now there was nothing we knew about the universe that made this inevitable. Planets could have been few and far between. Even if there were billions in total, they could have been scattered thinly across the cosmos. Thus, it was still a possibility that we'd forever be like the lonely ship's spotter, vainly looking for land from the crow's-nest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the age-old dream of finding other life in the cosmos, whether silent microbes or noisy technological civilizations, has just taken a very sharp turn for the positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It really is true therefore that we stand on the verge of learning more about the nature of life, and of our own significance, than at any other time in human history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was -- and is -- a big deal for us to peer into the microscopic to understand the atomic and subatomic. It has also been momentous to learn that the entirety of existence, our universe, originated some 13.8 billion years ago. And yes, we reached a pinnacle of self-discovery by realizing that we are merely one expression of an awesomely complex and ancient system of molecular machinery, evolving and selecting itself across the ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to discover whether or not we are alone, whether or not something akin to this Earth has happened somewhere else, and perhaps, just perhaps, whether or not there are other minds, on other worlds, thinking these same kinds of thoughts? That's big, perhaps the biggest thing that could ever happen to a species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could have been impossible to ever address the question, but we now know that nature has provided us with a shot at finding out, that there are billions upon billions of places to search. That really is the start of a revolution.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea -- Satellite images show that North Korea has halted work at a complex believed to have been intended to allow it to launch bigger and longer-range rockets, a Washington-based research organization reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization, the U.S.-Korea Institute at <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span>, and others have been using commercial satellite imagery to monitor the complex, the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, in northeastern North Korea. They have previously detected the building of a new launching pad, missile assembly building and launch control center that they believe are designed to launch larger rockets capable of flying longer distances and delivering heavier payloads than the North's Unha-3 rocket, which successfully thrust a satellite into orbit in December.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea says it launches rockets for the peaceful purpose of sending scientific satellites into orbit. But Washington sees them as a cover for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could one day strike targets as far away as North America with nuclear warheads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute first noticed that the work at Tonghae stopped at the end of 2012. In its latest update, posted on its Web site 38 North, it said on Tuesday that the construction had not resumed as of late May, although it was not clear what had caused the seven-month halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if North Korea resumes work, the lull means that the new projects might not be completed until 2017, a year longer than earlier estimates, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Initial speculation at the end of 2012 focused on the need for equipment and troops elsewhere to repair damage done by last summer's typhoons and heavy rains,'' it said. ''That explanation now seems less plausible given the amount of time that has passed since last year's rains.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alternative explanation is that the North has decided that testing conducted at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, in northwestern North Korea, will be sufficient to support its development of larger rockets, the institute said, without citing any evidence to support its theory. North Korea conducted its December rocket launching from the Sohae station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Or the stoppage may reflect a decision either to slow or even halt development of larger rockets,'' it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such an analysis contradicts recent official pronouncements from Pyongyang. Despite international criticism and United Nations sanctions, North Korea has vowed to continue to build and launch more powerful rockets. Again using satellite imagery, 38 North said on July 10 that North Korea might have conducted engine tests for a more powerful rocket at the Sohae facility in late March or early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During military tensions that followed the North's nuclear test in February and ensuing sanctions from the <span class="companylink">United Nations Security Council</span>, North Korea claimed to have the ability to hit the continental United States with nuclear missiles. American intelligence agencies are divided over how close the North has come to attaining such an ability. Still, Washington announced plans to deploy more missile interceptors on the West Coast.</p>

Paleontologists at the Utah Museum of Natural History, writing in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, identified it using fossil records unearthed in the state. The Nasutoceratops had distinctive long, curved horns, a relatively understated neck flourish and pronounced nose, the researchers said.

Comet ISON (for the International Scientific Optical Network telescope used to discover it last year) is on a path to slingshot around the Sun later this year, coming so close (about 40 million miles) to Earth in December that it might be visible during daylight. But before that happens, ISON has to survive a long, treacherous journey, starting with a late-July crossing of the so-called ''frost line,'' the spot about 250 million miles from the Sun where radiation could begin to melt much of the comet's water. If ISON survives, Earth is one step closer to a Christmas spectacular.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Week column on July 23 misstated the timing of events responsible for the origins of gold on Earth. The gold was formed by collisions of ancient stars that occurred well before the Earth formed, which was about 4.5 billion years ago. The stellar events themselves did not occur 4.5 billion years ago. (A reader pointed out the error in an email in December; this correction was further delayed for research.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harold G. White, a physicist and advanced propulsion engineer at NASA, beckoned toward a table full of equipment there on a recent afternoon: a laser, a camera, some small mirrors, a ring made of ceramic capacitors and a few other objects.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other NASA engineers have been designing and redesigning these instruments, with the goal of using them to slightly warp the trajectory of a photon, changing the distance it travels in a certain area, and then observing the change with a device called an interferometer. So sensitive is their measuring equipment that it was picking up myriad earthly vibrations, including people walking nearby. So they recently moved into this lab, which floats atop a system of underground pneumatic piers, freeing it from seismic disturbances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team is trying to determine whether faster-than-light travel -- warp drive -- might someday be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warp drive. Like on ''Star Trek.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Space has been expanding since the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago,'' said Dr. White, 43, who runs the research project. ''And we know that when you look at some of the cosmology models, there were early periods of the universe where there was explosive inflation, where two points would've went receding away from each other at very rapid speeds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nature can do it,'' he said. ''So the question is, can we do it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein famously postulated that, as Dr. White put it, ''thou shalt not exceed the speed of light,'' essentially setting a galactic speed limit. But in 1994, a Mexican physicist, Miguel Alcubierre, theorized that faster-than-light speeds were possible in a way that did not contradict Einstein, though Dr. Alcubierre did not suggest anyone could actually construct the engine that could accomplish that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His theory involved harnessing the expansion and contraction of space itself. Under Dr. Alcubierre's hypothesis, a ship still couldn't exceed light speed in a local region of space. But a theoretical propulsion system he sketched out manipulated space-time by generating a so-called ''warp bubble'' that would expand space on one side of a spacecraft and contract it on another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this way, the spaceship will be pushed away from the Earth and pulled towards a distant star by space-time itself,'' Dr. Alcubierre wrote. Dr. White has likened it to stepping onto a moving walkway at an airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Alcubierre's paper was purely theoretical, and suggested insurmountable hurdles. Among other things, it depended on large amounts of a little understood or observed type of ''exotic matter'' that violates typical physical laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White believes that advances he and others have made render warp speed less implausible. Among other things, he has redesigned the theoretical warp-traveling spacecraft -- and in particular a ring around it that is key to its propulsion system -- in a way that he believes will greatly reduce the energy requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is quick to offer up his own caveats, however, saying his warp research is akin to a university science project that is just trying to prove that a microscopic warp bubble can be detected in a lab. ''We're not bolting this to a spacecraft,'' he said of the warp technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White was an engineer with a background in the aerospace industry when he came to NASA in 2000, starting his career at the agency by operating the arms of space shuttles. He got his doctorate in physics from <span class="companylink">Rice University</span> in 2008, and now works on a range of projects aimed at taking NASA beyond the fiery rockets that have long characterized space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA, Dr. White's warp speed experiments represent a rounding error in its budget, with about $50,000 spent on equipment in an agency that spends nearly $18 billion annually. The agency is far more focused on more achievable projects -- building the next generation Orion series spacecraft, working on the International Space Station and preparing for a planned future mission to capture an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has made internal resources available for the project and freed up other engineers to assist Dr. White. It has also restored the pneumatic system in the laboratory Dr. White is using, to allow it to float. The lab was once used to test equipment for Apollo missions and has control panels underneath it that look like they belong in a fallout shelter that time forgot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Stich, the deputy director of engineering at the Johnson Space Center, said, ''You always have to be looking towards the future.'' He held up his iPhone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Forty years ago, this was 'Star Trek,' Captain Kirk talking on a communicator whenever he wanted to,'' he said. ''But today it exists because people made the battery technology that allows this device to exist, worked on the software technology, worked on the computational technology, the touch screen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theoretically, a warp drive could cut the travel time between stars from tens of thousands of years to weeks or months. But we should probably not book reservations anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My personal opinion is that the idea is crazy for now,'' said Edwin F. Taylor, a former editor of The American Journal of Physics and senior research scientist at M.I.T. ''Check with me in a hundred years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Richard Obousy, a physicist who is president of Icarus Interstellar, a nonprofit group composed of volunteers collaborating on starship design, said ''it is not airy-fairy, pie in the sky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We tend to overestimate what we can do on short time scales, but I think we massively underestimate what we can do on longer time scales,'' he said of the work of Dr. White, who is a friend and Icarus collaborator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White likened his experiments to the early stages of the Manhattan Project, which were aimed at creating a very small nuclear reaction merely as proof that it could be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They tried to go through and demonstrate a nuclear reactor and generate half a watt,'' he said. ''That's not something you're going to market. Nobody's going to buy that. It's just making sure they understood the physics and science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil deGrasse Tyson, the well-known astrophysicist at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, said some leap beyond our current technology would be needed to make interstellar travel feasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Routine travel among the stars is impossible without new discoveries regarding the fabric of space and time, or capability to manipulate it for our needs,'' he said, adding, ''By my read, the idea of a functioning warp drive remains far-fetched, but the real take-away is that people are thinking about it -- reminding us all that the urge to explore continues to run deep in our species.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, one of the most dubious is Dr. Alcubierre himself. He listed a number of concerns, starting with the vast amounts of exotic matter that would be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The warp drive on this ground alone is impossible,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he posed a more fundamental question: How would you turn it on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At speeds larger than the speed of light, the front of the warp bubble cannot be reached by any signal from within the ship,'' he said. ''This does not just mean we can't turn it off; it is much worse. It means we can't even turn it on in the first place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White, who has never spoken to Dr. Alcubierre, said ''I appreciate his thoughts. I don't know whether I agree with all of his observations, based on some work I've done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He and I could certainly debate for a very long time,'' he added.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, six people are living in a nearly windowless, white geodesic dome on the slopes of Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano. They sleep in tiny rooms, use no more than eight minutes of shower time a week and subsist on a diet of freeze-dried, canned or preserved food. When they go outside, they exit through a mock air lock, clad head to toe in simulated spacesuits. The dome's occupants are playing a serious version of the game of pretend -- what if we lived on Mars?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) project, funded in part by NASA, is a continuation of a long history of attempts to understand what will happen to people who travel through outer space for long periods of time. It's more than a technical problem. Besides multistage rockets to propel a spacecraft out of Earth's atmosphere, years of planning and precise calculations and massive amounts of fuel, traveling the tens of millions of miles to Mars will take a tremendous amount of time. With current technology, the journey takes more than eight months each way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which means that astronauts will get bored. In fact, a number of scientists say that -- of all things -- boredom is one of the biggest threats to a manned Mars mission, despite the thrill inherent in visiting another planet. And so, attention is being paid to the effects of boredom at HI-SEAS, and on the International Space Station. But because of the causes of chronic boredom, scientists say, research facilities in Antarctica might actually provide a better simulation of the stress of a journey to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most living things constantly seek out sensory stimulation -- new smells, tastes, sights, sounds or experiences. Even single-celled amoebas will move to investigate new sources of light or heat, says Sheryl Bishop, who studies human performance in extreme environments at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Animals deprived of naturalistic environments and the mental stimulation that come with them can fall into repetitive, harmful patterns of behavior. Anybody of a certain age will remember zoos full of manically pacing tigers, bears gnawing on their metal cages and birds that groomed themselves bald -- all a result, we now know, of their rather unstimulating lifestyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Human boredom isn't quite as well understood, says James Danckert, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo. He's currently working on what he says may be the first study of how our brain activity changes when we're bored. Danckert is hoping to find out whether boredom is connected to a phenomenon called the ''default network'' -- a background hum of brain activity that seems to remain on even when you aren't directly focused on something. There's a lot of observable activity in the brains of people who are staring at a blank screen -- way more than anybody expected, Danckert says. The default network maps closely to the brain-activity patterns scientists see when someone's mind is wandering. It suggests that what we call a restless mind is just that -- a mind desperate for something to amuse it, searching frantically for stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boredom, it turns out, is a form of stress. Psychologically, it's the mirror image of having too much work to do, says Jason Kring, president of the Society of Human Performance in Extreme Environments, an organization that studies how people live and work in space, underwater, on mountaintops and other high-risk places. If your brain does not receive sufficient stimulus, it might find something else to do -- it daydreams, it wanders, it thinks about itself. If this goes on too long, it can affect your mind's normal functioning. Chronic boredom correlates with depression and attention deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronaut candidates go through two years of training before they're even approved to fly. And before they are chosen to be candidates, they have to compete against thousands of other applicants. The 2013 class, for instance, had more than 6,000 applicants and only 8 were chosen. Astronauts are rigorously tested for psychological as well as physical fitness. But no mission in NASA's history has raised the specter of chronic boredom to the degree that a Mars mission does, because none have involved such a long journey through nothingness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if, millions of miles from home, a chronically bored astronaut forgets a certain safety procedure? What if he gets befuddled while reading an oxygen gauge? More important, Danckert and Kring say, bored people are also prone to taking risks, subconsciously seeking out stimulation when their environment bores them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cognitive and social psychologist Peter Suedfeld says that people will sometimes do reckless, stupid things when they suffer from chronic boredom. In Antarctica, where winter can cut scientists and crew off from the rest of the world for as long as nine months, the isolation can lead to strange behavior. Suedfeld told me he has heard about Antarctic researchers venturing outside in 40-below weather without proper clothing and without telling anyone else they were going out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diaries of early polar explorers are full of tales of extreme boredom, depression and desperate attempts at entertainment reminiscent of prisoners' stories from solitary confinement. An important lesson that Antarctica can impart on a Mars expedition is this: even scientists on important missions can get excruciatingly bored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One effective way astronauts combat boredom is by staying busy with work. That's a strategy at HI-SEAS, where the crew member Kate Greene told me that her schedule is packed -- every hour planned and accounted for, from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed at night. Life on the International Space Station is similar. (In fact, historically, NASA's problem has been overworking people: in 1973, the exhausted crew of Skylab 4 actually staged a relaxation rebellion and took an unscheduled day off.) But Antarctica is different from HI-SEAS or the International Space Station. Communications are limited. There's nobody outside the base directing your day. Spectacular views vanish in a haze of white. It's just you, the people you came in with, no way out and little to break up the monotony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so some researchers there have learned to actively fend off boredom by creating what you might call a unique office culture. They celebrate a ridiculous number of holidays, both traditional and invented. You need something to look forward to, Suedfeld says, and planning the events helps change the routine. Even Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic crew found ways to put on skits and concerts. On one expedition, Shackleton brought a small printing press. At McMurdo Station, the 1983 winter crew created costumes, learned lines and acted out scenes from the movie ''Escape From New York.'' It's possible that we may, someday, watch recordings of Mars-bound astronauts acting out other John Carpenter films. (It's not so far-fetched. Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut, made a tribute to David Bowie's ''Space Oddity'' that racked up more than 16 million views on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might sound absurd, but many scientists say strategies like this are necessary because, without proper mental stimulus, we risk making a physically and technologically challenging endeavor into a psychologically grueling one. It would be catastrophic if humanity's greatest voyage were brought low by the mind's tendency to wander when left to its own devices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears that the toxic cloud would waft into Baikonur were eased later in the day, however, after heavy rains dispersed the fumes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photographs posted online had shown the ominous cloud stretching over buildings near the launching pad, and residents of Baikonur, population 70,000, had been instructed to stay indoors and refrain from using air conditioners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proton-M rocket rose just above its launching tower at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, wobbled and then tipped over into the desert in a ball of fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short flight on Tuesday was the fourth Proton failure in three years, and it was sure to raise safety questions among NASA officials and Western commercial clients of Russia's space services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> has relied on Russia to provide transportation for American astronauts headed to the International Space Station. But those spaceflights have been powered by a Soyuz rocket that has a far stronger safety record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span> did not immediately offer an explanation for the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no reported injuries at the site of the accident, an area that Russia rents for rocket launchings. But the short flight, instead of a journey to space, made for one of the most prominent rocket disasters in Russia's space program in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''According to the preliminary estimates from the Russian side, there is no destruction and there are no casualties,'' the Kazakh space agency, KazCosmos, said in a statement, according to Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In video of the crash broadcast by Rossiya 24, a Russian state television channel, the satellites appeared to break apart from the nose cone as the rocket tumbled to earth. The station estimated their value at $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the live broadcast, the announcer noted as the rocket leaned over and flew horizontally, ''It seems something is not right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcer goes on to repeat that ''something is not right,'' and added that ''the rocket is now heading toward the ground and breaking apart in the air -- and an explosion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash was another setback for the Proton rocket, a workaday booster for the Russian space program that is used for commercial and military payloads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most pressing concern was the orange cloud, which owed its color to heptyl, a highly toxic type of fuel known as UDMH outside of Russia, that is used on the larger stages of the rocket. Kazakh authorities were cited by the Interfax news agency as saying they might evacuate towns, though the region is sparsely populated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proton is one of the largest rockets used today, weighing 700 tons on the launching pad, according to a reference book published by the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span>. A fully loaded <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 747, by comparison, weighs about 400 tons. Most of the rocket's weight is fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after successful launchings, herders have found dead cows underneath flight paths, killed by eating grass that came into contact with jettisoned rocket stages contaminated with unburned heptyl.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen L. Nyberg, an American astronaut whose son, Jack, is 3 years old, is taking the next six months to find out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with docking space ships and conducting science experiments, Ms. Nyberg, 43, who blasted off in late May, is using her tour at the International Space Station to grapple publicly with the difficulty of separating from a child because of work. She is cooperating with a Scandinavian television documentary on motherhood, has spoken to magazines on parenting and embraced the question her long business trip inevitably poses: how to choose between a dream job that requires long travel and the pull of children at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a challenge because my son is 3. He will do a lot of growing in six months,'' Ms. Nyberg told journalists before the launching, speaking from behind a glass wall to prevent last-minute infections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I will see a lot of video of him,'' she said. ''We will be very well connected. And he will be home with Daddy'' -- Doug Hurley, who is also an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it will be fun for him to see me there,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mother in space is not a new phenomenon: The first, Anna Fisher, an American, blasted off in 1984 aboard the space shuttle Discovery, leaving behind a 1-year-old daughter, Kristin. (Space authorities do not keep records on how many astronauts, the vast majority of whom are male, are also parents.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the International Space Station occupied by six people nearly permanently, and no fewer than three at any time, many more mothers and fathers are spending long spells away in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither NASA nor the <span class="companylink">Russian Federal Space Agency</span>, the lead partners in the International Space Station, has a policy on parenting and work at the station, where astronauts and cosmonauts typically spend six months on rotations. The choice to go, or not, is individual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, turning down too many trips can eventually harm a career -- a point taken in Russia's labor law, which allows mothers of children age 3 or younger and single fathers to opt out of work travel without repercussions. If they do choose to travel, the law specifies that they must provide their employer with a letter waiving their right to stay at home. U.S. labor law has no similar provision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Russia, normally, bringing up a child is more a woman's obligation,'' Nadezhda Ilyushina, a labor lawyer with the Goltsblat law firm in Moscow, explained. ''A child needs female attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast of today's space moms -- gregarious public figures, open to media attention -- with the experience of the first woman in space is striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Valentina Tereshkova, Russia's first female cosmonaut and the first woman to fly in space, took off 50 years ago from this same site, she did not tell her family where she was going. She said she was headed to a competition of parachutists, as preparation for the flight was secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two Russian women have followed since -- Svetlana Y. Savitskaya in the 1980s, and Elena V. Kondakova in the 1990s, who spent more than five months away from her daughter for her first spaceflight. Of the remaining 54 women who have been in space, 45 are American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For today's working mothers in space, as for earthbound peers, the key to managing the conflict between work and home sometimes lies in blurring the distinction between the two realms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Stott, an American who flew to the International Space Station in 2009 when her son, Roman, was 7, said it helped to show him her training and to introduce him to her crewmates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a kid getting to see the toys their parents get to spend time with,'' she said. ''You want to make sure your family is involved with that adventure you are about to have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cady Coleman, an American astronaut who spent Mother's Day in space in 2011, took a stuffed tiger with her to photograph beside her experiments to amuse her 10-year-old son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nyberg, too, has taken some of her son's toys so that he can see them float in zero gravity during video calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As female astronauts look for ways to cope with long separations from their families, they say they can count on the experience, and the example, of their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because liftoffs are emotional, and the fear lurks that Mom or Dad will not return, NASA prefers to keep families cloistered from public view as a launching approaches, a spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Russian Space Agency</span> takes a different approach. Families are very much welcome at the spartan launch site in Kazakhstan, although there is little room to allow even a few moments of privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Nyberg blasted off last month aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket, her crewmates included two other parents: Luca Parmitano, an Italian fighter pilot and flight engineer, and Fyodor N. Yurchikhin, a Russian space veteran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yurchikhin parted with his wife, Larisa, and daughters, Lena, 11, and Dania, 19, before a crowd of officials, pressing his gloved hand against the glass, winking and saying, ''Don't worry, my girls, everything will be all right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he first flew, he said, Lena was 1 year old. ''When I got back I asked, 'Where was Daddy?' and she pointed to the television set,'' he said. Lena squirmed now at the recollection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nyberg, who had trained with the two men for years, said the three would ''support each other knowing we have families at home whom we miss.''</p>
