<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this launch, only cargo is going; private transportation for astronauts is still several years away. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span> of Hawthorne, Calif. -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short -- launched its Falcon 9 rocket on schedule at 8:35 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral, Fla.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket is carrying a capsule called Dragon that contains about 1,000 pounds of food, clothing, equipment and science experiments, including 23 designed and built by students. The cargo also includes a freezer that can store laboratory samples at temperatures as low as 300 degrees below zero. The goods are scheduled to reach the space station on Wednesday, and the capsule will stay docked for a few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It actually marks the beginning of true commercial spaceflight to take cargo to the International Space Station for us,'' Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, said during a video chat on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Plus on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> successfully launched a capsule to the space station in a test flight in May, but Sunday's launching is the first of a dozen flights under a $1.6 billion contract with <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The student projects come through a program run by NanoRacks, a company that arranges for experiments to fly to the space station, and the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education. They include one from middle school students in Santa Monica, Calif., who want to know whether Silly Putty -- a non-Newtonian dilatant fluid, in scientific terms -- has different properties in the weightlessness of space than it does on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plans, the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> spacecraft will return to Earth near the end of October and splash down about 250 miles off the coast of Southern California. A successful mission would restore some of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s ability to bring back items from the space station, which it lost with the termination of the space shuttle program last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second company, the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., is preparing its rocket for a test flight this year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the first presidential debate coming up on Wednesday, it is striking -- if not surprising -- how bland and predictable the candidates have been in discussing America's role in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, President Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney, each responded at length to a question posed by ScienceDebate 2012 about the nation's goals in space. But while both emphasized the importance of space exploration, with Mr. Obama briefly mentioning the need for monitoring the Earth, neither candidate, and neither party, has addressed the scientific question of why we want to bother with exploring space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issues that were addressed explicitly -- national pride, technological innovation, national security -- may be interesting and relevant, but they are largely spinoffs of what is usually claimed to be a grand scientific adventure. This is not a new phenomenon. Tapes of John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office released last month made it clear that from his perspective, science was irrelevant to the space race he proclaimed back in 1962. What counted was beating the Russians to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe scientists should simply face reality and accept that science doesn't play a central role in the government's equation. Yet as much as GPS navigation is of great help to me, and as fun as it looks to be an astronaut floating around the International Space Station, I suspect I am not alone in being far more excited by the images produced by NASA's unmanned space probes -- which do the science, after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, every time I see a Hubble Space Telescope photograph showing hundreds of galaxies, each containing billions of stars whose light has taken billions of years to travel to the Hubble cameras, it inspires me to ponder whether they may have been surrounded by now-frozen planets harboring long-dead civilizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And closer to home, I have to admit that I am in love with Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that NASA rover landed on Mars this summer, I was privileged to be near the deep-space antenna in Tidbinbilla, Australia, where the signals from Curiosity were beamed before they were forwarded to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. I haven't been as excited to watch a spacecraft land on another body since I was a kid and stayed home to watch Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin land on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe I was more excited about Curiosity, not just because I was closer to the action but because the astounding complexity of the landing was achieved without any direct human intervention, in just nine minutes -- considerably shorter than the time light takes to travel from Mars to Earth. Knowing that the spacecraft had either landed or crashed 15 minutes earlier made the anticipation seem even more pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is why unmanned space exploration seems to me much more exciting and scientifically worthwhile than human spaceflight, especially at a time of restricted budgets and nascent technology. Sending Curiosity to Mars cost only about 10 times what it would cost to make a movie about sending Bruce Willis to Mars -- and perhaps a hundredth of the cost of actually sending humans there and back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of my colleagues are geologists who are not shy about pointing out that a human geologist could do in a few days what Curiosity may do in a year or two. But we aren't likely to send geologists there anytime soon -- and if we did, they wouldn't be able to stay much longer than a few days, while Curiosity can silently and gently move about the planet for a decade or more, powered by its plutonium generator. Moreover, by the time we might get around to sending humans, in two to three decades at best, robots will have advanced to the point where they might easily compete in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of scientific payoff, it makes far more sense to spend money on Mars rovers, since 99 percent of the cost of sending humans into space involves keeping them alive and getting them back, leaving precious little for science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But cost aside, I find the adventure more exciting. The thought of Curiosity braving the Martian days and nights alone -- rolling slowly along, zapping rocks and occasionally picking them up, sending stunning, detailed photos of an alien terrain like a tourist using a cellphone to communicate with loved ones back home -- is both heartwarming and bittersweet. Every time I go to the NASA Web site and open up a new photo of the day's tour, I feel as if I am there. If it takes a year to get to the base of a nearby mountain, who cares? I will enjoy every step of the journey even more because it is a gentle one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the coming decades we may send more robotic explorers to even harsher climes, maybe to explore deep oceans on Jupiter's moon Europa, or to search on comets for telltale signs of life's origins. We may send powerful telescopes into space that may one day photograph distant worlds that may harbor life. For me, sending these probes where no man or woman has gone before is every bit as thrilling as imagining Captain Kirk being teleported down to an alien surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while such probes may do less for national security than sending satellites to orbit the Earth to spy on our friends and enemies, I am reminded of a statement by Robert R. Wilson, the first director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. When asked during a Congressional hearing whether the particle accelerator would aid in the defense of the nation, he said it would not -- but it would help keep the nation worth defending.</p>

''It just seemed like someone came along the surface of Mars with a jackhammer and lifted up a sidewalk that you might see in downtown L.A.,'' said John Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist. From the size of the rounded pebbles embedded in the slab, the scientists estimated that water was flowing about a yard a second and was between ankle and hip deep. NASA has found bountiful evidence of liquid water on early Mars when it might have been warmer, but this was the first observation of an ancient streambed. Curiosity is looking for carbon-based molecules which, together with liquid water, could have provided all of the necessary building blocks for life.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, Calif. -- Matt Heverly, 36, started a recent workday as any young father might: up at 5:30, gulping coffee, fixing a bottle for the baby. He threw on jeans and a T-shirt and drove his two sons to day care. He stopped to get the brakes on his Toyota checked and swung by the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he went to the office ... to drive a $2.5 billion robot on Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heverly leads a team of 16 drivers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here. Together, they are responsible for steering a six-wheeled, plutonium-powered rover called Curiosity across the Red Planet's Gale Crater. Equipped with futuristic tools like a laser that can vaporize rock, the 2,000-pound robot arrived on Mars on Aug. 6, and Mr. Heverly took the wheel -- or computer keyboard, actually -- on Aug. 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Driving'' a rover might be a misleading term. There is no joystick or accelerator, for a start. Mr. Heverly and his teammates tell the vehicle where to go next by entering hundreds of computer commands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the driving is not done in real time: during the Martian night, the team plans where to send Curiosity next and sends instructions via radio transmission as the Mars day begins. Then the drivers go home, back to life on Earth, with all of its ''don't forget to take out the garbage'' mundanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to try not to think about what's happening out there, which is, of course, completely impossible,'' Vandi Tompkins, 39, one of the drivers, said with caffeinated exuberance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rover may be executing a successful drive based on your instructions,'' she said, ''or you may have just sent a national asset over a cliff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, as Mr. Heverly put it, ''Last night I drove on Mars, today I mowed the lawn -- it's completely surreal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity's drivers are only a small group within NASA's Mars exploration program, which investigates the Martian climate and geology and oversees an older, more rudimentary rover, Opportunity. Several thousand people work on the Mars program, but it was 30 or so Curiosity team members who struck a worldwide chord last month when NASA shared video of their reaction to the rover's landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wearing matching blue polo shirts for the occasion, the team members were seen listening for a mission controller's confirmation of success -- ''We are wheels down on Mars. Oh, my God!'' -- and breaking out in raucous cheers and high-fives. Bobak Ferdowsi, a flight director who sports a mohawk with red, white and blue streaks, now says, wincing, ''We all looked like Smurfs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe a little. But it was the group's esprit de corps that left the lasting impression. A spoof video, ''We're NASA and We Know It,'' recorded to the beat of the song ''Sexy and I Know It,'' now has 2.4 million views on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. Mr. Ferdowsi, now known online as Mohawk Guy, has 53,000 Twitter followers, up from a couple of hundred before the mission. (The Martian landscape is ''pretty amazeballs,'' he wrote in a post on Aug. 23.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People inside Building 264 here, part of the Space Flight Operations Facility, have long had a sense of humor about themselves -- at one rocket launching, a group of scientists wore Spock ears. ''It's just that before social media, nobody was really watching,'' Mr. Ferdowsi said. ''I'm still kind of amazed at the attention. I don't think there's anything all that interesting about me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, this is like any other office: gray industrial carpeting, fluorescent lighting, cramped cubicles that are mostly undecorated, unless you count empty cans of Red Bull. A small pantry has packages of dried fruit snacks. There is the occasional potluck dinner and an office softball team; at a recent game, everyone wore fake mohawks to tease Mr. Ferdowsi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the elevator, people say things like ''Can you press seven? I'm going to Jupiter.'' They are not kidding. The seventh floor is home to Juno, a mission to the solar system's largest planet. (Mars is on six and four.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a quiet cockiness. ''We definitely win the coolest job contest at cocktail parties,'' said John Wright, 56, a Curiosity driver who had reported to work in a baseball cap, a T-shirt and shorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What do you do? Oh, you're an investment banker? Isn't that special,'' Mr. Wright continued. ''I drive on Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job can be grueling. For at least the first three months of Curiosity's multiyear exploration, the drivers will be living and working on Mars time. The Martian day, called a Sol, is longer than a day on Earth by 39 minutes and 35 seconds, which adds up quickly; morning on Earth becomes night on Mars within a couple of weeks. For the drivers, keeping this schedule is like moving two time zones to the west every three days, tossing them into a perpetual state of jet lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm kind of so sleep-deprived at this point that I'm beyond the point where caffeine helps,'' Mr. Heverly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heverly became a driver in an amusingly simple way. He started working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory seven years ago after obtaining a master's degree in robotics from <span class="companylink">Boston University</span>. ''And one day they literally sent out an e-mail that said, 'Does anybody want to drive a rover?' '' he said. He raised his hand (''Like, duh'') and, after a year of training, began commanding Opportunity. He worked with that rover for four years before switching to Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who decides who gets to drive and when? Drivers are scheduled by supervisors several weeks in advance, with attention paid to having some of each of people who specialize in certain rover functions: mobility, arm, turret. Up to half a dozen drivers work any one shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workdays have a rigorous time structure. Curiosity beams down a report at 4 p.m. Mars time (one recent Thursday, that meant 1:44 p.m. Pacific time) of how its drive went. A group of analysts has 15 minutes to figure out if everything succeeded, a self-imposed deadline to get the planning for the next day's drive moving quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists -- there are about 400 working on the Mars mission -- evaluate the data, which usually includes pictures from onboard cameras. Drivers arrive and meet with scientists to discuss where the rover should head next, perhaps 15 feet toward an indentation in the soil that looks interesting. Because they are essentially driving Curiosity blind, they initially have to move slowly, a maximum of 30 feet a day; eventually they will be able to cover about 300 feet a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a plan has been formulated, drivers stare at the images they have of the Martian terrain with 3-D glasses to scout for potential pitfalls (''How afraid are we of that rock?'') and use computer animation to simulate a route. Then they enter hundreds of commands to execute the next day's drive, which can require calibration of movement in gradations of centimeters. They message the rover, hoping that it understands and that no one entered an incorrect code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heverly, turning white, recalled ''a nightmare scenario'' with Opportunity. One day, scientists decided that they wanted the rover to back up. Based on the commands Mr. Heverly entered, Opportunity understood that it needed to return to a spot a few feet back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But instead of simply backing up, it decided to drive around the entire planet to get there,'' Mr. Heverly said. Luckily, an automated safety function kicked in and stopped the rover before it could go very far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a really scary and really humbling day,'' Mr. Heverly said. ''It gives a whole new meaning to 'What did you do at the office today, honey?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no question, in the next couple of years there's going to be commercial space tourism,'' said Roger D. Launius, senior curator of space history at the National Air and Space Museum at the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian Institution</span>. ''That's clearly going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LAUNIUS and other experts say suborbital flights in reusable vehicles are more feasible than, for example, retracing the steps of the Apollo mission. And confidence is high that there is an appetite for even brief tastes of space: last month, the Tauri Group, a Washington-area consulting firm with a specialty in space issues, found a potential market of up to $1.6 billion over the next decade for suborbital flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In terms of an industry moving toward fruition, versus an industry that has a plan,'' said Carissa Christensen, managing partner of the Tauri Group, ''I think it has absolutely made that shift.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a variety of practical reasons for the sudden surge in activity. They include cheaper, better technology and composite materials, along with a burst of previously pent-up entrepreneurship let loose by NASA's new need for private companies to replace shuttle flights. For its part, NASA says it is ''counting on the innovative commercial space industry'' for rides to the space station and other low-orbit destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the desire for such trips may also lie in the fact that people are simply running out of places to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every square inch of Earth, pretty much, has been explored at this point by somebody,'' said Eugene Linden, a science and environmental writer and the author of ''The Ragged Edge of the World,'' about the planet's endangered wild lands. ''Next, we'll be hearing about roller-skating across the East Antarctic ice sheet or something like that in order to have some sense of accomplishment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linden also suggested that some of the lust for going to space may come from a primal animal drive to do something no one else can imitate -- something, he says, that is ''meant to show reproductive robustness on the part of the male.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linden added that while males ''can fake a lot of things -- you can rent a Ferrari for the weekend -- it's hard to fake going to outer space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, Virgin Galactic says 77 percent of its customers are male. And many of those leading the charge to the cosmos are deep-pocketed, ample-ego men like Mr. Branson, 62, who in addition to running the billion-dollar <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span> also recently became the oldest man to kite surf across the English Channel (really). And Virgin Galactic's own SpaceShipTwo happens to be based on a craft -- SpaceShipOne -- that was backed by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. (In 2004 SpaceShipOne became the first privately developed manned vehicle to reach space. It carried a single pilot; no tourists were allowed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's Elon Musk, the dashing chairman of Tesla Motors who founded the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> company, which develops rockets, who hopes to cart astronauts and cargo aloft. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also promises, according to a spokeswoman, to ultimately ''make life interplanetary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, meanwhile, has Blue Origin, a media-shy operation promising ''human access to space at dramatically lower cost and increased reliability'' with suborbital flights and other orbital services, according to the Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, companies planning to offer suborbital trips are already involved in the type of service boasts and fare battles common among airlines, whose early days are often likened to the current state of space companies. While Virgin Galactic, for example, is charging $200,000, Space Adventures, working with Texas-based Armadillo Aerospace, says it can get you there for about half that. And that's not even the cheapest: a company called <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> is working on a nifty little space coupe called the Lynx, which would offer a two-person flight -- just you and the pilot -- for $95,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is more like the 'Right Stuff'-kind of experience,'' said Col. Richard Searfoss, a company test pilot, in a promotional video on the Web site. Missions are expected to start by 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the flights are operational, they will be brief and action-packed. SpaceShipTwo, for instance, will carry six passengers and two pilots. Attached to a twin-fuselage jet, it will take off from Spaceport America, a sleek, futuristic complex on a desolate patch of ranchland in southern New Mexico. It will then cruise to about 50,000 feet, where it will detach and tip skyward, blasting off toward higher orbit. Noise and some serious G-forces will ensue, but once customers reach 60 miles or so, they will coast along in almost complete silence. (Except for your gabby co-astronauts, no doubt.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASSENGERS will then be able to unbuckle from their seats, float in weightlessness and take some killer vacation photos. And oh, what a view: hundreds of miles in every direction, with a glimpse of the Earth's curve and the luminous arc of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re-entry will be a little more intense, with the ship's wings folding and body-depressing G-forces, until it arrives at about 70,000 feet, at which point the wings will open again and the plane will glide back to the Spaceport and the astronaut's giddy family members (and, one hopes, a fully-stocked bar).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the price is steep, the physical requirements are expected to be simple: basic health. And bravery, of course. Paul Barbara, 54, a marina and boat salesman from Babylon, N.Y., said he put down his $200,000 after a lifelong obsession with space. He said he planned to lose some weight before his flight but had no trepidation about being so high above the planet. ''I wouldn't bungee jump,'' he said, ''but I'll go to outer space.'' According to Virgin Galactic, the passenger list already includes a teenager and a 90-year-old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In promotional materials for Virgin Galactic, Glenys Ambe, an Australian fashion retailer, says she bought a ticket as an early 60th-birthday present to herself. ''How cool,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such awe-struck idealism is echoed by many of the corporate backers of the suborbital business, who dislike the term ''space tourism,'' saying it demeans the true beauty of slipping the bonds of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think in terms of explorers and expeditions,'' said J. Buckner Hightower, the executive vice president of Excalibur Almaz, who said that human space exploration -- versus robotic -- is a guiding principle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manned space has always been my thing,'' he said. ''I grew up reading fiction about humans exploring the cosmos. And I just think that it's a two-legged proposition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When exactly that proposition becomes a statement of fact, mind you, is an open question. Companies still have to clear all sorts of regulatory, legal and logistical hurdles. Certain details -- departure dates, for example -- can be hard to come by. Still, Virgin Galactic says that it has more than 500 confirmed customers, many of whom have paid the entire $200,000 to guarantee a seat. (More recent customers have been asked to put down just 10 percent, which is fully refundable.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Bigelow's company -- whose so-called ''habitats'' are launched in a rocket and then expand like space accordions into rudimentary dwellings -- is in a holding pattern until the company can find carriers capable and ready to transport guests. (But don't chuckle at the concept: two of Mr. Bigelow's futuristic bouncy castles have already been shot into orbit.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the private companies, Space Adventures has perhaps the most established track record, having sent a series of paying customers to the space station over the last decade. Like some of its competitors, Space Adventures sometimes uses technology and facilities from the former Soviet Union, including a launch facility in Kazakhstan (If you're interested, though, you'll have to wait: the next flight isn't scheduled until 2014 or so.) Those trips -- to an orbit of more than 200 miles -- are just one of several spacey options offered by the company. Others include zero-gravity flights on a modified 727, starting at $4,950, and flight training in a centrifuge machine starting at $9,750 (airsickness bag not included).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers of Space Adventures say the cost is worth it. Richard Garriott, a video game designer who grew up in Houston (his father, Owen, was an astronaut), traveled to the space station in 2008 and said that the vistas from on high could be life-changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest single moment was when I could look down and see an area I knew intimately -- Texas -- and then see the rest of the Earth,'' Mr. Garriott recalled. ''I thought, 'I now know the true scale of the Earth by direct observation.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest ticket item is the company's never-before-tried trip to the far side of the moon (similar in destination and price to the Excalibur Almaz trip), which would cost some $150 million, but would allow the buyer to ''become a catalyst for humankind's expansion into space,'' according to the company's Web site. Tom Shelley, the company's president, said he'd already sold one seat (launch is scheduled for 2016 ... or 2017).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moon,'' he said, ''is within our reach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe. Skeptics still have their doubts. Paul Milo, author of ''Your Flying Car Awaits,'' which chronicles various failed predictions about space tourism, among other things, said the idea of an average person going to the moon is still far-fetched. ''To be optimistic, maybe by 2030 that could happen,'' Mr. Milo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Milo was more bullish on suborbital flight, in large part because master marketers like Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos are involved. ''The folks at NASA thought about solving a problem,'' Mr. Milo said of early spaceflights. ''Private companies think about market appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Whitesides, the chief executive and president of Virgin Galactic, agrees that the company's goal is not only to fly people to suborbital space for five minutes, but also to ''establish the first commercial space line,'' with an emphasis on customer service, something that Virgin has road-tested with its cooler-than-thou airline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't just mean that you have a vehicle that works,'' he said. ''You have to have a whole customer experience that works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, customers will have a three-day training course at the Spaceport before launch day. And there is talk of building a hotel nearby for families and other well-wishers. (Mr. Whitesides said he can see the company eventually establishing a hotel in space, too, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THAT said, Mr. Whitesides underscored that the company's bigger mission is to ''keep on opening up space to humanity,'' something that will, he hopes, involve lowering that $200,000 price tag. ''We want it so that it's no longer restricted to the elite-elite,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's just such democratization that Mr. Curran seems to be trying to spread. And while Rochester -- home of the bankrupt <span class="companylink">Eastman Kodak</span> company -- might not seem like a fertile market, Mr. Curran said he'd already sold one Virgin ticket since becoming an accredited space agent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Curran, 55, says space never held a particularly strong lure for him. But this has not stopped him from putting down his own $20,000 deposit -- for a space trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why, he sounds Kennedy-esque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know where it's going to take me, and I don't think it would be fair to get involved with it if I only had some sort of guarantee about what I was going to get out of it,'' he said. ''The question might better be asked: What am I going to contribute to it?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first-ever planet-to-planet music broadcast, NASA's Mars rover, Curiosity, beamed a new song by Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas to Earth on Tuesday, playing an mp3 file to an audience of engineers and students at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why do they say the sky is the limit when I've seen the footprints on the moon?" Will.i.am sings in the song, "Reach for the Stars," which made its solar system premiere after a 330-million-mile trip, from Earth to Mars and back again. (Alas, any nearby Martians were out of luck: the rover does not have speakers to broadcast music to its surrounding landscape, and the thin Martian air would have distorted the sound.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The song debut, part of Will.i.am's efforts to cheerlead for science and mathematics education, did not require any advances in space technology, but perhaps reflected a more media-savvy approach by the space agency in making its work seem glamorous. The singer was among a parade of celebrities who descended on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Aug. 5 to watch Curiosity, an automobile-sized mobile science laboratory, touch down on Mars; others included the actor Morgan Freeman, the director Barry Sonnenfeld, the comedian Seth Green and the actress Nichelle Nichols (who played Lt. Uhura on the original Star Trek).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is not the first time that NASA has dabbled in music from outer space. The radio emissions of Saturn, recorded by the Cassini spacecraft, were shifted into audible frequencies, and the Kronos Quartet then incorporated the space sounds into a composition called "Sun Rings." In 2008, NASA celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Beatles song "Across the Universe" by transmitting it into deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the galaxy appears ungrateful. "Obviously, deep space hasn't sent us anything back," a NASA spokeswoman noted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOST technological advances are actually just improvements. One thing builds on the next: from shoddy to serviceable, from helpful to amazing. First you had a carriage, then a car, and then an airplane; now you have a jet. You improve on what is there. Technological advances are like that.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for the one that involved landing on the Moon. When a human went and stood on the Moon and looked back at the Earth, that was a different kind of breakthrough. Nothing tangible changed when Neil Armstrong's foot dug into the lunar dust and his eyes turned back at us. We didn't get faster wheels or smaller machines or more effective medicine. But we changed, fundamentally. What had been unknown, was known. What had been unseen was seen. And our human horizon popped out 200,000 miles. Forever, we would see the Earth differently, because we had seen it from someplace truly foreign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why Mars is important. When we get a human to Mars -- in the next few decades, NASA has predicted -- our horizon will expand 1,000 times farther, and it will never go back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching the first images from the rover, Curiosity, which landed on Mars early this month, I was reminded of a short story by Ray Bradbury called ''Mars Is Heaven!'' In it, Mars is populated by aliens who fool visiting Earthlings into thinking they're in a familiar environment before murdering them. It's about how stupid nostalgia is, how it tricks us into wanting things that were never that great in the first place. What strikes me about the story is that, just over 60 years ago, someone could seriously write about aliens on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you imagine what it was like then? Mars was an impossible frontier; we wouldn't even have decent pictures of the planet until almost 20 years after the story was published. Now it reads like a fairy tale in which the moon is made of cheese, or the sun is a horse-drawn chariot bearing a god, or the stars move in crystal spheres around the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When humanity was in its infancy, we thought the universe revolved around us. Then, with Copernicus, we aged into heliocentrism, became aware we were one of a family of planets inside the walls of our house, the solar system. Nearby stars gather like a town, rotating through the galaxy, our country. Clusters are like continents. We realized in stages that we were very insignificant. And then, almost like grown-ups, we pulled our boots on and began to try to leave a significant mark anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't get anywhere by staying home from Mars. By pushing our little mine carts around the earth and making speedier mine carts, by connecting long pipes to communicate with one another and then creating better pipes to shout down, louder ways to shout. All of our squabbles with other humans and all of our possessions here on earth, the things we make faster, easier, smaller, really mean very little. How could they, when the universe is so big? Significance is in science -- not the science that leads to better mine carts and more efficient shouting, but the science that leads to more ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember Plato's allegory of the cave. In the cave, the people look at shadows moving on the wall. They watch the shadows move, and they think that's living. What if they could go outside and see the sun? That's us, moving from the Earth to the Moon. That's Neil Armstrong, who died at the age of 82 over the weekend, standing on the Moon, and looking back at Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing about the cave is, it's not just one cave. It's more caves, and more, all nested within one another. The Moon was our first cave; Mars will be next. And then there will be another cave, and another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people scoff at sending humans to Mars, and say that pictures of wheel marks on a red desert are not worth the trouble when there are so many things here at home that we could be spending money on, it makes me claustrophobic. It's as if we're trying, out of guilt or shame, to crawl back into the cave and watch the shadows on the wall. We're trying to stay children in our parents' house, knowing that the road leads to town, and then to another town. We're saying, ''Look, we made a really great toilet that flushes itself! Remember that printing press? That was pretty neat. We even made pyramids -- those things are huge! Can't we just be happy with making a great toilet even greater? Do we really have to go to Mars?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mars is waiting. It spins now outside our human reach. We must realize that the work of growing up is not something we can cut when the budget gets tight. It is mission critical, for the intellectual life of the species, for the future of humans, not to stagnate, not to wither, but to stretch, and reach, and always to expand.</p>

It is a welcome development given increasingly tight budgets for robotic explorations of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two automated rovers have been on the surface of Mars for many years and have made important discoveries about ancient wet environments on the planet that may have been favorable for microbial life.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many space scientists worried that the Curiosity would be a last hurrah for planetary exploration for years to come because of constraints on NASA's exploration budget, the agency unveiled a new mission on Monday to examine the internal structure of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, named InSight, will land a package of instruments in 2016 that can take seismic readings from the interior, dig 16 feet below the surface to measure heat flows and detect how the planet wobbles in orbit. From this geophysical, subsurface data, scientists expect to understand whether the planet's core is solid or liquid, why the crust of Mars is not divided into tectonic plates like those that drift and cause quakes on Earth, and what forces shaped the rocky inner planets of the solar system, including Earth, more than four billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever is learned from Curiosity and InSight will advance scientific knowledge and might well be useful in planning potential manned missions.</p>

The entire trip took about 16 minutes, with most of the time spent stopped as cameras took photographs of the progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the team behind Curiosity, the six-wheeled NASA rover that landed on Mars 17 days ago, the first tracks in the dust on Wednesday were an exciting milestone.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It couldn't be more important,'' Peter C. Theisinger, the mission's project manager, said at a post-drive news conference. ''I mean, we built a rover. So unless the rover roves, we really haven't accomplished anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity is to spend at least a couple of years roving through a 96-mile-wide crater and up a 3.4-mile-high mountain at the center of the crater, exploring for signs that early Mars could have been habitable for microbial life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that journey of miles started with a roll of a few feet away from Bradbury Landing, where Curiosity set down on Aug. 6. NASA said on Wednesday that the spot had been named for Ray Bradbury, the author of ''The Martian Chronicles'' and other influential science-fiction novels, who died in June. He would have turned 92 on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Curiosity has been busy with other exercises, like vaporizing Martian rocks and seeing what they are made of (basalt, apparently, or something similar). On Sunday, the rover fired a laser instrument for the first time, hitting a rock with 30 bursts in 10 seconds and analyzing the atomic makeup from the resulting flashes of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, it flexed its arm. On Tuesday, it wiggled its four corner wheels in preparation for the drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything has been going extremely well,'' Mr. Theisinger said. ''Really extremely well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having succeeded at rock-zapping on Sunday, scientists turned the laser, which was developed at <span class="companylink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span>, to vaporize small bits at six more locations. So far, most of the rocks appear to be a type, common on Mars, that forms from the rapid cooling of lava.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another instrument, provided by Russia, has started firing neutrons into the soil to look for hydrogen, which would point to the presence of water. The rover has also gradually started science observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the only broken piece has been a wind sensor that may have been knocked out by rocks kicked up during the landing, NASA said. A second wind sensor is working properly, as is the rest of the rover's weather station, which was contributed by Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station has measured swings in air temperature from minus-103 degrees to 28 degrees Fahrenheit. Swings in ground temperatures have been even greater, from minus-132 degrees to 37 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the next week, as more instruments are checked out, Curiosity may conduct its first analysis of the makeup of the Martian atmosphere. When that is complete, it is to head to its first destination, called Glenelg, where three types of terrain appear to intersect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Curiosity will move only about 30 feet at a time. As its engineers gain experience, the drives will stretch to longer than the length of a football field, relying on the rover's ability to navigate for itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Theisinger, the project manager, cautioned that the early successes did not ensure future ones; so far, the mission has checked off only two of its primary goals, to launch on time and to land on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a long way to go before this mission meets its full potential,'' he said. ''But the fact we haven't had any early problem is, in fact, fantastic.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What ever happened to the Goldilocks planet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was big news back in September 2010 when a group led by Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and R. Paul Butler of the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> said they had discovered a small planet circling a small red star in the constellation Libra, at a distance smack in the middle of the so-called Goldilocks zone -- that ''just right'' region where water on the surface is possible.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed, Gliese 581g, as it is known, would be the first known exoplanet -- that is, a planet outside our own solar system -- that could support life. But within weeks, a group of exoplanet astronomers based at the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland under the leadership of Michel Mayor said they could not find the planet in their own extensive data on the star. After other papers appeared questioning the statistical significance of the new planet, most astronomers consigned it to the bin of failed dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, however, Dr. Vogt and Dr. Butler struck back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper in the journal Astronomische Nachrichten (Astronomical Notes) they argued that the planet does indeed show up in the Swiss observations, if they are analyzed properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see the planet in their data,'' Dr. Butler said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new paper has raised eyebrows, but has so far changed few minds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail recently, Dr. Vogt said, ''The silence is telling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical was the response from Artie P. Hatzes, a former student of Dr. Vogt's who is now at the Thuringian State Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany, who said it pained him to see his old mentor sticking to a conclusion ''that is obviously wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hatzes called Gliese 581g ''a marginal detection'' that was not supported by additional data, something that happens often. ''I think that no amount of fancy analysis can replace having high-quality data and more of it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impasse has led some astronomers to suggest that an outsider look at the data, but everyone is too busy with his or her own research. In the two years since Gliese 581g (pronounced GLEE-za) was announced, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Kepler satellite has identified more than 2,300 candidate planets in a small portion of the Milky Way in the Cygnus constellation, which scientists are sifting in hopes of soon discovering what some call Earth 2.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing else, the dispute illustrates just how hard it is to find out what is going on only a short distance away in the universe. The star Gliese 581 is about 20 light-years away, next door in cosmic terms. The evidence for its planets comes from slight periodic variations in the star's velocity, caused by gravitational tugs of planets swirling around it. The heavier the planet and the closer it is to its star, the bigger the tug, so it can take years to build up and parse the data for an entire system -- the so-called wobble method.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was on this basis, using sensitive spectrography that goes by the acronym Harps on a telescope in Chile, that the Geneva team concluded by 2007 that there were four planets circling the star, two of them on either side of the ''habitable zone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, Dr. Vogt and his colleagues added two more planets based on their own observations with the Keck telescope in Hawaii, including the one in the middle of the habitable zone, circling the star every 37 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European astronomers were quick to say the new planet was not in their own data. But much to the annoyance of Dr. Vogt and his colleagues, that data was not made public for a year, in a paper posted to the Internet by Thierry Forveille of the Grenoble Observatory in France, the lead author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Forveille and his colleagues concluded that their data were best fit by a model in which Gliese 581 had four planets, one of which had an elongated elliptical orbit of 69 days. Such a planet could masquerade as one with half that orbital period, they said, perhaps explaining Dr. Vogt's planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Vogt and his colleagues contend that such an arrangement would be unstable, leading to colliding planets within 200,000 years. Redoing the analysis and assuming that the orbits were all circular, they found leftover data points that could be explained by a fifth planet with an orbit of about 32 days, snugly in the habitable zone, and a mass slightly more than twice that of Earth, essentially confirming their original Goldilocks claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting this new study published was a tricky problem. Because the Forveille data had not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, Dr. Vogt was not able to publish his analysis of that data in The Astrophysical Journal, the journal of choice for American astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they sent it to Astronomische Nachrichten, one of the oldest astronomy journals in the world, but rarely the venue today for groundbreaking news. ''So we will now publish their own data for them for all the world to see and analyze, and then judge for themselves whether the Swiss's rebuttal claims have any credibility,'' Dr. Vogt wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail, Dr. Forveille shrugged off the new report, writing that his own team's computer simulations showed that the planetary system with elliptical orbits was stable at least over 900,000 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More to the point, he and other astronomers said, was that Dr. Vogt's planet had a 4 percent chance of being a false alarm. That is far above the 1 percent chance normally considered a benchmark for planet detection, and much bigger than the margin Dr. Vogt and his colleagues had cited in their first paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Increasing false alarm probabilities with more data is of course never a good sign,'' Dr. Forveille said. Greg Laughlin of the University of California, Santa Cruz, an expert on planetary dynamics, said the chances of a false alarm rise to 12 percent when uncertainties about the star Gliese 581 itself -- stellar noise -- are added in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, Dr. Vogt still had ''a decent shot''of being right. It comes down to whether four planets with eccentric orbits or five planets with circular ones are a more economical fit to the data. Assuming that the planets' orbits all lie in the same plane, Dr. Laughlin explained, tips the balance toward the extra planet. But, of course, more data is needed. He said, ''I thus believe that it is likely that if the peak holds up as more data comes in, the planetary explanation is likely to be correct.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Ford, an astronomer at the University of Florida who is involved with Kepler, noted that Carl Sagan had maintained that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my judgment,'' Dr. Ford said, ''we do not have extraordinary evidence for the claimed planet Gliese 581g, at least not yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hatzes agreed, but added, ''I am sure this will not be the last we have heard of GL 581g.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- NASA's newest marvel, a one-ton rover named Curiosity, has been set down with all the delicacy of a carton of eggs on the surface of Mars. The perfect landing came after a complex series of automated maneuvers that had been tagged the ''seven minutes of terror,'' but that in the end were executed so flawlessly as to render the mission's Earthly handlers speechless with relief. There wasn't even a single error to report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On such evidence it could easily seem that planetary exploration is in the full bloom of vigorous good health under American leadership, thank you very much. There's little doubt that during the last decade the genre of robotic space exploration has reached an apex of achievement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, an apex already implies a fall, and the Obama administration's proposed NASA budget for 2013 seemingly wants to make that fall as immediate as possible, chopping $300 million from the agency's planetary science division -- a whopping 20 percent cut from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If such an evisceration is allowed to stand, the most cost-effective and successful division of NASA -- the very part of the agency that is actually exploring space with relatively economical robots, rather than flying astronauts expensively in the endless circularity of low Earth orbit -- will be reduced to a ghost of its former self. Curiosity could well be a swan song: NASA's final flagship interplanetary mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such cuts will also assure the demise of a fully elaborated and streamlined national infrastructure, one that knits together engineering talent, scientific expertise, technological innovation, spaceflight management, and communications systems that span the entire Solar System. This apparatus took five decades to build and constitutes one of the great achievements of our time. If it is allowed to come crashing down, it will be virtually impossible to replace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to be clear, these are the people and institutions that have produced some of the most cost-effective and powerful technologies ever conceived by the United States. Over the last five decades, NASA Planetary Science Division Voyagers and Vikings, its Magellan Venus radar mapper and Galileo Jupiter mission, its still-active Cassini Saturn orbiter and its ridiculously hardy Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity have opened up the entire Solar System to human eyes. Brought to us in scrupulous detail, a dazzling series of worlds and their moons have enlarged our collective sense of our location within space and time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's set aside the glories of discovery for the moment and look at space exploration's realpolitik. What do we get out of it, in concrete terms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, the money spent to achieve the exploration of the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn is money spent on Earth, not anywhere else. It powers innovative companies and develops technologies that inevitably -- and demonstrably -- benefit our economy and our national prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we go back all the way to the Apollo era, we'll soon see that it's no accident that each of us has the equivalent of a flawlessly miniaturized Mission Control on our digital desktops, with rows of icons standing in for Houston's rows of technicians seated at telemetry monitors, and each icon signifying a software application ready to do our bidding at a click.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our sublimely networked information-based civilization would have been inconceivable without the immense number of technological innovations spurred by NASA's push to land on the Moon. There would've been no Apple without Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this fruitful spillover of software and hardware innovation has cascaded forth from NASA programs ever since, irrigating Silicon Valley, among other places. Remarkably, even near-failures by the space agency have resulted in positive spin-off technologies that in turn have led directly to meaningful, tangible civilian applications capable of propelling economic progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the failure of NASA's Galileo orbiter to open its crucial high-gain antenna while en-route to Jupiter in 1990 resulted in a NASA-wide crash program intended to rescue the mission. The problem was that the spacecraft's underpowered omni-directional antenna, which had been intended for use only while Galileo was near Earth, was now the only way to receive data from a spacecraft more than 576 million miles away -- the greatest distance of Jupiter from Earth. And that antenna only had the feeble power of a 20 watt bulb, radiating energy wastefully in every direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeterred, NASA engineers devised an ingenious series of IT fixes, many of which involved developing or refining techniques for compressing and transmitting data through the keyhole of that impossibly faint signal. The result is that to this day, every time you send large documents across the Internet, or for that matter attach feather-light JPEG pictures to an e-mail and send them to a friend, you're directly benefiting from NASA research triggered by Galileo's antenna failure. (Meanwhile the mission itself was transformed from certain failure to remarkable success.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other wholly pragmatic reasons exist to pursue a vigorous program of interplanetary space exploration. These range from the utility of understanding the climatological stories of our neighboring terrestrial planets Venus and Mars (one of which swelters under a runaway greenhouse effect enforced by its dense atmosphere, with the other being a frigid desert world), to the usefulness of investigating the geology of near-Earth asteroids, and thus how they could potentially best be deflected from Earth-intersecting, and potentially civilization-ending, trajectories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally it bears repeating that in its entirety, meaning including human spaceflight and all its other divisions, NASA costs less than half of one percent of the federal budget -- a fraction of a penny on every tax dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the steady stream of high tech innovations that has streamed forth from the agency for decades, enriching our lives and bolstering our economy, the successful landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars should be an occasion not just to celebrate an astonishingly cool civilizational achievement, but also to renew our national commitment to the peaceful exploration of outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can start by restoring funding to the agency's prodigiously dynamic and successful interplanetary explorations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mishap was another blow to Russia's space program, which has been plagued by malfunctions, crashes and failed launchings. The failure was particularly glaring because it came just hours after NASA's successful landing of a research probe on Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging the starkly different outcomes, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri O. Rogozin, who oversees Russia's military industry, suggested in a Twitter post that the national space agency, Roscosmos, was struggling because of aging leadership. ''As long as the youngest Roscosmos director is 62, we can only dream of Mars rovers,'' Mr. Rogozin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause of the failure is under investigation, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellites, worth about $45 million, were intended to provide telecommunications services for Indonesian and Russian customers. They were carried by a Proton rocket, with a Briz-M booster, launched from Russia's Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the launching, the Briz-M booster activated as scheduled but switched off after only seven seconds instead of the more than 18 minutes needed to propel the satellites into the proper orbit, Roscosmos said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booster and the two satellites have ''not been detected on the transition orbit,'' the space agency said, but rather ''from the interim emergency orbit,'' indicating a failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Roscosmos spokesman said that space experts worldwide would monitor the lost satellites and that at least for the moment, they posed no danger to the International Space Station. ''We have many years of successful experience in ensuring the safety of the station,'' the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar malfunction with the Briz-M booster last August resulted in the loss of another communications satellite, which floated in space until March, when Russian scientists redirected it into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aleksandr Zheleznyakov, a scientist with the Federation of Russian Cosmonautics, said the latest mishap was ''a considerable blow to the industry's image, particularly taking into account our many setbacks in the last couple of years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the lost satellites, called the Telekom-3, was the first Russian-made satellite bought by Indonesia. In May, a Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner crashed in Indonesia during a demonstration flight for potential buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently snug in an interplanetary spacecraft, the plutonium-powered rover called Curiosity will end its eight-and-a-half-month journey from Earth on Sunday, plowing into the Martian atmosphere at 13,000 miles per hour in a burst of fire.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that happens, control over the $2.5 billion mission will transfer to the onboard computer, which must slow the car-sized Curiosity and execute a series of intricate maneuvers to lower it to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of a 14-minute communications gap between the two planets, scientists on Earth will be mere spectators. Landing was scheduled to occur at 10:31 p.m. Sunday here in Pasadena, though officials warned that confirmation of a successful touchdown could take several hours or even days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failure could set back American-led Mars explorations for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of tightening budgets, NASA has already pulled out of collaborations with the European Space Agency planned for 2016 and 2018. The space agency is now contemplating what alternative missions it can fly on its own to Mars in 2018 -- but nothing nearly as ambitious or expensive as Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity fails, NASA would have to start over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug McCuistion, the Mars exploration program director, said NASA would persist as it had following earlier Mars failures. After the loss of two Mars spacecraft in 1999, NASA then built and landed two highly successful rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off,'' Mr. McCuistion said at a news conference on Saturday. ''This will not be the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At landing time, two NASA craft, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey, will be passing close overhead, with Odyssey relaying transmissions to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the landing could pass without word from Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't necessarily mean something bad has happened,'' said Richard Cook, the deputy project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the landing succeeds, the first black-and-white photographs could be beamed back on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the first week, Curiosity is to deploy its main antenna, raise a mast containing cameras, a rock-vaporizing laser and other instruments, and take its first 360-degree panorama shot of its surroundings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA will spend the first month checking out Curiosity. Mr. Cook said the first drive could occur early next month. The rover would not scoop its first sample of Martian soil until mid-September at the earliest, and the first drilling into rock would occur in October or November, he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, a spacecraft containing Curiosity -- a car-size, nuclear-powered planet rover -- is coasting at 8,000 miles per hour toward Mars, nearing the end of a journey that began in November. With tightening budgets, it is the last big hurrah for NASA's planetary program for quite a few years. Packed with ingenious new instruments, the rover promises to provide the best-ever examination of the Red Planet, digging up clues to a profound question: Could there ever have been life there?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the coming week, the pull of gravity will accelerate the spacecraft to 13,000 miles per hour, and early Monday morning Eastern Daylight Time, it is scheduled to execute a series of astoundingly complicated maneuvers and place the rover on the surface. Its new home will be the Gale Crater, just south of the equator, a 96-mile-wide bowl punched out by a meteor more than 3.5 billion years ago. It is one of the lowest places on Mars, which should help advance Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission: studying the environment of early Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Water flows downhill, and that's where we're going,'' John P. Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> who serves as the mission's project scientist, said during a news conference this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bits of the Martian past may lie in the rocks at the bottom of the crater. Over the past decade, NASA's robotic spacecraft have turned up convincing evidence that eons ago the planet held one of the prerequisites for life. Water flowed on Mars, at least on occasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life's other prerequisites are carbon-based molecules and energy. Sunshine or volcanic heat could have provided the necessary energy. With Curiosity, the search is on for the carbon-based molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this is the Hubble Space Telescope of Mars exploration,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator in charge of the science mission directorate. (He is best known as the Hubble repairman, flying on three space shuttle missions to refurbish and upgrade the telescope.) ''This is the first time that we have a real analytical laboratory heading to the surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before Curiosity can make any discoveries, it has to land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the control room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., it will still be Sunday evening when the nervous wait begins. First will come word that the spacecraft containing Curiosity has entered the Martian atmosphere. Just seven minutes later, the spacecraft must flawlessly execute a series of complex maneuvers to land the rover on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, the friction of Mars' thin air rushing past the heat shield will have slowed the spacecraft to 1,000 miles per hour. A 51-foot-wide parachute will pop out, generating up to 65,000 pounds of drag force. Then the heat shield will pop off so that the radar can find the landing site in Gale Crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the parachute drag, the spacecraft will be barreling toward the surface at 200 miles per hour. Next it will cut away the parachute and ignite its descent engines to slow down further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last three NASA rovers -- Sojourner in 1997 and Spirit and Opportunity in 2004 -- had similar landing systems, except for the final step. For those three, a cocoon of air bags inflated around the rover, which was then dropped the last 50 feet or so, bouncing and rolling until it came to a stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Curiosity, about the size of a Mini Cooper, is five times as heavy as Spirit or Opportunity, making air bags impractical. It would be equivalent of trying to cushion a car hitting a brick wall at highway speed without any damage to the car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Curiosity will be lowered by cable all the way to the ground from the hovering rocket stage in what NASA calls a sky crane maneuver. Once Curiosity bumps into Mars at a gentle 1.7 miles per hour, the cable will be cut, and the rocket stage will fly off to crash about a third of a mile away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is it crazy?'' Doug McCuistion, director of NASA's Mars exploration program, asked rhetorically during the news conference. ''Well, not so much. Once you get comfortable, once you understand it, it's not a crazy concept.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA engineers who devised the sky crane maneuver say that after thorough testing of the different parts of the system and numerous computer simulations, they are confident that they have built something that will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the simulated world, we've landed on Mars millions of times,'' one of the engineers, Steven Lee, said in an interview. ''I'm actually very comfortable. I'm more comfortable with the impending landing than I was with the launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, success is not guaranteed. The Curiosity landing is the ''hardest NASA robotic mission ever attempted,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it survives, Curiosity will come to rest about 1:17 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter will be passing overhead, in position to relay radio transmissions from Curiosity to Earth. About 14 minutes later, the fate of Curiosity may be known at mission control. (NASA warns that with the vagaries of space communications, a day or two could pass before confirmation of a successful landing reaches Earth.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers and scientists will spend several weeks checking out the condition of the rover. A few photographs will be beamed back the first few days, first in black and white, then in color. One of the first chores will be a software upgrade for Curiosity's computers. The first drive is most likely more than a week after landing. The first flexing of the rover's robotic arm would occur after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a couple of months, we'll be on the road to Mount Sharp,'' said Dr. Grotzinger, the project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For reasons no one can quite explain, a three-mile-high mountain, Aeolis Mons, stands at the center of Gale Crater. Informally known as Mount Sharp, in honor of Robert P. Sharp, a pioneering planetary scientist at Caltech, it is taller than any mountain in the continental United States. Orbiting spacecraft have already observed that Mount Sharp consists of layered rocks presumably formed out of sediment that settled at the bottom of Gale over millions of years. Later the sediment was somehow scoured out, leaving Mount Sharp at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The layers, scientists believe, will provide a history book about early Mars. Orbiters have spotted at the base of the mountain signs of clays -- minerals that form in the presence of water and that point to an environment that was less acidic than present-day Mars. As Curiosity crawls up the mountain, it will roll across younger and younger rocks, and the changes could tell how the environment of Mars changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that task, Curiosity is carrying some of the most sophisticated science tools ever devised. A rock-vaporizing laser called ChemCam can turn a smidgen of rock into a puff of glowing, superhot gas from a distance of up to 25 feet. From the colors of light emitted by the gas, ChemCam can identify elements in the rock. A rock full of carbon, for example, would merit a closer look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is really designed to be a sentry or advance guard for the rover and identify the most interesting samples,'' said Roger C. Wiens, a physicist at <span class="companylink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span> who is the instrument's principal investigator. ChemCam can also vaporize dust on a rock to get a better look at its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other instruments include a weather station; a device that shoots particles into the rock and measures X-rays coming out; and several cameras, including one that mimics the hand lens of a geologist for close-up looks at rocks. The size of a microwave oven, the biggest and probably most ambitious of the instruments is called Sample Analysis at Mars -- Sam for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam contains 74 cups for studying ground-up rock. Most samples will be heated to 1,800 degrees, and three different instruments will be used to identify what gases are released, including the possibility of carbon-based molecules known as organics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confusingly, organic molecules can arise from nonliving chemical reactions, so the presence of organics would not prove the existence of life. Rather, the discovery of such molecules would add to the possibility of life on Mars long ago -- or perhaps even today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be the first search for organics since NASA's two Viking landers in 1976. The two Vikings saw no signs of organics, which led to the dispiriting conclusion that there was no possibility of life ever on Mars. (A separate experiment did have results consistent with the existence of microbes in the soil, but most scientists concluded that it was the result of some odd, nonliving chemical reactions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research a couple of years ago, however, suggested that the presence in the soil of chemicals known as perchlorates could have destroyed all of the organic molecules as the samples were being heated, thus giving misleading results. The Phoenix Mars lander discovered perchlorates in the Martian soil near the north pole in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam's ovens are hotter than the ones on the Vikings and should destroy the perchlorates before they destroy the organics, said Paul R. Mahaffy, the principal investigator of the Sam instrument. In addition, nine of the cups include a chemical solvent that would allow analysis at lower temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam will also analyze the atmosphere, possibly confirming controversial claims that it contains methane. Methane, broken apart by sunlight and chemical reactions, lasts only a few centuries. If there is methane in Mars's atmosphere, something must be making it -- perhaps microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main mission is scheduled to last two years. Then again, the last two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed for only three months of exploration. Spirit lasted six years, and Opportunity is still rolling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the earlier rovers, Curiosity is powered by plutonium, generating electricity from the heat of radioactive decay. It is the same type of power supply that the two Voyager spacecraft traveling at the distant reaches of the solar system have been running on for nearly 35 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Curiosity lands successfully, it, too, could operate for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm on the edge of my seat,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''I'm not going to sit back until it's safely on Mars.''</p>

Passing through a sun-driven shock wave at the edge of the solar system, it will reach the icy dominions of interstellar space. Voyager is one of the fastest vessels we've ever blown out of Earth's gravity well. Still, after three and a half decades of hyper-velocity spaceflight, it will take another 700 centuries for the craft to cross the distance to the nearest star.</p>

We had better start coming to terms with what that means for the human future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is we propel ourselves into space using much the same physics as the Chinese played with when they discovered what we came to call gunpowder more than 1,400 years ago. Blowing stuff up under us is just about the only way we know how to travel through the void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the distances between the stars, that method simply won't cut it. Even if we could find a way to increase the speed of our spacecraft a hundredfold -- about the same ratio of speeds between a horse-drawn cart and a 747 jet plane -- they would still take almost a thousand years to reach nearby stars, and as long to return. And while exciting theoretical research is under way into pilotless probes to the stars, the real possibility of large-scale human interstellar culture is considerably less thrilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. No salvation from population pressure on the shores of alien worlds. No release from the threats of biosphere degradation in the promise of new biospheres. No escape from our own destructive tendencies by spreading out among the stars like seedpods in the wind. For as many epochs in the future as there are epochs of human history in the past, we may simply have to make do, get by with what we have and, in the end, learn to get along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was just 15 when Voyager 1 left on its long journey. At that age I already knew I wanted nothing more than to be an astronomer. I was also sure that humanity's future, even on the time scale of centuries, would be played out in the theater of the stars. Voyager's departure on its interstellar mission convinced me we were well on our way toward that grand future where anything would be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today I am still in awe of that tiny box of electronics as it sails to the edge of the solar wind. I still believe it represents the best of human genius, ambition and hope. It is through these qualities that, I believe, we have taken the full measure of the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what we've learned in doing so brings me, as an adult and as an astrophysicist, to the hardest and most inconvenient truth of all. While our children's children's great-grandchildren will live with ever more powerful technology, they will also live ever more intimately with ever more billions of others in this, our corner of the cosmos. Looking back and forward, my bets are now on that same human genius, ambition and hope to rise to the occasion. We will have no other choice. There will be nowhere else to go for a very long time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space officials said the malfunction should not be considered a serious setback. The ship that malfunctioned had already docked with the station to unload supplies. It decoupled on Monday and backed off to try out the new autopilot, which has smaller hardware and is supposed to be more accurate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the glitch recalled the near-destruction of the Mir space station and the threat to its crew in 1997, when a Progress craft, experimenting with a remote-control approach, bumped into the module and ripped open a hole in the station's airtight skin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new case, there was no threat of a collision. The spaceship, a workhorse called Progress-M, was 100 miles away when the autopilot failed, the Russian space agency said in a statement. Controllers backed the vessel -- basically a flying cylinder with stubby space wings -- 300 miles from the station, and it will try to dock again on Sunday. If the autopilot fails again, the controllers will simply send the craft back to earth for an ocean landing, and engineers will set about fixing the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aleksandr Zheleznyakov, a scientist with the Federation of Russian Cosmonautics, said in a telephone interview that all hardware, including that for space, takes time to perfect. ''Failures and mishaps of all sorts are just par for the course in the creation of new equipment,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the glitch is the latest for the Russian system of rockets and manned and unmanned spacecraft, which the United States has relied on to keep American astronauts in orbit since the retirement of the space shuttle program, and before private-sector space transport is ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, a Russian rocket carrying a Progress ship sailed into a Siberian forest rather than into orbit because of a breakdown in its third-stage motor. This was alarming because NASA astronauts fly on similar rockets, as the only means for Americans to reach space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unmanned flights are less critical. The space agencies of Europe and Japan also launch cargo vehicles. In May, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, an American company, sent its first vessel, called a Dragon, to the space station.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a bad year to bet against Albert Einstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring physicists had to withdraw a sensational report that the subatomic particles known as neutrinos were going faster than light, Einstein's cosmic speed limit; they discovered they had plugged in a cable wrong.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have reported that they have explained one of the great mysteries of the space age, one that loomed for 30 years as a threat to the credibility of Einsteinian gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story starts with the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, which went past Jupiter and Saturn in the late 1970s and now are on their way out of the solar system. In the 1980s it became apparent that a mysterious force was slowing them down a little more than should have been expected from gravity of the Sun and planets..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was there an unknown planet or asteroid out there tugging on the spacecraft? Was it drag from interplanetary gas or dust? Something weird about the spacecraft? Or was something wrong in our calculation of gravity out there in the dark?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That last explanation would have been big news indeed. Much of what we know about the universe -- for example, the existence of dark matter, which seems to swaddle and shape the galaxies, and of dark energy, which seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe -- comes from presuming that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity as the warping of space-time geometry -- is correct over cosmic distances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General relativity has passed every test on Earth. Without correcting for it, GPS systems would not work. But some theorists have suggested that if gravity behaved differently over large distances from what Einstein thought, it would relieve astronomers of the embarrassing need to posit that 96 percent of the universe consists of various kinds of unknown dark stuff. A similar, but larger, kind of deviation from Einsteinian theory could explain the Pioneer anomaly, as it is called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pioneers 10 and 11 were launched in 1972 and 1973, respectively, and are now both about 10 billion miles out. They were last heard from in 2003, when the radio signal from Pioneer 10 got too weak to be detected. They were the first spacecraft to go past Jupiter and Saturn (though their biggest impact on pop culture until then might have been a controversy over the nude human figures on a plaque designed for the benefit of any distant aliens who might find them).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, however, when John D. Anderson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and his colleagues discovered that the spacecraft were running a little late on their timetable to eternity, it seemed as if general relativity might be up for grabs -- allowing the news media to ask their favorite science question: Was Einstein wrong? There was talk of a special deep space probe whose only mission would be to track its own movements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect was slight -- slowing the spacecraft by about 300 miles a year -- but the crack interplanetary navigators at J.P.L., who can slip a probe through Saturn's rings or buzz the moons of Jupiter, take great pride in their knowledge of the forces and foibles of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slava G. Turyshev, a Russian physicist and gravitational expert working at the laboratory, heard the challenge and took it on, feeling ''a sense of responsibility to get to the bottom of it.'' And so he set out to reconstruct the history of the Pioneer voyages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that would be easy. But the Pioneers spanned the history of the space age and also of the computer age, occasioning a major effort in what Dr. Turyshev calls ''space archaeology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues had to scour NASA labs for old punch cards and magnetic tapes and for vintage devices that could read the data stored on them -- then reformat all that data to a single modern standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, that meant ascertaining the positions of every antenna in NASA's Deep Space Network to an accuracy of one centimeter over all that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took much longer than Dr. Turyshev had imagined, and he had to depend on money from the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span> as well as from NASA to keep the project going, all the time aware that nobody was ever likely to retrace his footsteps. So he had better get it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more we learned, the less optimistic we became about new physics,'' he said. It became apparent that the fault with the Pioneers' travels turned out to lie not in the stars or the shape of space-time but in the spacecraft themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As designed, they radiated more heat in one direction from the circuits and generators that produced their electricity. And that imbalance, Dr. Turyshev and his colleagues concluded in a recent paper in Physical Review Letters, was all that was needed to explain the Pioneers' behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gravity did not need to be fixed. Einstein was right again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact he was doubly right, as it turns out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that light, of which heat radiation is one form, can carry momentum and thus a propulsive force is implicit in the basic equations of electromagnetism. A comet's tail, blown by sunlight, is one example. But it acquired new visceral meaning when Einstein, beginning in 1905, showed that light can be thought of as little particles -- now called photons -- that carry energy and momentum. As with bullets, if you shoot them in one direction, there will be a recoil in the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you drive at night, Dr. Turyshev explained, ''your high beams would emit photons and it would push you back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Pioneers' problem is that they have been driving the solar system with their high beams on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Turyshev said he had set out in search of new physics. When I asked him if he was disappointed at the final results, he laughed and replied: ''Of course. People were ready for something big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, the Einsteinian explanation ''also helps.'' The findings should help in designing new spacecraft for sensitive missions like measuring gravitational waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a win-win,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may dream of freaky new physics, but sometimes freaky old physics is all you need.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that they had spotted a fifth moon orbiting Pluto, which they already knew had four. The discovery, made with the Hubble Space Telescope, gives Pluto more moons than Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement, initially conveyed on Twitter, caught the attention of some science-minded comedians on the same medium. ''It's like, since being kicked out of the planet gang, it's decided to form a rival solar system,'' said Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist and stand-up comic in Britain. ''Good on Pluto, I say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of the moon, known simply as P5 for now, by itself does not change the terms of the ''Is Pluto a planet?'' debate. Moons are not a prerequisite for planethood -- unless one wanted to first expel Mercury and Venus, which are moonless -- and many smaller bodies are also known to have moons orbiting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that did not stop top planetary scientists from friendly taunting on Twitter. One comment came from Michael Brown, the astronomer at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> who discovered an object in the outer solar system that appeared larger than Pluto and set off the chain of events that culminated in the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet in 2006. ''The REAL implication of 5+ moons for Pluto?'' he wrote. ''Even things which aren't planets can be complicated and interesting. But you knew that. Right?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Just in case you are not certain of Dr. Brown's views, his Twitter name is ''plutokiller.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of NASA's New Horizon's spacecraft, which is currently speeding toward a close encounter with Pluto in July 2015, wrote a tart reply: ''Does CalTech cultivate old school ideas? Get used to planets unlike Earth ruling. Accept Nature. Breathe Mike. Breathe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the new moon could spell trouble for Dr. Stern and New Horizons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances that New Horizons would crash into P5 -- a tiny nugget most likely no wider than Manhattan is long -- or one of the other moons are vanishingly small. But Pluto could be enshrouded by smaller debris shed by the moons. With New Horizons flying through at 30,000 miles per hour, ''even small particles that weigh less than a milligram can be lethal to the spacecraft,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble pictures of Pluto, led by Mark Showalter, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Seti Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., were conducted to help identify safe regions for the NASA spacecraft. For now, not much is known about P5 other than that it is a speck of light, about one hundred-thousandth as bright as Pluto, that orbits at a distance of 26,000 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons team is coming up with a backup plan that would let it change the flyby -- currently planned to pass less than 7,000 miles above the surface of Pluto -- to a safer distance if it turns out that neighborhood is too cluttered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern said the mission would still meet all of its main objectives. ''That doesn't leave us in the poorhouse,'' he said. ''We don't get some of the icing of going up close.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 14, 2012, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the discovery of a fifth moon orbiting Pluto quoted incorrectly from a comment by Dean Burnett, a British neuroscientist and stand-up comic.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news came on the third day of the Farnborough International Airshow, where Airbus and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, the world's two largest commercial jet makers, announced nearly $7 billion in aircraft orders.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe this new vehicle will create a long overdue shake-up of the whole satellite industry, disrupting current norms and limitations,'' Mr. Branson said at a ceremony that also served to present formally a full-size model of SpaceShipTwo, a bullet-shaped craft that Virgin Galactic expects will carry its first tourists into space as early as next year for $200,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Virgin Galactic, George T. Whitesides, said four customers had already put down deposits to book satellite launchings on the new vehicle, called LauncherOne, which Virgin Galactic said could begin by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LauncherOne is a two-stage rocket capable of carrying payloads of up to 500 pounds into orbit for less than $10 million a launch. Like SpaceShipTwo, LauncherOne will be carried to an altitude of about 50,000 feet by the company's twin-fuselaged WhiteKnightTwo. LauncherOne will then fire its engines and lift the satellite into its final orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Virgin Galactic venture is part of an accelerating shift of the business of spaceflight -- once the near-exclusive domain of government space agencies -- to private enterprise. In May, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span> of California became the first private company to send a cargo rocket to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Branson's announcement came amid a break in the clouds and rain that have plagued much of the Farnborough show this year, a metaphor for the general gloom across the aerospace industry. The environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe and North America, has kept most airlines from signing significant aircraft orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's two top plane makers added a handful of deals to their order books on Wednesday. Airbus said it had received a new order from <span class="companylink">CIT Aerospace</span>, an American leasing company, for five more of its twin-aisle A330 aircraft, a deal worth $1.1 billion at list prices. The purchase follows a previously undisclosed order for five of the planes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Aircraft Leasing, of Hong Kong, agreed to buy 36 single-aisle A320 jets from the European company in an order worth $3.3 billion at list prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> won a commitment from another leasing company, Avolon of Ireland, to buy as many as 30 single-aisle 737s valued at about $2.3 billion at list prices.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video is called ''Seven Minutes of Terror,'' and describes, with the suspense and cinematography of a movie preview, what will happen next month when a one-ton spacecraft launched in November smacks into Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got literally seven minutes to get from the top of the atmosphere to the surface of Mars, going from 13,000 miles an hour to zero,'' Tom Rivellini, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> engineer, tells the camera with a grim face and deadpan delivery. ''If any one thing doesn't work just right, it's game over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Posted last month on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, the video has succeeded in an area where <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has a mixed track record: using social media and other tools of the 21st century to whip up interest in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite minimal publicity, ''Seven Minutes'' has been racking up views and attracting droll commentary on the impending arrival of the rover, which goes by the name of Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Come on, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>,'' one person said in a comment on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, ''All that is missing in this blockbuster trailer is Megan Fox as the chief scientist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe <span class="companylink">NASA</span> can get Mr. Moviefone to do the mission commentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the space agency's public utterances are dry stuff; recent news releases include ''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> Selects Contracts for Environmental Remediation Services'' and ''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> Awards Five Universities Funding for Learning Opportunities.'' Like other federal agencies, it is not allowed to spend money to toot its own horn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't try to market,'' said Robert Jacobs, a NASA spokesman. ''We don't try to sell anything. Our job is to clean the windows to give the American public a better view of their space program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet the space officials have tried to add a measure of cute and playful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> ran a contest to name a module on the International Space Station. But the comedian Stephen Colbert co-opted it, exhorting his viewers to vote for ''Colbert.'' That name ended up winning, with more than 230,000 votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NASA</span> put aside the results and named the module Tranquility, commemorating the landing site of Apollo 11. But the space agency did later name an exercise treadmill on the space station after Mr. Colbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the educational program for the James Webb Space Telescope, the planned successor to Hubble that has been troubled by delays and cost overruns, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> created a game in which players create their own space telescope, but to underwhelming reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Too bad this game is not totally realistic so as to let people play with schedule and cost,'' wrote Keith Cowing, a frequent critic of the space agency, on his Web site NASAWatch.com. ''This way they'd REALLY learn how <span class="companylink">NASA</span> satellites are built (or not built).''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> seems to have a hit. The ''Seven Minutes'' video, viewed more than half a million times, starts with a computer-generated animation of a capsule falling toward the Red Planet, then uses stark lighting, thumping music, fancy graphics and dramatic narration to tease the landing of the Curiosity, a $2.5 billion mission that aims to see if the building blocks of life existed on early Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the East Coast, the landing will happen in the wee hours of Monday, Aug. 6 -- or nighttime on Aug. 5 on the West Coast -- and it will be competing for mindspace with the Summer Olympics. That is not stopping the Atlanta Science Tavern, which organizes popular science talks, from going all out for an evening that starts with five talks on planetary science and segues into ''full-fledged party mode'' at midnight when <span class="companylink">NASA</span> television coverage of the landing starts. The festivities will conclude at 3 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already 173 people have signed up. ''It's science,'' said the group's director, Marc Merlin, ''but it's also a public celebration of scientific achievement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Merlin said he was thinking of bringing a model of the Mars rover that would descend on a rope a la the lighted ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve. ''That would be the decoration I would like to do,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, the seven minutes of terror will be more like 21 minutes of suspense. The capsule containing the Curiosity will hit the top of the Martian atmosphere just before 1:11 a.m. Eastern time on Aug. 6. The rover will be on the surface about seven minutes later. The only uncertainty is whether the rover will be in one piece or in smithereens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, no one will know the outcome for almost 14 minutes as the spacecraft's radio signals travel 150 million miles from Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people look at it, it looks crazy,'' says Adam Steltzner, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> engineer, in the ''Seven Minutes'' video as he describes the Rube Goldberg-esque landing process -- heat shield, parachute, rocket engines and finally a hovering crane that lowers the rover to the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Text flashes across the screen: ''6 vehicle configurations,'' then ''76 pyrotechnic charges.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy'' Mr. Steltzner goes on to say, before asserting more confidently, ''It is the result of reasoned engineering thought.'' Pause. ''But it still looks crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slick video is ''definitely a step up,'' said Reid Gower, a 26-year-old Canadian who was so frustrated by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s previous efforts that last year he put together <span class="companylink">NASA</span> snippets into a promotional video that he thought the space agency should be making. ''That's along the lines of what I feel they could be doing, something that's education but also engaging. It's not static and dry. It has emotional content in it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shenzhou 9 spacecraft will dock with the Tiangong 1 orbital module ''sometime in mid-June,'' according to Xinhua, China's official news agency, quoting an unidentified spokesman for the country's space program.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six weeks after the Enterprise made its New York City debut on the back of a 747 jet, it completed its oft-delayed journey to Manhattan in appropriately slow motion. The final act was a precise water ballet involving the shuttle, two barges, three tugboats, a huge floating crane and an aircraft carrier.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, witnessed by a rapt crowd of several hundred people on piers along the Hudson River, was to pluck the shuttle off the smaller of the barges and hoist it up to the flight deck of the Intrepid, a retired carrier docked on the West Side that is now the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum</span>. Enterprise, which was built in 1976 and was the prototype for the shuttles that flew in space, will be its star attraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 3:45 p.m., about four hours after it arrived in a procession up the river, the crane hoisted the 75-ton shuttle off the barge. When Enterprise was more than 50 feet in the air, the 240-foot boom pivoted into a stiffening breeze and slowly swung the shuttle tail-first over the Intrepid. The crane's cables sang a shrill tune as Enterprise descended to the deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4:02 p.m., the Enterprise had landed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's somewhat surreal still,'' Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the president of the museum, said as she gazed at the giant model spacecraft perched atop the ship, its nose pointed at New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intrepid was not known for its connections to the space program, but Ms. Marenoff-Zausner and her colleagues managed to persuade the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> to award one of the shuttles to the museum last year. That decision was criticized in Texas, Seattle and some other hubs of the aerospace industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Enterprise had been on display at a branch of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Virginia. When NASA awarded one of the retired orbiters, Discovery, to the Smithsonian, the agency decided that Enterprise would receive the most exposure in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the foundation that runs the Intrepid had to do was pay NASA about $10 million to deliver Enterprise to Kennedy International Airport and then figure out how to get the shuttle onto the ship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few days of weather delays, NASA did its part on April 27, with a throng-pleasing flyover of the city. On Sunday, a tugboat towed the shuttle aboard a barge from the airport around Queens and Brooklyn to Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, after another weather delay, tugs pushed that barge and a much bigger one holding the crane up the Hudson on Wednesday morning. They were saluted by onlookers lining the waterfront and a flotilla that included police boats, ferries, pleasure craft and fireboats spraying water in high arcs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After making U-turns in the river, the tugs parallel-parked the barges near the stern of the retired carrier. Crews of workers in red coveralls and orange flotation vests carefully trussed up the shuttle, attaching a yellow steel sling at four points on the sides of its fuselage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The floating crane, the same one that was used to extricate the <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> plane that Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III had landed nearby in the Hudson in 2009, then lifted the shuttle off the barge. About 15 minutes later, the Enterprise was resting atop the ship and workers were welding the brace behind its front wheels to the flight deck as Matt Woods, the museum's senior vice president for facilities and engineering, watched with relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We battled every element: wind, rain, the tides,'' said Mr. Woods, who got only four hours of sleep in a trailer next to the shuttle in Jersey City on Tuesday night. But on Wednesday, he said, ''Everything went perfect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the week, he said, he expected his crew to have erected a nylon tent over the shuttle to serve as its temporary home. The museum's trustees hope to find a place to erect a building to house Enterprise permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until then, space buffs will have to pay an additional $6, on top of the regular $22 admission, to enter the shuttle exhibit. It is scheduled to open on July 19.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, a small black dot will begin moving across the face of the Sun, an event that is turning New York City -- not usually an epicenter of astronomy -- into an interplanetary kind of town, with astronomy buffs and telescope jockeys in parks, on street corners and along piers. The rare astronomical event, known as the transit of Venus, comes in pairs about once every century, with the previous one occurring in 2004. The next one will not take place until 2117, making the event on Tuesday truly a last-chance opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless, of course, it rains.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the forecast, which is for clouds and possible rain, astronomy groups are setting up viewing sites around the city, including Union Square, the High Line, Riverside Park South and 125th Street in Harlem, where the temporarily star-struck can go to see the transit safely. It occurs when the orbits of Venus, Earth and the Sun put them into alignment along the same plane. Watching it with the naked eye is dangerous, and all but impossible, given the Sun's blinding glare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the viewing sites, amateur astronomers and academics will have telescopes with special solar filters, as well as projection devices and solar glasses, available to the public. ''In a sense, it is an eclipse,'' said Summer Ash, director of outreach for Columbia University's astronomy department, who will be stationed in the southeast corner of Union Square. ''It's the same phenomenon. It's just that Venus is so much farther away than the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, the transit of Venus, weather permitting, will be visible until sundown, at 8:24, letting New Yorkers see just the first third of the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1700s, scientists realized that the transit of Venus could help determine the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Mathematical models and diagrams stemming from the 1769 transit put the distance at 95 million miles, just 2 million more than what is now accepted to be the average distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we know the distance between the Earth and the Sun, we can use that to get distances to other stars,'' said Jason Kendall, a board member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York and a volunteer ''solar system ambassador'' for NASA. ''Ultimately, the transit of Venus gave us a fundamental measuring stick for all distances in the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kendall will oversee a viewing platform on a pier in Riverside Park South, near 68th Street, on the Upper West Side. He will bring a projection device, fashioned from an inexpensive telescope and a funnel covered with a fabric screen. He is expecting about a dozen other amateur astronomers to bring their own telescopes outfitted with solar filters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other prime locations are also along the Hudson River, with clear views of the sunset: a section of the High Line park, at 14th Street, and the concrete pier at the <span class="companylink">Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum</span>, at 12th Avenue and 46th Street. At the Intrepid, a nonprofit group, NYSkies Astronomy Inc., will have several specially equipped telescopes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Pazmino, the group's co-founder, remembers watching the 2004 transit from Carl Schurz Park on the Upper East Side, when the event was in progress as the sun rose. Conditions were such that the transit was visible with the naked eye. ''There was a very dense haze so that you could look at the Sun directly and most people, including myself, did see Venus,'' he said. ''The sun was orangy, like a pumpkin, and it looked like someone took a pin and poked it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Harlem, Columbia's astronomy department will invite the public to have a look from a sidewalk on 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. There will be projection devices, which allow for multiple views at one time, along with solar glasses and special solar telescopes. ''We're bringing astronomy to people where they are not necessarily looking for it,'' Ms. Ash said. ''Instead of prime locations where a lot of the amateur astronomy community will be, we prefer crowded streetscapes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the clouds conspire to turn the transit into a nonevent here, there is always video. NASA's Web site will be live-streaming the transit from an observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii starting at 5:30 p.m., Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span> will link to NASA's webcast, projecting a portion of the transit on a large screen in its Cullman Hall of the Universe, to be followed by a related film in the Hayden Planetarium. Mr. Kendall was already feeling the tug of the museum's big screen. ''If it's very cloudy, I might pack up my stuff and go there,'' he said. At the Intrepid, Mr. Pazmino vowed to wait and watch, no matter the weather. ''Our philosophy,'' he said, ''is to let Mother Nature kill the event, not human nature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while, according to NASA, there have been 53 transits since 2000 B.C., this is believed to be the first one with its own Twitter hashtag: #venustransit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VENUS slides between us and the Sun today, an exceedingly rare spectacle that scientists hope will expand their understanding of our solar system and refine their inquiries about distant planets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A transit of Venus has been recorded just six times before; one will not recur until 2117. Each time, astronomers understand it far better than we did the last time; when it is over, our curiosity only grows. Each time, too, it stirs our imaginations. The 1882 transit inspired Edmond-Louis Dupain to paint, on a ceiling at the Paris Observatory, a near-nude Venus, goddess of love, floating across the path of the sun god Helios in his chariot in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you view the real sky this afternoon -- using a safe solar filter if you look directly, or viewing it on a projected image -- you will see a dark spot cross the Sun, its diameter one-thirtieth the size of the Sun's, and so round it might seem a bullet had pierced our star. Four NASA spacecraft will be observing, too -- including two that will measure a drop of about one-tenth of 1 percent in the solar energy that reaches the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By measuring variations in this reduction of light during the transit, we hope to get clues about what happens when any planet, including so-called exoplanets far out in the universe, transits its star. NASA's Kepler spacecraft has found more than 2,000 suspected exoplanets; perhaps 90 percent really are exoplanets, but nobody knows which 90 percent. Insights from this transit may help us find an answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such ambitions could not have been imagined by Johannes Kepler, who observed that planetary orbits were elliptical, not circular (as even Copernicus had thought), and predicted the 1631 transit. Nobody recorded seeing it, but in 1639, 21-year-old Jeremiah Horrocks anticipated another transit, and it became the first ever observed. Horrocks also realized that transits occurred in eight-year pairs, with more than a century between one pair and the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 100 expeditions, from many countries, were sent to observe the next pair, in 1761 and 1769, in hopes that timing a transit would help to determine the solar system's size. The method had been devised by Edmund Halley, of comet fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Admiralty sent a lieutenant, James Cook, to Tahiti, bringing scientists to watch the 1769 transit; he then explored the South Seas (and became a captain). The French abbe Jean-Baptiste Chappe d'Auteroche made his way across Siberia in 1761 for the first transit, then perished in Baja California in 1769, after witnessing the second. He had fallen victim to an epidemic, thought to be typhus, in his quest for the best observation point. It was written of him that he survived to see a lunar eclipse weeks later and died a happy man, having accomplished his aims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less gratified was the French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil. After the British prevented him from landing in Pondicherry, India, to observe the transit of 1761, he stayed in Asia until the next transit, since it was only eight years away. But last-minute clouds spoiled his observations in 1769, and when he sailed home, he found he had been declared dead and his finances had been plundered. Only after a struggle did he reassemble his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next transits, in 1874 and 1882, even newfangled dry-plate photography could not overcome the so-called black-drop effect, an optical phenomenon in which Venus, for about a minute after it enters the solar disk, appears as a mysterious, dark, teardrop-like shape linked to the sky outside. A century before, the resulting uncertainty in timing the transit had limited the accuracy of Halley's plan for measuring the solar system. And it would take spacecraft observations of a transit of Mercury in 1999 before the black-drop effect mystery was solved. (Glenn Schneider of the University of Arizona and I deduced that an effect of the sun's gaseous nature helped explain the phenomenon -- as a result of darkening near the sun's edge and the limits of optical imaging.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the 2004 transit, a NASA spacecraft that we had helped program surprised us by revealing Venus's atmosphere in an arc around the planet's trailing side when half of the planet had entered the solar disk. The atmosphere appeared again, with its arc fading and diminishing, as Venus exited the Sun, like a baby leaving the womb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now my colleagues, students and I hope to make even better observations of Venus's exotic atmosphere when it is backlit by the sun. From North America (except for Alaska and northwestern Canada), only the first hours of transit will be visible before sunset, so we will observe from the solar observatory atop Haleakala, a dormant volcano 10,000 feet tall on the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All six hours of transit will be visible, and the skies are extremely clear here. We are also collaborating with scientists monitoring orbiting spacecraft. We hope to learn not only about the Cytherean atmosphere (in a common story, Roman Venus's Greek equivalent, Aphrodite, was born in the sea near Cythera), but also about how to detect and precisely categorize atmospheres around some exoplanets. The Kepler craft is trying to detect Earthlike planets in the habitable zone near distant stars -- the ''Goldilocks region'' that is not too hot and not too cold for water to be in liquid or gaseous or solid states. Transit observations from Earth may help reach that goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other scientists are using the Hubble Space Telescope, which is orbiting Earth, to try to detect how molecules in Venus's atmosphere affect the sunlight that reaches the moon. Our group has also teamed with others to obtain time on NASA's Cassini mission, which is orbiting in the Saturn system, to try to detect a very tiny drop in the Sun's intensity when Venus goes in transit from that vantage point on Dec. 21. And from Jupiter's vantage point (with reflected light monitored with the Hubble telescope), we hope Hubble can see Venus transit the Sun later this year, and Earth transit the Sun in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, people on Earth can see with their own eyes the beauty spot -- as beautiful as Marilyn Monroe's -- bestowed by Venus on the Sun. It is also a chance to appreciate the dividends we earn from our investments in space research, and the opportunities the universe throws our way to unlock its secrets.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phone call came like a bolt out of the blue, so to speak, in January 2011. On the other end of the line was someone from the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the nation's fleet of spy satellites. They had some spare, unused ''hardware'' to get rid of. Was NASA interested?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when John Grunsfeld, the physicist and former astronaut, walked into his office a year later to start his new job as NASA's associate administrator for space science, he discovered that his potential armada was a bit bigger than he knew.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in a room in upstate New York were two telescopes the same size as the famed Hubble Space Telescope, but built to point down at the Earth, instead of up at the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, struggling to get human space exploration moving again, had spent the previous year trying to figure out how good these telescopes were and what, if anything, they could be used for. Working with a small band of astronomers for the past couple of months, Dr. Grunsfeld, famous as the Hubble telescope's in-orbit repairman, has now come up with a plan, which was presented to the public on Monday at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is to turn one of the telescopes loose on the cosmos, pointing in its rightful direction, outward, to investigate the mysterious dark energy that is speeding up the universe's expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the plan succeeds -- and Congress, the Office of Management and Budget and the Academy of Sciences have yet to sign on -- it could shave hundreds of millions of dollars and several years off a quest that many scientists say is the most fundamental of our time and that NASA had said it could not undertake until 2024 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a total game changer,'' said David N. Spergel of Princeton, who is co-chairman of a committee on astronomy and astrophysics for the National Academy of Sciences, which sets priorities for NASA and other agencies. Alan Dressler, of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., who reported to the Academy committee on the scientific potential of a mission with the NRO-1 telescope, as astronomers are calling it, said he was ''really excited.'' He told the gathering, ''I think this is a tremendous opportunity for this community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the two telescopes and some spare parts are still in their clean room at <span class="companylink">ITT Exelis</span>, in Rochester. Michael Moore, who, as NASA's acting deputy director for astrophysics, took the original call last year, has been to see the telescopes several times. He called their optics ''astounding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld described the telescopes as ''bits and pieces'' in various stages of assembly, lacking a camera and other accouterments, like solar panels or pointing controls, of a spacecraft. ''We can't say what they were used for,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the National Reconnaissance Office, Loretta Desio, said, ''This is not something we're going to talk about,'' adding, ''We're hoping this becomes a NASA story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two telescopes have a 94-inch-diameter primary mirror, just like Hubble, but are shorter in focal length, giving them a wider field of view: ''Stubby Hubbles,'' in the words of Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, adding, ''They were clearly designed to look down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said his first reaction was that the telescopes would be a distraction. ''We were getting something very expensive to handle and store,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring he asked a small group of astronomers if one of the telescopes could be used as they were to study dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, he said, was: ''Don't change a thing. It's perfect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have lobbied for a space mission to investigate dark energy ever since observations of the exploding stars known as supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe was speeding up, the discovery that won three American astronomers the Nobel Prize. The fate of the universe, as well as the nature of physics, scientists say, depends on the nature of this dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a decade of wrangling between agencies and astronomers over money and technical specifications had resulted in no consensus on a mission until 2010, when a committee of the National Academy of Sciences that was charged with determining astronomical priorities cobbled together a plan that would do the trick. In its report, ''New Worlds, New Horizons,'' the committee gave that mission the highest priority in space science for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.5-billion project was called Wfirst, for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Among its virtues was that it would search for exoplanets -- planets beyond our solar system. But NASA, hobbled by mismanagement of the James Webb Space Telescope, has said that it will have no money to launch Wfirst until 2024 or later, if all goes well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, given a green light and some money, a mission with the repurposed telescope could be started in 2020. But, Mr. Moore added, ''We have no money.'' Building the telescope can amount to a quarter to a half of the cost of a space astrophysics mission, astronomers said. Dr. Moore estimated that having it already could save the nation $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope's short length means its camera could have the wide field of view necessary to inspect large areas of the sky for supernovae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even bigger advantages come, astronomers say, from the fact that the telescope's diameter, 94 inches, is twice as big as that contemplated for Wfirst, giving it four times the light-gathering power, from which a whole host of savings cascade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of requiring an expensive launch to a solar orbit, the telescope can operate in geosynchronous Earth orbit, complete its survey of the sky four times faster, and download data to the Earth faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a coronagraph, which blocks light from the sun's disk to look for exoplanets, another of Wfirst's goals, the former spy telescope could see planets down to the size of Jupiter around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sounds almost too good to be true, it might be, cautioned Adam Riess, one of the three dark energy Nobelists, who noted that a thorough estimate of the new mission's costs had not been done yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But still, he said, ''When someone hands you a hand-me-down like that, you have to be excited,'' Dr Riess said. ''They're not sitting around at <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld said the repurposing of the telescope for dark energy came at a personal cost. He had long dreamed that the Hubble, which he and the other astronaut servicing teams had said goodbye to forever in 2009, might be visited again and upgraded one more time to do the dark energy work. That dream, he admitted, was now dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If for half the cost, you could turn this into a telescope, why would you do that?'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a nearly flawless nine-day routine, the Dragon stuck the landing, too.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first commercial mission to ferry supplies into space ended successfully Thursday when a cargo capsule known as the Dragon fell to earth on target in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico, NASA officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tethered to three large parachutes, the unmanned capsule, which had carried about 1,100 pounds of food, water, clothing and equipment to the International Space Station, hit the water at the relatively gentle speed of about 10 miles an hour at 8:42 a.m. local time. It came down about 560 miles west of Baja California, witnessed by technicians from the company that built and flew it, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. They were to load the capsule aboard a barge and haul it back to Long Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This really couldn't have gone better,'' Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said at a televised news conference from the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. ''I'm overwhelmed with joy. It's been 10 years, and to have it go so well is incredibly satisfying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remote-controlled Dragon had separated from the space station about seven hours before splashdown, eventually firing rockets to slow it enough so that it would descend through the atmosphere. Before separation, the station's astronauts loaded it with about 1,400 pounds of used equipment, experiment samples and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the success of what amounted to a trial run for the spacecraft -- there were only a few minor problems during the mission, which began when the Dragon was launched atop a <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rocket from Florida on May 22 -- the company is now poised to begin regular supply missions, with much bigger payloads, to the space station later this year. Since the space shuttle program ended last year, the station has been resupplied by Russian and European spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has been the most successful participant in the government's long-term plan to shift the business of spaceflight to private enterprise, with NASA acting only as managers. The agency's $1.6 billion contract with the company for 12 supply flights still awaits final approval, but Alan J. Lindenmoyer, NASA's manager for commercial spaceflight, said at the news conference that he expected the approval to come quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We became your customer today,'' Mr. Lindenmoyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said that the first regular cargo mission could come by late summer. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also hopes to win a NASA competition to ferry astronauts to the space station, using a larger rocket. And Mr. Musk talks often of an even grander goal: sending humans to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The completion of the Dragon flight, Mr. Musk said, ''really shows that commercial spaceflight can be successful.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its space shuttle in retirement, NASA is now preparing to land humans on Mars. The other Mars, that is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To set foot on a more down-to-earth model, all anyone needs is a slight suspension of disbelief. On arrival, Tom Sachs will be waiting - by the espresso machine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sculptor best known for his duct tape, foamcore and construction-barrier reproductions of Modernist furniture and buildings, guns, Hello Kitty dolls and even Nazi death camps, Sachs is now leading visitors to the Park Avenue Armory around his own private Red Planet. Temporarily ensconced within the armory's vast Wade Thompson Drill Hall, it has a beer cooler, a hot peanuts dispensary and the aforementioned espresso machine, all stripped of polish and ready to rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Definitely bring the kids. ''Space Program: Mars,'' a collaboration between Sachs, Creative Time and the armory, is an inner-space playground for the whole family. It's also a serious artwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sachs, 44, has been developing his own space program since at least 2006, when his full-scale, plywood Lunar Landing Module set down at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles. The same structure, newly outfitted with a functioning bar, toilet, ''fecal stimulant'' and command center, now sits on a launch pad at the center of the space, surrounded by red plywood berms that stand in for the Mars terrain, lit by a ''sun'' of bright lights mounted on a large, tripod-supported disc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under ''Colonel'' Sachs's command, a crew of 20 highly trained technicians carries out its exploration and survival mission with a precision that would be the envy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Their tasks include ritualized routines that involve dispensing food (the aforementioned foil-wrapped hot peanuts), collecting scientific samples, testing rockets, running a daily exercise regimen, churning out a hand-stitched 'zine documenting the mission every week and exploring the space in a working replica of a NASA rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors who want to do more than just look around must first undergo ''indoctrination'' in Sachs's dictatorial work ethic before they can join the team and enter the capsule. That means performing menial tasks (sweeping floors, sorting nails), watching a series of instructional films in a screening room and stamping brown paper bags for popcorn with the mission logo. Also on view is that part of the American psyche that subscribes to Manifest Destiny, where no frontier is out of reach of the imagination - ground zero for an artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sachs, whose code name for the moment is Tango Sierra, science is the only true religion and ''Space Program: Mars'' is his D.I.Y. temple to it, and the culmination of all of his work since his first show in New York, in 1995, when he introduced the products he branded as ''Cultural Prosthetics'' - guns made of discarded hardware and cut-up Con Ed barriers, monochromatic duct-tape paintings and Hello Kitty icons, and taped foamcore Knoll furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the armory, his ultimate goal is to answer the age-old cosmic question ''Are we alone?'' Because his show is really about life on Earth, the answer is a conclusive no. ''Exploring other planets,'' he said at a preview on Tuesday, ''is a way of studying Earth and understanding how precious life is right here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also how fun. Personally, I had a great time exploring this Mars. First, I watched an utterly realistic demonstration of a rocket launch displayed on the bank of monitors that make up Sachs's Mission Control center. Later I discovered the rocket was actually a foot-long, handmade model contained within a tool cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going to another planet, Sachs had said, also means considering how we interact with it, especially when we try to colonize it. That usually means bringing the comforts of home to it. To that end, the Sachs studio has imported the culture of the handmade object, something increasingly precious in a society that worships packaging and branding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One import is a domed, tatami-matted teahouse made of Sachs's signature Con Ed barriers. On a separate platform, friendly crew members, all dressed in white pants, ties and shirts with Mars mission pocket protectors, roasted tasty peanuts under the heat of a clamp light, and then sent them down a conveyor belt for collection in a bathtub wheelbarrow. Others dispensed ice-cold vodka and beer from a black refrigerator as tall as Darth Vader and topped with the character's helmet. Another station was a galley kitchen serving rice and beans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What looked like a pinball machine was in fact the ''rescue'' station, where a crew member manipulated a plastic yellow helicopter that picked up a space capsule that had just splashed down at sea and moved it to a model aircraft carrier. Beside it, in a Winnebago where astronauts suited up in a quarantined area, was a red phone on which successful astronauts could talk to the president - Nixon, in this case, who delivers an actual speech (written by William Safire) that was prepared in case real-life astronauts were stranded on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best part of this experience was going into the air-conditioned landing module and examining (though not trying) the toilet and looking through the library, where there were copies of ''Ulysses,'' ''Origin of the Species,'' ''Remembrance of Things Past'' and other bibles of Sachs's religion. Though it weighs 22,000 pounds, it takes only four casters of compressed air to lift it a few inches off the floor, which will happen at the end of the ''mission.'' All I know is that I was so comfortable up there, I didn't want to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''Space Program: Mars'' isn't all fun and games. The basic idea is to demonstrate how much labor is actually involved in mundane activities, and that there is life in every product, even if it's Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may strike some as sheer folly, a waste of time and foamcore. But all inventions seem like the outpourings of the mad, whether they work or not. Sachs is fetishizing the whole process and doing what sculptors always do - mold objects that change our perception of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's more to come. When the show closes, Sachs and his team of specialists will embark on a new mission: to Europa, Jupiter's moon. Speaking into a microphone that carried his voice over the program's P.A. system, Sachs said, ''Tango Sierra in ascent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sachs's ''Space Program: Mars'' continues through June 17 at the Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, New York. The crew performs demonstrations for the public every Thursday from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that penultimate act, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, made history as the first private company to send a craft, the Dragon, to the station.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grab -- which NASA refers to as a grapple -- occurred at 9:56 a.m. Eastern time on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks like we've got us a Dragon by the tail,'' said Donald R. Pettit, the NASA astronaut on the station who was operating the robotic arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andre Kuipers, an European Space Agency astronaut, then took over the robotic arm to pull the Dragon to a docking port on the station, locking it there just after noon. After the hatches are opened on Saturday, the astronauts aboard the station will spend six days unloading the cargo brought up by the Dragon and replacing it with items to take back to Earth. The Dragon is to undock on Thursday and parachute into the Pacific Ocean off California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launched the Dragon capsule on top of its Falcon 9 rocket on Tuesday. The company and NASA spent several days conducting tests to check the Dragon's operations. On Thursday, it flew 1.5 miles beneath the station to test its communication and navigation systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It passed those tests, then looped around the space station to begin its final approach. By design, the approach was slow, with built-in pauses. As part of the testing process, the crew sent commands to the capsule to stop or temporarily move away, ensuring that Dragon could be safely sent off if something went badly awry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> did run into some difficulties with Dragon's navigation sensors, one that took thermal images and one that bounced laser pulses, and that delayed the capture by a couple of hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is, I think, going to be recognized as a significantly historical step forward in space travel,'' <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief executive, Elon Musk, said during a news conference. ''Hopefully the first of many to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk's dreams are far grander than delivering cargo to the space station. Although he would like to carry astronauts to the station in a few years, that would still be merely retracing accomplishments that the American and Russian space programs achieved decades ago. ''It's evolutionary, not revolutionary,'' Mr. Musk agreed in an interview last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To accomplish Mr. Musk's very long-term goal -- sending people to Mars, which he regards as essential for ensuring the survival of humanity -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> must create new technologies that fundamentally change the current equation of space travel, in which most of the vehicle is thrown away each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk talks of reusable rockets, but his first attempt to accomplish that -- recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 via parachute -- failed. Twice, in 2010, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> tried this method, but each time the rocket stage disintegrated as it fell. On this flight, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> gave up trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new idea is for the engines to fire again after they drop off, and the rocket stages would fly back to land to be refueled. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> plans to begin tests of this vertical takeoff and landing concept, dubbed Grasshopper, this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk also talks of building a giant rocket powered by next-generation engines using new fuels, bigger than the Falcon Heavy rocket he is hoping to launch within the next two years. ''It's going to be very big,'' he said. ''Very huge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigger than the Saturn V that launched NASA astronauts to the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Could be,'' he said with a smile. He said he would provide more details later this year or in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has also consistently underestimated the time it would take to accomplish its tasks. In 2006, when NASA selected it to develop the cargo ship, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said the first trip to the station would take three years; it took six. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also has a large backlog of commercial satellites it is under contract to launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This track record may be relevant to Mr. Musk's stated goal: he said he thought <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> could send people to Mars in 15 years -- 20 years at most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that prediction, he said he hoped he was not off by a factor of two. ''I'll be 80,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday morning the cargo capsule built by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a private company, may (or may not) have docked with the International Space Station. After Tuesday's launch of the Falcon 9, the rocket carrying the capsule, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief executive, Elon Musk, said at a news conference, ''We're really at the dawn of a new era of space exploration and one where there's a much bigger role for commercial companies.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, another private company, one operated by the artist Tom Sachs, is gearing up for an imaginary manned expedition to Mars. Preparations for that voyage, including all the equipment Mr. Sachs and his team will need, are on display in ''Space Program: Mars,'' an exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory that is expansive and diverting but not as imaginative or conceptually provocative or as much fun it ought to be. It is produced and curated by the Armory and Creative Time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs is not a rocket scientist but a sculptor who creates rough copies of technologically complicated objects out of plywood, foam core, tape, glue, nuts and bolts and other materials -- including real objects like propane torches, hand tools, boomboxes and thermoses -- readily available from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and other vendors. A memorable example was a life-size airplane lavatory that he made in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most impressive piece here is the ''Landing Excursion Module,'' a version of the Apollo Lunar Module that carried astronauts to the surface of the Moon. Over 23 feet tall with antennas and dishes attached to its top, the boxy white structure stands on splayed, shock-absorbing steel legs with inverted-dome feet. Unlike the Apollo module, this one's body is made of plywood panels painted white and visibly held together by tape and glue. If you undergo the program's ''indoctrination'' -- see below -- you will be permitted to climb up a short aluminum ladder and into the cabin, which is also made of plywood. Here there is some exotic-looking equipment, like a bank of shiny yellow metal air bottles with connecting hoses, but it is not nearly as complex as you would expect a real extraterrestrial vehicle's interior to be. It is more like a fabulous backyard fort for kids built with basic parental construction skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distributed elsewhere about the Armory's 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall are a ''Mobile Quarantine Facility,'' which is a repurposed 1972 Winnebago Brave; a ''Mars Excursion Roving Vehicle,'' a bodiless, battery-powered car with all its parts exposed for exploring the Martian landscape; and ''Mission Control,'' where more than three-dozen computer screens display live feeds from cameras placed throughout the exhibition. Scattered about the floor as well are red, crystal-shaped mounds made of plywood, tape and glue, meant to suggest the surface of Mars. A red NASA logo appears on many objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entertainment factor is enhanced by an introductory lesson for those who choose to undergo it. First you must watch a series of amusing movies by Mr. Sachs in which basic, often nonsensical tenets and rules of his enterprise are explained in a deadpan delivery mimicking that of real training films. Next you go to the Indoctrination Center, where you are tested on what you have learned from the films. If you pass you will be permitted to enter the landing module and participate in the program as one of Mr. Sachs's crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show's entertainment is diminished, however, because the exhibits are mostly static. Few objects do more than sit there to be looked at, and observing the variously clunky, smart and dumb ways of representing high-tech equipment wears thin after a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it all means as art remains fuzzy. Nothing about the show convinces you that space exploration is a subject of great urgency. That is not to say that it cannot be. For much of the first half of the 20th century Mars was an object of considerable popular fascination largely because the possibility of intelligent life there had yet to be ruled out. More recently, however, as unmanned expeditions to that planet have revealed an insalubrious climate and barren landscape inhabited by microbes at best, Mars as a destination has faded from the collective imagination. Travel to other galaxies, sure, but Mars? Who wants to go there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs's project might be taken as Warholian social satire, a spoof of the modern corporate culture and its gung-ho work ethic, so at odds with artistic romanticism. That aspect is heightened in one of the Armory's smaller, separate rooms, where Mr. Sachs is selling space-camp-style sneakers, knapsacks and overcoats that he designed and that <span class="companylink">Nike</span> has issued in limited editions. (These are not cheap.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a critique of branding and commercialism animating his art, it seems equally likely that Mr. Sachs aspires to the kind of business model associated with Takashi Murakami, who has incorporated his own gift shop into his museum exhibitions to sell high-end handbags and cheap souvenirs. But Mr. Sachs has a way to go before he achieves such seamless vertical integration. And with the launch of Falcon 9, it appears he needs to do some catching up with events in real time and space too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will probably change if things keep going his way. Elon Musk, a computer prodigy and serial entrepreneur whose ambitions include solving the world's energy needs and colonizing the solar system, was the man of the hour -- or of 3:44 a.m. Tuesday, Eastern time -- when the rocket ship built by his company, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, lifted off gracefully in a nighttime launching and arced off in a streak of light amid loud applause.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Falcon flew perfectly!!'' Mr. Musk posted exultantly on Twitter from his iPhone at 4:04 a.m. ''Dragon in orbit, comm locked and solar arrays active!! Feels like a giant weight just came off my back :)''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, his unmanned Dragon capsule, lifted into orbit by his Falcon 9 rocket, will berth at the International Space Station on Friday bearing a modest cargo: 162 meal packets (45 of them low-sodium), a laptop computer, a change of clothes for the station astronauts and 15 student experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far more important than the supplies is the proof of concept. Mr. Musk is trying to show the world that a determined entrepreneur can start a rocket company from scratch and, a decade later, end up doing a job that has until now been the exclusive province of federal governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every launch into space is a thrilling event,'' John P. Holdren, President Obama's assistant for science and technology, said in a statement. ''But this one is especially exciting because it represents the potential of a new era in American spaceflight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest achievement by Mr. Musk, a cocky businessman who was born in South Africa and is one month shy of his 41st birthday. Best known for helping found <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and selling it to <span class="companylink">eBay</span> in 2002 for $1.5 billion, he currently multitasks by running two companies he founded: <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, officially known as the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, and <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, which in 2008 brought to market a head-turning all-electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster. He is also chairman of SolarCity, a company that designs and installs solar energy systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is based in Hawthorne, Calif., a few miles from Los Angeles International Airport, and Tesla is in Palo Alto in Northern California, but Mr. Musk runs both hands-on. He shuttles up and down the state, spending a few days a week at each. Early Saturday morning, he was in <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s mission control for the first launching attempt of the Falcon 9 when the computers called a last-second abort, shutting down engines that had already ignited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, he was crowing about a victory for Tesla's new all-electric sedan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Major Tesla milestone,'' he wrote on Twitter on Monday. ''All crash testing is complete for 5* (max) safety rating. Cars can now be built for sale to public!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Falcon 9 launched, putting Mr. Musk at the center of NASA's ambitious effort to turn over basic transportation to low-Earth orbit to private companies. On the same day, Tesla put out a news release announcing that customer deliveries of its electric sedan, the Model S, would begin on June 22 -- ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Model S ''represents Tesla's transition to a mass-production automaker and the most compelling car company of the 21st century,'' Mr. Musk is quoted as saying, sparing no modesty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(His characteristic confidence was also on view on Sunday night, when he told his 38,000 followers on Twitter that the abort on Saturday was actually overcautious: ''Simulations show launch ok with bad valve,'' he wrote. ''Still, better to stop &amp; fix. Recalling rockets after launch is not an option.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dragon is scheduled to stay at the station until the end of the month as astronauts unpack its cargo and replace it with items to bring back to Earth. Undocking on May 31, the Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off California. With the completion of a successful demonstration, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would begin a $1.6 billion contract to fly 12 cargo missions to the space station, and it hopes to be among the companies that NASA selects to take astronauts to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're really at the dawn of a new era of space exploration, and one where there's a much bigger role for commercial companies,'' Mr. Musk said at a news conference after the launching Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moment was also an inflection point in Mr. Musk's own career. After leaving South Africa for Canada at 17, he wound up at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in economics and physics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Mr. Musk went on to a graduate program in applied physics and materials science at Stanford. He stayed two days before dropping out to start Zip2, a company that developed Web sites for media companies; he and his brother sold it to Compaq in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk then founded X.com, which provided financial services and payment by e-mail. X.com merged with another company, Confinity, to form <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, and Mr. Musk built it into the primary means that <span class="companylink">eBay</span> bidders use to pay for their purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the sale of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, Mr. Musk looked for new things to do. By the standards of Internet tycoons, he was a pauper: after taxes, he had a fortune of about $170 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most Web entrepreneurs, however, he did not start more Internet companies. Instead he chose ventures involving complex technology and plowed almost all of his <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> fortune into them: $100 million into <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which he founded in 2002, $50 million into Tesla and $10 million into SolarCity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just four years ago, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> went through a near-death experience. The first three launchings of the company's small Falcon 1 rocket failed. One more failure, Mr. Musk said, and he would have run out of money. As he went through a divorce from his first wife, with whom he has five sons, he had to borrow money from friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth launching succeeded. Late in 2008, NASA awarded <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> the cargo contract. The first two Falcon 9 launchings, in 2010, also succeeded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Tuesday morning, the success streak continued. As the countdown clock hit zero, the engines remained ignited. Less than 10 minutes later, the Dragon was in orbit. It then aced several other early tasks like the deployment of solar arrays and navigational sensors and the testing of GPS equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything could have gone wrong,'' Mr. Musk said. ''And everything went right, fortunately.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When three American astronomers won the Nobel Prize in Physics last year, for discovering that the expansion of the universe was speeding up in defiance of cosmic gravity -- as if change fell out of your pockets onto the ceiling -- it reaffirmed dark energy, the glibly named culprit behind this behavior, as the great cosmic surprise and mystery of our time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it underscored the case, long urged by American astronomers, for a NASA mission to measure dark energy -- to determine, for example, whether the cosmos would expand forever or whether, perhaps, there might be something wrong with our understanding of gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2019, a spacecraft known as Euclid will begin such a mission to study dark energy. But it is being launched by the European Space Agency, not NASA, with American astronomers serving only as very junior partners, contributing $20 million and some infrared sensors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some scientists, this represents an ingenious solution, allowing American astronomers access to the kind of data they will not be able to obtain on their own until NASA can mount its own, more ambitious mission in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for others, it is a setback. It means that for at least the next decade, Americans will be relegated to a minor role in following up on their own discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While it's great to support other missions,'' said Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins and the Space Telescope Science Institute, who shared that Nobel last year, ''it would be disappointing to see the U.S. lose or outsource its own leading role in one of the hottest areas of research.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Riess and his colleagues, this turn of events is another example of a worrying trend in which American scientists, facing budget deficits and political gridlock, have had to pull back from or delay promising projects while teams based in Europe hunt down the long-sought Higgs boson or rocket scientists in China plan a Moon landing in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, called dark energy ''an example of how the U.S. seems to misplay its science hand these days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We predicted and discovered dark energy,'' he said. ''We have the biggest dark-energy community and the best ground game; we have been designing a space mission since 1998; and now the Europeans will fly it with our minor participation. Something is wrong with this picture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saul Perlmutter, of the University of California, Berkeley, another of the dark energy Nobel winners, said, ''The danger, of course, is that we will watch the science (and scientists -- and good students) move on to other countries and continents, where projects are being begun and completed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With them, scientists say, could go the cultural excitement and innovative spark that invigorates the economy. The World Wide Web, for example, was invented at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (home to the world's most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider), to help particle physicists communicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the United States' flagship lab for high-energy physics, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab, had to close down its accelerator. the Tevatron, last fall, and learned from the Energy Department in March that the agency could not afford to follow through for now on a $1.3 billion underground experiment to study the spooky shape-shifting properties of particles known as neutrinos in an effort to investigate why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the department also canceled money for studies for the world's next big physics machine, the International Linear Collider, which would be the successor to CERN's giant collider. American scientists are resigned to the likelihood that it will not be built in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American physicists are now rethinking how to carry out the neutrino experiment, which was to have been the centerpiece of a plan to convert the old 8,000-foot-deep Homestake gold mine in Lead, S.D., into a national laboratory for underground science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar facilities in Italy, Canada and Japan have become centers in the search for dark matter, neutrino experiments and other delicate work that requires shelter from cosmic rays. But in 2010, the National Science Foundation walked away from the $875 million project, citing unease about safety and ''stewardship'' of the old mine, which is half full of water. Meanwhile with support from a philanthropist, T. Denny Sanford, the State of South Dakota has reopened parts of the mine for a pair of physics experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is no achievement of modern American science -- from the Manhattan Project to the Hubble Space Telescope to the decoding of the human genome -- that does not owe a debt to hard and even heroic bargaining in the formerly smoke-filled rooms of Congress and the White House. Complaints and grim prognostications about the federal research budget are part of the background music of science. The situation is always fluid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given all that, other scientists say that basic research is doing as well as can be expected given severe budgetary restraints. Among other things,NASA's Webb telescope, the successor to the Hubble, is on target for launching in 2018, at a cost of $8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science office in the Energy Department actually got an increase in the budget released by President Obama in February, but the money went to more applied research, into areas like energy and scientific computing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only last month, Congress added money to the neutrino experiment, although not enough to get the whole project back on track, said Katie Yurkewicz, Fermilab's spokeswoman, and the Association of American Universities issued a statement applauding appropriators ''for their bipartisan actions thus far to sustain the nation's investment in scientific research.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Elmegreen, a professor of astronomy at Vassar and president of the American Astronomical Society, has spent a lot of time in Washington lately. ''Congress seems supportive of science,'' she said. ''I'm encouraged that people recognize the need for science and technology to continue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: ''U.S. leadership is at risk in practically every area. We'll get by for now, but we can't be complacent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, all bets could be off if the automated budget cuts, called ''sequestration,'' decreed by the failure of the deficit reduction negotiations last summer, go into effect in January. A certain amount of gloom has reached the most prestigious levels of American science. Writing in a recent issue of The New York Review of Books, Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate at the University of Texas in Austin, decried the fact that science was increasingly having to compete with other worthy causes, like health care and education, for money. The solution, he said, was to raise taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, described himself as ''less gloomy'' than Dr. Weinberg, but nonetheless concerned that, with the end of the cold war and bad economic times, the traditional political bases of government support for basic research had dwindled, leaving only ''curiosity and desire to participate, even indirectly, in doing something great.'' He added, ''We should be doing that anyway, of course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is all a great pity, because tremendous scientific opportunities are available,'' Dr. Wilczek said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States gave up its leadership in high-energy particle physics 20 years ago, when Congress canceled the Superconducting Super Collider, a particle accelerator that was under construction in Texas. That move cleared the way for CERN's eventual supremacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the same thing happen in space? Those fears were aroused two years ago when NASA announced that the James Webb Space Telescope project needed $1.6 billion more and several years to complete. It was canceled by the House Appropriations Committee last summer but later restored. The price of that rescue, however, was to delay NASA's dark energy mission, and to withdraw from a couple of upcoming joint Mars missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travails of the dark energy researchers provide a window into the labyrinthine process by which big projects live or die. Whether you find the story hopeful or depressing depends on who you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark energy is, according to Dr. Wilczek, ''the most mysterious fact in all of physical science, the fact with the greatest potential to rock the foundations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery that the expansion of the cosmos was speeding up came from observing exploding stars known as Type 1A supernovas, luminous and uniform enough to serve as distance markers. Realizing that only a telescope in space could find and measure supernovas distant enough to shed light, so to speak, on the genesis of this behavior, Dr. Perlmutter early on urged the construction of a special space probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, after a decade of wrangling among astronomers and NASA and the Energy Department, a blue-ribbon panel from the National Academy of Sciences charged with determining astronomical priorities endorsed a version of this idea as the highest-priority space science mission for the coming decade. The billion-dollar mission, called Wfirst, for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, would search for exoplanets as well as measure the effects of dark energy on the history and evolution of the universe. The academy's deliberations were ambushed, however, by the subsequent announcement of the Webb telescope's problems, which have pushed the Webb launch all the way to 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lia LaPiana, a program executive at NASA, said that, from 2013 to 2018, there is ''zero money'' in the president's budget for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a down payment on an eventual mission, NASA suggested spending about $200 million for a 20 percent stake in Euclid, the European Space Agency's mission. The academy rejected that idea, saying that Euclid, which would not measure supernovas at all, did not meet the academy's requirements and could undermine the possibility of an eventual Wfirst project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however, a specially convened committee of the academy has given the nod to a $20 million investment in Euclid in the form of equipment, saying it would give American astronomers a seat on the Euclid science team and access to its data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What changed in the last year? David Spergel, an astrophysicist at Princeton, who was chairman of the committee, said, ''For 20 percent, we were offered a modest participation. For 2 percent, we were offered a modest participation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Schechter of M.I.T., co-chairman of a team planning Wfirst, said he had endorsed the deal on the grounds that it would not impinge on the Wfirst project. When the president's budget was released, however, there was $9 million for Euclid and no money for beginning the Wfirst project. The budget is only the first step in this dance, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Dr. Schechter told a House appropriations subcommittee that the budget did not represent the ''strong U.S. commitment'' to Wfirst that the academy had recommended. He asked for $8 million to get things going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House panel agreed and responded in its report by directing NASA to explain how its plans were consistent with the academy's recommendations. In the meantime, the corresponding Senate appropriations subcommittee has put $10 million for the NASA dark energy mission into its proposed budget report, citing last year's physics Nobelists by name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more dance moves to make in this year's budget and the rest of the decade before the Wfirst mission can become a reality, but Dr. Schechter said he felt encouraged. ''I suspect Wfirst wasn't very high on anyone's list of priorities,'' he said, referring to turmoil at NASA last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''I think that is changing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 23, 2012, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the challenges facing physics research in the United States described incorrectly an experiment to study particles known as neutrinos.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket's nine engines had ignited, but computers detected a high pressure in the chamber of the center engine and shut them down The rocket is held down during the final engine checks and never left the launching pad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the capsule, the Dragon, reaches the space station, it will be first commercial spacecraft to dock there. All previous vehicles, like NASA's space shuttles and Russia's Soyuz capsules, were government operated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the evening, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> officials said they had identified a faulty valve as the problem and said the next launching attempt would be on Tuesday at 3:44 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight will be a second test in a $396 million program by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to develop the cargo ship. If successful, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will then enter a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo flights to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> flight is carrying 1,000 pounds of nonessential cargo, mostly food and clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA signed the development agreement with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> in 2006 as part of an effort to encourage new commercial space ventures and to reduce launching costs for the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second company with a NASA cargo contract, the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., hopes to get its first test flight off the ground in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency now also wants to turn to commercial companies for the launching of its astronauts. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hopes an upgraded Dragon will capture at least some of that business. After the retirement of the space shuttles last year, NASA astronauts currently must ride on Russian Soyuz rockets to get into space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, how quickly does grape juice turn to wine?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two California high school students hope to find out soon. Their experiment is one of 15 aboard a rocket scheduled to blast off early Saturday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., to the International Space Station. ''We think it's going to ferment faster,'' said Max Holden, a ninth grader at Chaminade College Preparatory in West Hills, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no guarantee that the seven-inch tube of yeast and grape juice will ever reach its destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching is a test flight of a spacecraft built by the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif. The event is slightly historic: if all goes well, the ship will be the first operated by a private company, rather than the government, to supply the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erring on the side of caution, officials at NASA and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> have stressed that the purpose of the mission is to shake out glitches. ''I think there's a significant chance the mission does not succeed,'' said Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, a Falcon 9 rocket with a Dragon capsule on top of it, will carry more than 1,000 pounds of cargo, mostly food and clothing -- items that NASA regards as no big loss should the launching fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only scientific experiments on the mission are those devised by students as part of a program run by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education. They will explore the effects of zero gravity, including whether medicines can slow bone loss and whether certain bacteria that eat plastic would thrive and eat greater amounts of plastic in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liftoff, set for 4:55 Saturday morning, is timed to take place at the moment the launching pad lines up with the space station's orbit. If weather or a technical problem keeps the rocket on the ground, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will have to wait until 3:44 a.m. Tuesday for the pad and orbit to line up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reaching orbit, the Dragon capsule is to perform a series of test maneuvers. On the third day, it is scheduled to fly 1.5 miles under the space station to demonstrate its navigation and communication systems. If it passes the tests, NASA will give the go-ahead for the final approach on Tuesday, when Donald R. Pettit, a NASA astronaut, will use the space station's robotic arm to grab the Dragon and pull it to a docking port.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If successful, the Dragon would be the first commercial spacecraft to visit the space station, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would collect the remaining payments on a $396 million agreement with NASA to develop the cargo ship. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would then enter a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo flights to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the flight fails, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would have to repeat the demonstration flight until it succeeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has so far avoided the early failures that typically accompany a new rocket like the Falcon 9. The maiden flight, in June 2010, was almost flawless. The second flight -- the first under the NASA agreement -- was in December 2010, putting into orbit a Dragon capsule that successfully parachuted back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successes have, however, taken longer than anticipated. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> originally predicted its first visit to the space station would be in 2009. The delays were not a big surprise, Mr. Musk said, given the complexities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, we would have hoped to have been further ahead,'' he said, ''but I wouldn't have expected that with great confidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the students at Chaminade Preparatory looking forward to the winemaking experiment, the launching will be particularly exciting. If the capsule makes it to the space station, one of the astronauts there will mix the grape juice and yeast and let it ferment for five days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Max Holden and his lab partner, Paige D'Andrea, a 10th grader, will perform the same experiment, and when the space wine is returned to Earth about a month later, they will compare the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we get it back, we're going to get one of the priests to bless it,'' said Nancy McIntyre, the director of the project for Chaminade, a Catholic school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To figure out which one is more alcoholic, the students will not taste any of the fermented grape juice, but instead will measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced by the yeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 23, 2012, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the items being carried to the International Space Station in a privately built spacecraft misstated the number of student experiments that the cargo includes. There are 15 student experiments aboard the flight, not 11.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like a routine event for NASA: At 4:55 a.m. on Saturday, a rocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and carry cargo -- but no people -- to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if all goes as planned, that morning will mark something transformative for the space industry: a victory for capitalism in what has been for decades a government-run enterprise. The capsule, built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short -- would be the first commercial spacecraft to make it to the space station, and many observers view its launching as the starting gun in an entrepreneurial race to turn space travel into a profit-making business in which NASA is not necessarily the biggest customer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, there are some hints of how the era of commercial space travel might unfold. Companies like Virgin Galactic, XCOR and Space Adventures are booking passengers on suborbital joy rides to space, promised for dates within the next few years, and hundreds of people are signing up. And already there are celebrity tie-ins: Among the people who have signed up for Virgin's first flights are Ashton Kutcher, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Katy Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more mundane note, the launching of commercial satellites has been a steady business for decades, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is among the companies already competing for contracts. Indeed, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> already seems to have built a viable business here, having announced more than $1 billion of contracts in the last few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the longer-term dreams, which may sound less far-fetched as each landmark in space travel grows nearer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think humanity needs to get to Mars, one way or another,'' said Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, who vows that his company will send people to Mars in as little as 10 years -- more likely 15 years, and certainly within 20. He said he would do this with or without NASA: ''I would prefer it would be with NASA. If not, we have to find another path.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station is only a couple of hundred miles up -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s rocket has yet to get there, of course -- and Mars is millions of miles away. But Mr. Musk predicts that travel to Mars will eventually become commonplace, and that the ticket price will eventually -- perhaps a decade after the first flight -- drop to half a million dollars. That contrasts with the more than $60 million a seat that the Russians are currently charging NASA to take one astronaut to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is it possible to achieve that?'' Mr. Musk said in an interview at his headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. ''I think it is. My calculations show that it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, space travel has been expensive and, as a government-managed operation, has had little incentive to streamline. NASA, of course, was the only game in town for American astronauts, and most recently it operated the shuttles that supplied the International Space Station. Big aerospace has been involved, too: One company, <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture between <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, effectively has a monopoly for launching satellites for NASA and the Air Force on its Delta IV and Atlas V rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only recently have smaller, nimbler companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, some of them run by billionaires who proved themselves in other fields, started trying to compete as equals with NASA and its major contractors. (Mr. Musk, for example, is an Internet entrepreneur who founded <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is attempting to build the same class of vehicle, to my mind, only with modern manufacturing techniques and management techniques to reduce the cost,'' said Jeff Greason, chief executive of XCOR Aerospace, which is building a two-seat rocket plane to take tourists to the edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the end of the space shuttle program, NASA has relied on Russia to take its astronauts to space in Soyuz rockets, but now it is looking to hire commercial companies for space taxi services. So there are incentives for commercial companies both to build the transportation and to offer it at competitive prices. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for one, says that it could provide rides to NASA astronauts at $20 million a seat, a third of the Russian price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new space companies are relying on taxpayer dollars to finance their research and development. The Obama administration requested $830 million for next year to finance the development of passenger-carrying spacecraft. Proponents argue that the investments will jump-start a vibrant new business that dwarfs NASA; Congress has so far remained skeptical. A report by the House committee in charge of NASA's budget said the program ran the ''risk of repeating the government's experience from last year's bankruptcy of the solar energy firm <span class="companylink">Solyndra</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the ambivalence on Capitol Hill, the new space competition has drawn both entrepreneurs and the old aerospace giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, better known as ATK, manufactured the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttles and had the contract to build a longer-range version as the first stage for NASA's next-generation rocket, the Ares I. That was before the Ares I was canceled in favor of the space taxi approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK has now teamed up with Astrium, a European rocket company, to come up with what is essentially a commercial version of the Ares I, which it called the Liberty. Last week, ATK announced that it was developing its own capsule -- based heavily on the Orion capsule that was originally going to sit on top of the Ares I -- to carry astronauts for NASA one day. ATK says it, too, would charge less than the Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is not clear is whether there are people and companies interested in buying all those seats to orbit. Currently, the market for taking people into space is small. NASA needs to send only two crews a year to the space station, and if a piece of space debris were to disable the station, there would suddenly be no demand at all. The commercial future of space, while relying on NASA financing in the short run, needs new markets for manufacturers to take advantage of the economies of mass production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only way to make a dramatic reduction of price is to assume a dramatic increase of launches,'' said Mr. Greason of XCOR. ''You have to assume there is some market, that there will be enough demand to support that low price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current rockets -- most of them good for one launching only -- are very expensive regardless of whether they are built by entrepreneurs or government. The future of low-cost travel in space hinges on reusable rockets and technologies not yet developed, space experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk declined to talk about what a profitable business model for sending people to Mars might look like, but said his ultimate goal of a $500,000 trip to Mars depended on a large number of passengers and fully reusable systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not going to try to convince people I can do it,'' he said. ''I'm just going to do it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF you wanted to find a good place in Manhattan from which to plan a manned mission to Mars, the studio of the artist Tom Sachs might not be the first place you would look.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a stretch of Centre Street at the edge of SoHo that has achieved the antique polish of so many fashionable downtown blocks, the storefront studio stands out as a holdover from the neighborhood's pre-money past. The main entrance is barricaded by a rusted metal cage and gate, behind which there is a beaten-up buzzer and a hand-scrawled sign that says, unhelpfully, ''Brancusi.'' If you didn't know an artist and his assistants worked there, you could easily mistake the interior -- encrusted with power tools and cubbyholes and bad fluorescent light fixtures -- for a wholesale hardware supplier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a recent visit Mr. Sachs and his studio manager attempted to show off a scale model of the Saturn rocket that launched a generation of men to the Moon. But just as a demonstration was about to get under way to create a smoky, realistic-looking liftoff on a small video screen, power to the model went kaput. A space heater wired up in an old Winnebago parked out front had tripped a circuit breaker in the studio. ''That's crazy,'' Mr. Sachs said, staring ahead in disappointment. ''We've got to get it on a dedicated circuit. That should not happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again the trip to Mars he has been planning obsessively for several years is not really the kind where an equipment failure would spell catastrophe, unless you concur with the artist Bruce Nauman's dictum that art is a matter of life and death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Mars mission will go only as far up as the Upper East Side. The air its astronauts breathe will be of a late springtime New York City composition. The landing module from which they emerge will be made mostly from three-quarter-inch plywood and screws. And the surface their motorized rover explores will consist not of rocky red soil but of the flat century-old pine boards that form the immense drill floor of the Park Avenue Armory at East 66th Street, where for a month beginning Wednesday Mr. Sachs will become the latest artist to take on the daunting space. Since the Armory's transformation in 2006 into one of the largest contemporary-art exhibition spaces in the country, artists have approached the drill floor's 55,000 square feet with widely varied modes of assault. It has been draped with Lycra tulle (Ernesto Neto), ''painted'' with the aid of peeling-out motorcycles (Aaron Young), filled with 30 tons of discarded clothing (Christian Boltanski) and turned into an oddly didactic Renaissance painting classroom by the director Peter Greenaway, whose installation looked lost in the setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs will likewise use the floor to display all manner of objects, some quite realistic -- the rover, the lander (a life-size model of the real Apollo lunar lander), a mission control center, a mobile quarantine unit (the aforementioned 1972 Winnebago) -- and many others that would never make a NASA manifest but that sound like pretty good things to pack for a very long interplanetary trip, like a hot-nuts machine, an old-school JVC boombox outfitted with solar panels and a beer fridge shaped like Darth Vader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his larger intention is to transform the drill hall into a theater for an extended piece of performance art, one that mines the United States space program for an entire prefabricated aesthetic -- script, choreography, costumes, sets -- and also for a complex load of cultural baggage about what fuels the compulsion to explore outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs, 45, has long had a reputation in the art world as a kind of high-comic tinkerer and provocateur who remakes industrial and consumer objects in an abject wood-shop fashion, as if to reclaim the mass-produced world for humanity or at least reopen humanity's eyes to the things that increasingly make up its visual landscape. He has carried this objective to sometimes sensationalistic lengths. In 1999 the dealer Mary Boone was arrested after a Sachs show featuring handmade shotguns and an Alvar Aalto vase full of real bullets for people to take home. At the Jewish Museum in 2002 he exhibited a scale model of a German concentration camp made from a Prada hatbox, an equation of fashion and fascism whose ''irony, if that's what it was,'' Michael Kimmelman wrote in The New York Times, was lost on the Holocaust survivors who wrote him in angry disbelief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs's DIY aesthetic has always straddled the line between art and science project, and the critical knock on him has often been that he labors perhaps a little too much to satisfy his own material fetishes. With ''Space Program: Mars'' the risk is that the project will be seen less as an art installation than as a monumental space-nerd amusement park, a view that Mr. Sachs said would greatly underestimate his ambitions. ''I always feel that people really misunderstand my vision, especially when it comes to NASA,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His fascination with the space program goes back many years -- he staged a mission to the Moon at Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles in 2007 -- but it did not grow out of boyhood astronaut fantasies. It grew instead out of his conviction that the Apollo program, one of the crowning technological achievements of the 20th century, was in itself mostly a work of performance art, one that spoke volumes about America's aspirations and fears. Relative to their immense cost the Moon shots produced little of practical value, their real goal being cold-war cultural and political spectacle, which placed them, Mr. Sachs said, firmly in the realm ''of the useless and spiritual, just like art.''He saw it all as a perfect kind of ready-made. And like many artists of his post-post-Duchampian generation he set out to remake it in his own style, not casually but by adopting all the discipline and can-do spirit that President John F. Kennedy summoned in his famous 1962 Moon speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a complete perfectionist, as you can see, in my own filthy way,'' said Mr. Sachs one morning in early spring in his studio, where many members of his 15-member crew were hard at work on elements of the Mars mission, which has been commissioned by the armory and the public art organization Creative Time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like to say that unlike the military, where you have to build something to such an exacting degree that it works every time and doesn't kill someone, we have to build it so that it will work at least once,'' he said. ''But that's still very hard to do, and we're very serious about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He even sought the advice of real space scientists, befriending engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena, Calif., two of whom came to New York to visit his studio in 2010 and have acted as unofficial advisers ever since. ''It was going to be just a lunch meeting,'' said Adam Steltzner, one of the engineers, ''and it actually ended at 3:30 or 4 in the morning the next day. It was kind of unbelievable. It was a very high-level interaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steltzner, who is in the midst of his own Mars mission -- he oversees entry, descent and landing for the $2.5 billion NASA project that will try to deposit the Curiosity rover on the planet in August -- said the chemistry in the studio was partly personal (there is rarely a dull moment around Mr. Sachs) but also a result of the engineers' appreciation of the degree to which artists can engage in intellectual, conceptual play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We actually experience some small, short periods of that in our work here,'' he said in a phone interview. ''But that's maybe four hours in three years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, after Mr. Sachs appealed to the engineers for badly needed help transforming an E-Z-Go golf cart into a working, realistic-looking Mars rover (complete with a joystick to replace the terrestrial-looking steering wheel), the project ended up being heavy on the play: in Mr. Sachs's telling, ''a really fun night of drinking and welding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If scientists yearn for the freedom of artists, however, Mr. Sachs's studio operates as a place where artists -- or at least the artist in chief -- yearn for the rigors of science. Upon entering, every visitor is photographed with a large handmade camera fashioned mostly from plywood and issued an official-looking identification sticker. The walls are covered with labels and handwritten lists. And anyone doubting the importance of these lists is directed to an instructional video called ''Ten Bullets,'' which Mr. Sachs and a former assistant, Van Neistat, made in 2010 to explain the studio's philosophy. Among the precepts: ''Creativity is the enemy;'' ''Inventions and developments must happen within the existing vocabulary -- don't jump ahead; stick to what has been defined for you to do''; ''Proper knowledge of the code is the first step in working to code''; and ''Follow this guide carefully and you probably won't be fired.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sachs said he made the video mostly so he wouldn't have to explain the basics to new interns. But while its management-seminar deadpan is extremely funny, the message is utterly serious, and the video has taken on a strange life of its own as a training tool. (A <span class="companylink">Young &amp; Rubicam</span> executive recently praised the video on his blog as ''impactful.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video and code are knit deeply into the entire project. And over the course of the exhibition the public -- or ''civilian witnesses'' -- will get to see a fair amount of the results of the studio's ''Right Stuff'' training and preparation. The more adventurous will even get to participate, earning rewards, like a visit to the landing module, by helping out with menial mission tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the majority of the performance involved in the project has happened over the last few months for the benefit of no one, really, except Mr. Sachs and his crew, as if the exhibition is only a kind of public observance of much more extensive rites for a new secular religion. Every Friday morning, for example, in a borrowed room at the armory, they change into white shorts, white running shoes and white T-shirts with the maxim ''It will not fail because of me'' written on the back and do an hour of vigorous calisthenics and stretches, a routine the young studio assistants seem to embrace with mostly nonironic gusto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's almost like a cult,'' said Anne Pasternak, Creative Time's president and a curator of the show. ''It's not just about making objects. It's about involvement in an ongoing performance every minute of the day. And he's using that to ask a lot of very serious questions about human ideologies and the decisions we make about this planet and the future of our species.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course it is also highly entertaining for the self-appointed flight director of an intricately constructed fantasy world almost entirely of his own design, in which everyone suits up and plays along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting one morning in the rover, parked surreally in an old oak-paneled storage room at the armory awaiting its mission, Mr. Sachs said, ''There's a very fine line between having great knowledge of all these scientific and technological and industrial cultures and actually becoming a part of them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether he still knows the location of that line may be an open question. ''We're really going to Mars,'' he said with a smile radiating Chuck Yeager confidence. ''I mean, we're doing it here at the armory, but except for the setting, we're really going.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmed: Vesta, the second largest of the asteroids, is a runt planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observations by NASA's Dawn spacecraft show that Vesta formed within the first few million years of the solar system, that its surface is in places as bright as snow and in others as dark as coal, and that it contains an iron core that may have even briefly generated a magnetic field -- all very planetlike features.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Vesta and Ceres, the largest asteroid and the Dawn's next destination, are also heavy enough that gravity has made them round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Dawn team finds itself calling these things planets all the time,'' Christopher T. Russell, the mission's principal investigator, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current parlance of astronomers, however, Vesta and Ceres, like Pluto, are dwarf planets, not planets. The definition of planet, set by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, not only takes into account size and appearance, but also requires that a planet be the gravitational bully in its orbit. While Vesta and Ceres are round, they have not vacuumed up or pushed away thousands of other rocks in similar orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is in large part what makes Vesta intriguing. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter seems to be the remnants of a planet that never came together, and a closer look at Vesta could reveal much about the planet-building process. Dust coalesced into larger chunks like Vesta, which is 330 miles wide, and these then combined to form the rocky planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, what scientists have learned from the Dawn fits with what they thought. ''Science doesn't have to go back to the drawing board right now,'' Dr. Russell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists report their Vesta findings in six articles in Friday's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the surprises is that two giant craters near the south pole of Vesta formed relatively recently: one of them a billion years ago, the other at least two billion years ago. On other solar system bodies like the Moon, such giant impacts occurred very early in the history of the solar system, about four billion years ago. The mineralogical measurements also confirm that a class of meteorites that have been found on Earth came from Vesta, very likely ejected by the impact that created the giant craters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vesta's pockmarked surface could also help tell why the pieces of the asteroid belt never became a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Vesta formed, the gravity of newly formed Jupiter stopped further growth. The traditional view is that Jupiter's pull accelerated the Vesta-size asteroids so that they smashed themselves apart instead of gently coming together. Jupiter would have scattered away many of the original asteroids, but slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alternate idea, however, is that Jupiter, nudged by leftover gas and dust in the early solar system, migrated inward to where Mars orbits today, scattering away the asteroids, and later was pulled outward again by the gravity of Saturn, and in its wake pulled back some asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vesta is definitely super interesting for the work that we did,'' said Kelvin Walsh, a research scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., whose computer simulations indicated that this could explain the current asteroid belt and why Mars is small compared with Earth and Venus. He is not a member of the Dawn team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2,000 craters on Vesta cataloged by the Dawn scientists could tell the history of impacts, and if Dr. Walsh is right, there might be fewer than would be predicted by the traditional picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dawn spacecraft has been orbiting Vesta since last July. This August, it will propel itself away from Vesta and head toward Ceres, which is slightly farther out from the Sun, but of a much different makeup. While Vesta is all dense rock and metal, Ceres appears to contain large amounts of ice. That could help solve another open question of the solar system: Where did Earth's water come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might have come from Ceres-like bodies that formed farther out in the solar system and then were pulled in by a migrating Jupiter, Dr. Walsh said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOJAVE, Calif. -- The sign into town, slightly weathered, says ''Gateway to Space!''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond it lies the Mojave Air and Space Port, once a Marine auxiliary air station during World War II, now an incubator for the tinkerers and dreamers in the New Space movement. Adherents believe that the next phase of space exploration will be led by nimble, ambitious entrepreneurs -- a new generation of people like Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who helped create the electronics industry in a garage -- and that this is their moment to come together and make it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very similar to the Silicon Valley effect,'' said Stuart O. Witt, the chief executive of the space port for the past decade, explaining how half a dozen outer space start-ups came to cluster at Mojave, a small desert town about 90 miles north of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where the first private, piloted spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, launched in 2004. Virgin Galactic is now conducting flight tests of a larger version, called SpaceShipTwo, that will take tourists on jaunts 62 miles up, giving them a brief bout of weightlessness. Small start-ups here are also developing new rocket fuels and trying to transform a discarded second stage of a rocket into a prototype moon lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the headline event for this push of entrepreneurs will take place on the other side of the country, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., where the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, plans to launch cargo (but no people) to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, all spacecraft going to and from the station have been government-operated vehicles like NASA's space shuttles and Russian Soyuz capsules. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Dragon capsule, perched atop its Falcon 9 rocket, will be the first purely commercial supply ship -- albeit one paid for by NASA -- to make the trip. The launching, delayed several times, is now scheduled for May 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The melange of small aerospace companies at Mojave shows that the ambitions of the New Space movement go far beyond serving as a delivery service for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the companies are fronted by famous billionaires: Virgin Galactic is part of Richard Branson's empire, while Stratolaunch is the brainchild of Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. Stratolaunch is building two cavernous structures, a factory to build an airplane with the widest wingspan and a hangar to store it in. The airplane will be an airborne launching pad for a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the lesser-known start-ups with shallower pockets and grungier work spaces. Masten Space Systems is housed in a one-floor box dating to Mojave's World War II days. The workshop is essentially a large garage, with pieces of rockets sitting on the concrete floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masten's specialty is its software, which makes a rocket take off vertically, hover and then land softly on the launching pad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Masten, the founder, used to dabble in rockets while running a technology company in the Bay Area. After the company was sold to Cisco, he founded his rocket company and, three years ago, won $1 million in a NASA-sponsored competition to demonstrate precision flying similar to what would be needed for a future lunar lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a hobby anymore,'' said Joel Scotkin, Masten's chief executive. ''We're essentially self-sufficient in terms of revenue right now as we grow our business and customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture has attracted people like Nathan O'Konek. A lawyer by training, he was working in New York putting together finance deals and volunteering at the Intrepid Air and Space Museum to sate his fascination with space. On a visit to Mojave, he learned about Masten and chucked it all to move here, becoming the director of business operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just 15 or so employees -- the number changes with the flow of interns -- Mr. O'Konek is often out at the launching pad helping load liquid oxygen into a rocket. Masten engineers fly their reusable rockets and conduct engine tests several times a week. ''You're out there all the time,'' Mr. O'Konek said. ''I like what we're doing. It's exciting, but I also like to see the other companies out there pushing the envelope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even smaller is Firestar Technologies, which gets much of its money from federal research contracts. Its main product is an alternative fuel for the thrusters that spacecraft use to maneuver in space. The chemical currently used, hydrazine, is highly toxic, and Greg Mungas, Firestar's chief executive, has a less toxic kind that could be tested soon on the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mungas started Firestar while at the University of Colorado, Boulder, but in 2009 he moved the company to Mojave, where it fit in more easily, adding to the cacophony of sonic booms, explosions and rocket launches that are heard daily. ''There are very few experiments that you can't basically design and run'' in Mojave, he said. ''It's a very, very open environment for doing this kind of testing. It's great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mojave is also the home of Scaled Composites, started by Burt Rutan, an aerospace pioneer. It was he who designed the first plane to fly around the world without refueling: Voyager, which completed that trip in nine days in 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air and space port is in an area replete with aerospace history. Just to the south is Edwards Air Force Base, where the Voyager flight began and ended, and where many of the Air Force's early rocket planes flew, including Chuck Yeager's X-1, the first to break the sound barrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Rutan's company continued to thrive after the 1986 flight, the rest of Mojave languished. By the mid-1990s, the port was best known as a parking lot for mothballed jets that airlines could not afford to fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern history of Mojave as a space capital starts with a business failure: the Rotary Rocket Company. The founders of Rotary wanted to shake up the industry with a low-cost design that merged rocket propulsion with helicopter blades in a vehicle that could get all the way to orbit. A prototype of the vehicle, called the Roton, was built and got off the ground with three test hover flights -- but then the company ran out of money and went out of business in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Roton now sits in a small park at the port, a testament to the airfield's philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We actually take pride in giving people permission to fail,'' said Mr. Witt, the port's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rotary people did not go away, but instead founded new space companies. Jeff Greason, Rotary's propulsion chief, opened <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>, also at Mojave. The company is building a space plane called Lynx that, like SpaceShipTwo, is meant to take tourists on suborbital flights. The Lynx is smaller, with just two seats: one for the pilot, the other for the passenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">XCOR has almost run out of money a couple of times -- employees have gone without paychecks occasionally -- but says it is flush with cash right now because of an infusion of investments. Test flights of the Lynx could begin this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like everyone at the Mojave port, Mr. Greason is looking forward to the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> capsule launching, viewing it as just the latest step along the road. ''They have much to be proud of,'' he said of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, run by Elon Musk, an Internet entrepreneur. ''But I don't believe they have reached the point where they are independent of NASA for their continued research and development activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that matter, neither have most of the start-ups here. While they cheer on Mr. Musk's rocket, they hope the momentum they are building is larger than that flight's fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's ridiculous to condition the success or failure of the industry on any one launch,'' Mr. Greason said, but ''there is reason for optimism that in the next few years, one or more companies -- I certainly hope we're one of them -- will become profitable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 9, 2012, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about commercial aerospace ventures in Mojave, Calif., misstated the site of the uninterrupted round-the-world flight by the experimental airplane Voyager in 1986.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, a space shuttle landed in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not under its own power, though, because it never had any power of its own. The shuttle that arrived at Kennedy International Airport on Friday after swanning over the metropolitan area for about an hour was the Enterprise, which was the prototype for the shuttles that rocketed into space.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise rode on top of a 747 jet that took off from Dulles International Airport near Washington at 9:39 a.m. Less than an hour later, the paired aircraft glided over the harbor, past the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River as thousands of New Yorkers and tourists cheered and snapped pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gleaming in the sunlight, they circled the suburbs and made another pass by Manhattan, escorted by a T-38 Talon jet, before touching down at Kennedy Airport at 11:22 a.m. ''American aviation,'' one man marveled as he joined dozens of other amateur photographers trying to capture the moment from the end of Pier 84 on the West Side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the flight was the first for Enterprise in more than 25 years, the shuttle's next move might be trickier. Enterprise is ultimately bound for the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, which is housed on a retired aircraft carrier docked at Pier 86.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded the prototype to the Intrepid last year after ending the shuttle program and giving the three remaining orbiters to other museums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so sad,'' said Sabrina Hawkins, 27, a chemical engineer who watched the flyover with her friend, Charles Mason. ''It's nice they're giving it final respects, but we don't have a follow-on program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly a decade, Enterprise had been on display at a satellite location of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. The Smithsonian preferred to have a shuttle that flew in space, so NASA gave it the shuttle Discovery, making Enterprise available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though officials in Texas, Ohio and Washington protested that their states were more deserving of such a valuable artifact of the space program, Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of NASA, said he wanted the shuttles to go where they would get maximum exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at a ceremony to welcome the arrival of Enterprise, New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, summarized the situation. ''We won,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the officials of the Intrepid museum are scrambling to validate that decision. Unlike some other museums that had vied for shuttles, the Intrepid did not have a place to put one. Last week, workers cleared some room on the carrier's flight deck to accommodate the temporary shelter they plan to erect for the Enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That inflated structure, similar to the domes that enclose some tennis courts, is expected to cost about $3 million, on top of more than $9 million that the museum has to pay NASA for delivering Enterprise to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intrepid officials hope to recoup some of that money by selling tickets to the exhibition to see Enterprise up close. First, though, they must get the shuttle onto the ship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle is lifted - or demated, to use NASA's terminology - off the 747, it will stay at the airport until June 6, when museum officials plan to place it on a barge and tug it through Jamaica Bay and up the Hudson. A floating crane will then lift the shuttle onto the Intrepid's flight deck. It will sit there, with its black nose pointed toward New Jersey, for a few years while museum officials work on their ambitious plan to build an annex on land that would serve as the shuttle's permanent home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will be fortunate if city residents and visitors remain as eager to catch a glimpse of the Enterprise as those gathered along the West Side were on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the aircraft soared over the Statue of Liberty, affording the crowds in Battery Park a clear profile, one spectator from Brooklyn, Peter Vasiljev, turned master of ceremonies, announcing, ''Ladies and gentlemen, it's the shuttle Enterprise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the High Line park along the West Side, the various languages - French, Italian and others - heard before the plane came into view all melted into the universal reactions of ''ooh'' and ''aah'' as Enterprise flew by. After it passed from view, Julian Wu, a 67-year-old resident of Chelsea and self-proclaimed space nut, said wistfully, ''I expected to hear a sonic boom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, with duties calling, the gatherings dispersed. Torrey Taralli, 33, who works in digital marketing, packed his camera and began to make his way off the elevated High Line park to 18th Street. ''I've got to go,'' he said. ''Got to get back to work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several miles away at Kennedy, the controller guiding the flight onto the runway said to the NASA pilots, ''Welcome to New York, and thanks for the show.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it will be a platinum rush that finally opens up the final frontier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a new company called Planetary Resources Inc. will unveil its plans to mine asteroids that zip close by Earth, both to provide supplies for future interplanetary travelers and to bring back precious metals like platinum.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture may sound far-fetched -- perhaps along the lines of Newt Gingrich's campaign promise to colonize the moon -- but it has already attracted some big-name investors, including Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, as well as profitable technology development contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you believe that resources in space are critical towards a space-faring future, you will inevitably come to the result that the asteroids -- in fact, the near-Earth asteroids -- are the steppingstones to the rest of the solar system,'' Eric C. Anderson, one of the company's co-founders, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was quick to add that the company's business premise was not as impractical as it might sound. Because an asteroid is devoid of air and its gravitational pull is negligible, getting there is relatively easy. Unlike landing on the moon or Mars, a robotic mining spacecraft would not need parachutes or a large engine to fly up to and attach itself to a small asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are probably about 1,500 near-Earth asteroids that are energetically easier to reach than the surface of the moon,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the asteroids are icy -- up to 20 percent water -- and the water could be drawn out by melting the ice. The water could be taken to supply stopovers for future astronauts or broken down into breathable oxygen or propellant for spacecraft on interplanetary missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other asteroids are rocky and metallic. A throng of robotic mining spacecraft could grind up pieces of the asteroid and smelt it to capture precious metals within.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Platinum -- which is used for jewelry, electronics components and automobile catalytic converters -- fetches about $1,500 an ounce these days, so a single spacecraft would not have to bring back a lot of it for the enterprise to make money. More common metals like iron could perhaps be used as raw materials in space factories, churning out spacecraft and other structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson and Peter H. Diamandis, the other founder of Planetary Resources, are already in the space tourism business with a company called Space Adventures, which has arranged eight trips to the International Space Station. While that venture has been a ''reasonably good success story,'' Mr. Diamandis said, ''the realization, at least for us, was it wasn't on track to really drive humanity opening the space frontier at the level that we desire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three years ago, Mr. Diamandis recalled, he and Mr. Anderson asked the question, ''So what's next?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They set up Planetary Resources a couple of years ago, but have kept quiet about it until now. The president and chief engineer is Christopher A. Lewicki, who previously worked as a manager on Mars missions at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Based in Bellevue, Wash., the company employs about 25 engineers and has development contracts for technologies like laser communications that it believes it will need for prospecting and mining missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The company is cash flow positive, already,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the leaders of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, investors include Ross Perot Jr., chairman of Perot Systems; and Charles Simonyi, a former chief software architect for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and one of the space tourists who has visited the space station. Thomas D. Jones, a former NASA shuttle astronaut and James Cameron, the filmmaker and deep-sea explorer, are advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson declined to say exactly how much money the company has raised. ''It's plenty,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''The collective net worth of our investors is like $50 billion, and they know what they're getting into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to launch the first spacecraft -- a small telescope to find small nearby asteroids -- within the next two years. Next, the company would send out a batch of small explorers to visit some of them. Actual mining would begin after that, first targeting water and then platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From meteorites that have landed on Earth, scientists know that some asteroids have concentrations of platinum 20 times that of ore in a platinum mine on Earth. But the concentration of the platinum would still be tiny -- perhaps a few hundred atoms per million -- and the company would need to develop robotic technology to extract the element from the rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To do large, large-scale mining of asteroids, you're talking about decades,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility the company is considering is to nudge a small asteroid, perhaps one as long as a football field, into an orbit around Earth closer than the moon. Then Planetary Resources -- and possibly other companies -- could try out their ideas of how to set up a mining operation. ''As one of the many options of how we could start the resource development, that's certainly among them,'' said Mr. Lewicki, the company president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing on nearby asteroids for natural resources is actually a very old idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1926, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a Russian scientist who worked out many of the basic requirements of rockets and space travel, listed colonization of the asteroid belt as number 12 of 16 steps in his ''plan of space exploration.'' Other dreamers have come along more recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is actually the fifth or sixth company that has been invented for purpose of doing it,'' said John S. Lewis, a retired University of Arizona professor who wrote a 1997 book, ''Mining the Sky'' (Basic Books), that described much of what Planetary Resources is looking to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Rocket Company in the mid-1980s developed a rocket motor, but Dr. Lewis said George A. Koopman, one of that company's founders, told him the ultimate destination was the riches of the asteroids. When American went out of business in 1995, James Benson, one of its founders, started another company, SpaceDev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, Mr. Benson made promises similar to the ones Planetary Resources has. SpaceDev's Near Earth Asteroid Prospector was to rendezvous with an asteroid, conduct scientific observations and claim it as private property. It was never built. (While SpaceDev never got to orbit, the company, now part of <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corp</span>., did have a notable space achievement. Its motors powered the SpaceshipOne, the first privately financed manned flights to space and will also be used in Richard Branson's upcoming Virgin Galactic spacecraft.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lewis thinks that Planetary Resources has a better shot at getting to the asteroids -- he was involved with both American and SpaceDev and is also an adviser to Planetary Resources -- because unlike previous ventures, ''this one has the distinct advantage in that it has technical savvy and adequate capitalization to get started.''</p>

A NASA spokesman, Michael Curie, said the agency would aim for the next day, when better conditions are expected. Clear skies will also make it easier for the public to witness its arrival in New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, on Wednesday morning, three vintage warplanes were trussed up and hoisted over the port side of the ship for a barge ride up the Hudson River to a museum near Schenectady, N.Y. They had to go to make way for the new star attraction: Enterprise, the prototype for the space shuttles that is due to arrive in New York City next week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise, which the federal government awarded last year to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan, is not scheduled to reach the ship for several weeks, but its move began commanding attention on Tuesday when the shuttle Discovery rode on top of a 747 jet from Florida to Dulles International Airport outside Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery will displace Enterprise at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum near Dulles on Thursday. After posing Enterprise nose to nose with Discovery, a crew employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will lift the prototype onto the same, specially equipped 747 over the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the jet will ferry Enterprise to Kennedy International Airport on Monday morning, slowing along the way for a low-altitude tour of the Statue of Liberty and other New York landmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so for the first time, a space shuttle will land in the city. That is, if the weather cooperates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the sunbathed deck of Intrepid on Wednesday, much of the talk was about the forecast for untimely rain on Monday. ''We've had a month of great weather,'' said Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the museum president, as she apprehensively scanned the sky. If Monday is too inclement, NASA officials may decide to postpone Enterprise's final flight, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she spoke, workers guided a Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight, its black wings folded up to reveal the stars and stripes on their undersides, down to the pier below. The Skyknight, which did most of its fighting in the dark in the 1950s, took its place beside two foreign planes that were also being jettisoned: a British Royal Navy fighter-bomber known as a Supermarine Scimitar F1 and a Soviet-designed Mikoyan-Gurevich MIG-15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, the crane would move them onto an adjacent barge that resembled a floating Dumpster for the trip north to the Empire State Aerosciences Museum in Glenville, N.Y. Ms. Marenoff-Zausner said the decision to give up the planes was ''bittersweet'' because it would help Intrepid accommodate Enterprise, which the museum's directors hope will be a big draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With Enterprise coming, we had to make deck space,'' said Eric Boehm, the museum's curator of aviation and aircraft restoration. ''And the only way to make deck space was to move three airplanes off. It's hard to see them go, but it's for the greater good. We're going to get Enterprise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum will need to attract a big crowd to help offset the costs of transporting the shuttle from Dulles. The bill for the move, which the museum had to pay in advance, came to $9.6 million, said Matt Woods, the museum's senior vice president for facilities and engineering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Woods's staff must erect an all-weather tent, 56 feet tall, on the aft of the flight deck. They have begun reinforcing the steel deck to hold the Enterprise, which Mr. Woods says weighs about 75 tons. Already, a red outline of the shuttle's distinctive shape is painted there, the nose aimed at the commuter ferry terminal in Weehawken on the New Jersey side of the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get Enterprise there from the airport in Queens will be a trial of its own. First, the cranes and stabilizers being used at Dulles to take Discovery off the 747 and put Enterprise on it must be dismantled and trucked to Kennedy. In the meantime, Enterprise will remain mated to the jet in a tent at the airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, it will take about six weeks to get the shuttle off the plane and onto a barge. After a slow tug through Jamaica Bay, under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, through New York Harbor and up the Hudson to Pier 86, a floating crane with a 190-foot boom will hoist Enterprise onto the flight deck, Mr. Woods said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the shuttle is in place, Mr. Woods said, the tent -- similar to the bubbles that cover some tennis courts -- will be raised over it. By July, he said, the museum hopes to start selling tickets for entry into an exhibit designed around Enterprise that will cost about $3 million to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the serious fund-raising will begin. Later this year, Ms. Marenoff-Zausner said, Intrepid will start collecting donations toward a permanent structure, possibly a museum across the West Side Highway from the carrier with Enterprise as its centerpiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ultimately,'' she said, ''we want to be able to create a permanent home for it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That slim rocket was meant to launch the nation's first satellite into orbit. But starting in August 1957, four static firings of its engines failed. Pressure soared as Moscow successfully sent its first satellite into orbit that October.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporters descended on Cape Canaveral, Fla. On Dec. 6, the countdown reached zero, and Vanguard lifted off the launching pad. It rose four feet before settling back in a churning ball of smoke and fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vanguard satellite fell clear and ''came comfortably to rest nearby, chirping innocently,'' according to ''The Heavens and the Earth,'' a history of the early days of the American space program. Early the following year, the United States was able to launch a satellite with a different rocket, and less than three months later, finally managed a successful Vanguard launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the United States can learn from failure, maybe North Korea can, too. It needs to, after 14 years of failures in the development of rockets powerful enough to loft a satellite -- particularly when its secretive leadership encourages its impoverished people to indulge in grandiose expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews, aerospace experts said major setbacks are a normal part of rocket programs and can produce crucial information for engineers struggling to identify problems and make improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This stuff is really hard to do,'' David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wright noted that South Korea had twice recently failed to fire a satellite into orbit, first on Aug. 25, 2009, and then again on June 10, 2010. ''It's basically a very hard business,'' he observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, North Korea's failures have some experts scratching their heads. They note that Iran -- which has drawn on North Korean expertise to build its own families of small and large rockets -- is in many respects outdoing its instructor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tehran fired its first satellite into space in 2009, joining the elite club of nations that have used their own technologies to send objects into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wright suggested that North Korea might be having problems with quality control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their overall design seems to make sense,'' he said. ''But mundane sorts of things might get in the way, such as welding. Putting it all together can be hard.''</p>

Heads ache. Noses bleed. Dizziness overcomes the researchers toiling in the shadow of the Licancabur volcano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then there's what we call 'jelly legs,' '' said Diego Garcia-Appadoo, a Spanish astronomer studying galaxy formation. ''You feel shattered, as if you ran a marathon.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the same conditions that make the Atacama, Earth's driest desert, so inhospitable make it beguiling for astronomy. In northern Chile, it is far from big cities, with little light pollution. Its arid climate prevents radio signals from being absorbed by water droplets. The altitude, as high as the Himalaya base camps for climbers preparing to scale Mount Everest, places astronomers closer to the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opened last October, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, known as ALMA, will have spread 66 radio antennas near the spine of the Andes by the time it is completed next year. Drawing more than $1 billion in funding mainly from the United States, European countries and Japan, ALMA will help the oxygen-deprived scientists flocking to this region to study the origins of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project also strengthens Chile's position in the vanguard of astronomy. Observatories are already scattered throughout the Atacama, including the Cerro Paranal Observatory, where scientists discovered in 2010 the largest star observed to date, and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, which was founded in 1961 and endured Chile's tumult of revolution and counterrevolution in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ALMA opens a new stage for astronomy in Chile, which is favored by international research organizations for the stability of its economy and legal system. Like other radio telescopes, ALMA does not detect optical light but radio waves, allowing researchers to study parts of the universe that are dark, like the clouds of cold gas from which stars are formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With ALMA, astronomers hope to see where the first galaxies were formed, and perhaps even detect solar systems with the conditions to support life, like water-bearing planets. But the scientists here express caution about their chances of finding life elsewhere in the universe, explaining that such definitive proof is likely to remain elusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We won't be able to see life, but perhaps signatures of life,'' said Thijs de Graauw, a Dutch astronomer who is ALMA's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, scientists believe ALMA will make transformational leaps possible in the understanding of the universe, enabling a hunt for so-called cold gas tracers, the ashes of exploded stars from a time about a few hundred million years after the Big Bang that astronomers call ''cosmic dawn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALMA's construction, said Jesus Mosterin, a prominent Spanish philosopher who writes about the frontier between science and philosophy, and who visited the observatory last year, is taking place at ''the only time in history that windows into the universe are being thrown wide open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chile is not the only country luring big investments in astronomical projects. South Africa and Australia are competing to host an even bigger radio telescope, the Square Kilometer Array, which would be fully operational by 2024. China has begun building its own large radio telescope in a craterlike setting in the southern province of Guizhou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the financial crisis in rich industrialized countries has raised concerns that funding for some ambitious astronomy projects could face constraints. In the United States, a Congressional panel last year proposed killing NASA's James Webb Space Telescope before a compromise spending plan saved the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be very sad for humankind if we were so spiritually decadent to forgo the pleasures of consciousness and of knowledge,'' said Mr. Mosterin, reflecting on the funding choices political leaders need to make. ''These things make human beings a very interesting animal indeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALMA's Operations Support Facility, an outpost built for the scientists here in the Atacama, offers a glimpse into the lengths to which people go for astronomical discoveries. From Chajnantor, where dust devils dance across the plain, and unusually extreme weather in recent months has included rains and sand storms, a dirt road runs to the facility past towering cactuses and herds of wild donkeys and vicunas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The facility, at an altitude of about 9,500 feet, houses about 500 researchers and other staff in shipping containers turned living quarters. In a system similar to that on offshore oil platforms, scientists have daily shifts lasting up to 12 hours for 8 days straight. Many toil through the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Quiet Zone,'' reads one sign in an area of containers for ALMA's so-called day sleepers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supervisors enforce other rules, ensuring a work environment almost as austere as the surrounding Mars-esque landscape. Alcohol is prohibited, and those found drinking after trips into San Pedro de Atacama, a town about 30 minutes away by car, must dry out at a security checkpoint before entering the futuristic complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the control room, where astronomers spend hours peering into screens displaying the array of antennas, some gallows humor prevails. ''We are well in the control room, the 17,'' reads one message scribbled on a piece of roofing and posted on the wall after fire alarms went off by accident at the facility in 2011, sealing those inside the control room until they broke a door to escape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The note riffs on the 2010 mine accident and subsequent rescue of 33 miners in the Chilean desert, during which the trapped men sent a note to the surface saying, ''We are well in the shelter, the 33.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments elsewhere in Chile occasionally raise eyebrows here, like antigovernment protests that have rocked remote regions of the country this year and spread in March to the nearby mining city of Calama. ''The protests are not directly a concern,'' said Mr. de Graauw, ALMA's director. ''They are part of a democratic process, not a revolution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it seems at times that the astronomers stationed here are as far removed from the world around them as the miners working beneath other parts of the Atacama. English predominates as the observatory's language, tying together scientists from dozens of countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sense of awe still accompanies the installation of each new antenna. Two giant German-manufactured transporters, each with 28 tires and engines equivalent to two Formula 1 racing vehicles, are used to transport the antennas. Called Otto and Lore, they look like massive mechanized centipedes making their way across the arid landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a quietness that comes to you at Chajnantor,'' said Lutz Stenvers, a German engineer who came here in 2008 to lead a team from <span class="companylink">General Dynamics</span> building the antennas. ''I can see why this place was chosen.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEARLY 36 years ago, our understanding of life was changed forever when scientists towing a remote vehicle through the depths photographed a cluster of clams on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean far beyond the reach of sunlight, where no life was supposed to be. The clams were nourished by geothermal ocean vents instead of energy from the sun.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, scientists and explorers from around the world have quietly and patiently discovered a foreign universe full of life here on Earth. The latest foray was on Sunday, when the director James Cameron descended nearly seven miles into a trough known as the Challenger Deep, the planet's deepest known recess, off Guam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should honor this accomplishment and encourage continued exploration through a global effort by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to preserve the deep seas. The open ocean beyond regions of national jurisdiction covers roughly half of the planet's surface. We have no idea what strange life thrives in the blackness there at depths of two miles or more. That's the point. We know enough that we don't want to lose it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep-sea researchers live apart from the bright lights and billions of dollars devoted to space exploration. But these researchers, working in relative obscurity, nonetheless have documented rich and surprisingly diverse communities of organisms in the deep sea. These have been low-budget expeditions, mostly robotic, sponsored by a handful of countries with a little capital to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At ocean vents, hot gases emerge out of the ocean floor and support life that does not rely on photosynthesis and sunlight. In the 1980s, different life was discovered at cold methane seeps. These life forms use methane as their source of energy, not the sun or photosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the weirdness continues. Recently, my colleagues Lisa Levin and Greg Rouse of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography documented an ecosystem off Costa Rica that shows elements of both vent and seep life, where organisms that can tolerate extreme heat and extreme cold can rub elbows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin flew into space in the first manned space flight, more than a year after the bathyscaphe Trieste, a deep-sea submersible carrying Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, descended 35,797 feet into the Challenger Deep. They were the true mad men of the era: the Trieste could have been sent unmanned to this depth, but instead Mr. Walsh and Mr. Piccard accompanied it on its first attempt, not hitting the panic button even when a Plexiglas window cracked at about 29,000 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We thought back then that the era of deep sea and space exploration had begun. We were right about space. But it wasn't until four private expeditions were assembled recently that a return to the Challenger Deep was possible. Over the next 10 years, scientists hope to exploit the wonderful technology invented for these expeditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday Mr. Cameron, in a submarine of his own design, on an expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society, finally became the first human to return to the Challenger Deep in more than 52 years. We should continue this exploration. Much remains to be discovered. Indeed, as just one example, my colleagues hope to discover new creatures that produce novel molecules that, when tweaked and synthesized in the lab, will replenish our rapidly decreasing array of effective pharmaceuticals. Properly managed, noninvasive use of our oceans might keep us safe until we are smart enough to design drugs with just our brains and computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exploration of the ocean depths will happen just like the exploration of Mars. Robots will do most of the work, collect all the data, and if we are lucky and smart enough to occasionally take a pilot along, these expeditions will enrich the human condition more than we can imagine. Yes, exploration of the deep ocean will be just like the exploration of Mars -- with one huge exception. We already know we are going to find life in the deep ocean, and lots of it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon he, and the rest of the world, will find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mohamed's idea is one of the two global winners of Space Lab, a competition run by <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s video site; Lenovo, the computer manufacturer; and Space Adventures, a space tourism company. Students ages 14 to 18 from around the world were invited to make videos pitching a science experiment to be conducted on the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two 16-year-olds from Troy, Mich., Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma, formed the other winning team, with an experiment that will look at whether a fungus-killing bacterium will become even more effective at killing fungus when it gets back from a trip that will make it temporarily weightless. Scientists already know that salmonella bacteria become more virulent in zero gravity, and the bacterium in their experiment, Bacillus subtilis, contains the same protein that caused that change in salmonella.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea, that having your experiment in the space station, is so surreal and so literally out of this world,'' said Ms. Chen shortly after the winners were announced on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the zebra spiders, Mr. Mohamed does not think they will figure out how to catch fruit flies in space. These spiders do not spin webs, but they do attach a silk lifeline to themselves before leaping; this will allow them to reel themselves in and try again and again to aim themselves at fruit flies sharing their space station habitat.</p>

Sunita Williams, a NASA astronaut, is to perform the experiments, which will be broadcast online.</p>

While NASA expected the debris to pass by safely, the six astronauts -- Anton Shkaplerov, Anatoly Ivanishin and Oleg Kononenko of Russia; Donald R. Pettit and Daniel C. Burbank of the United States; and Andre Kuipers of the Netherlands -- were ordered into the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it could not determine the size of the debris. Even small amounts of debris, however, can pose a danger to the 450-ton space station; the space station and the satellite debris were traveling at speeds of 17,500 miles an hour, NASA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday's episode underscored a recent report by the National Research Council warning that the increasing amount of space debris is threatening to interfere with the space station and working satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit group warned that the growing amount of debris is threatening to make low-Earth orbit unusable because of the potential for collisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Space Surveillance Network is tracking more than 22,000 objects larger than 4 inches in size, NASA said, with about 1,000 being some form of spacecraft and the rest being classified as debris.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter directs the Center for SETI Research -- SETI is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence -- and the 42 antennas that sit outside her window are once again sampling radio emissions from a patch of sky that offers a window into one of the spiral arms of our galaxy. Shuttered for more than a year by budget problems, the array was turned back on in December to continue its search. Now, the searchers have another reason for optimism.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With new Web-based software called SETILive, an army of independent citizen-scientists are being enlisted to help with the hunt for unusual signals. The software, which can be found at setilive.org, was designed by Zooniverse, a team of programmers and scientists who have created Web-based systems to enable citizen participation in research in fields like astronomy and marine biology. SETILive was switched on late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two weeks, more than 40,000 volunteers have signed up, and more than one million radio samples have been analyzed. (Another Zooniverse project, Galaxy Zoo, has enabled more than 600,000 amateur astronomers to help with classifying an immense number of deep-sky objects since 2007.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the remarkable revelations of the Kepler satellite mission, the searchers have a target list. Kepler has revealed thousands of planets relatively close to our solar system. Now, rather than sweeping the entire sky, the array of 42 antennas, spread over the countryside in the mountain valley here in Northern California, dart electronically from target to target, capturing snippets of what the watchers hope might be evidence of alien life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter, a 68-year-old astronomer, said the use of volunteers was an experiment. She is hoping that the SETI researchers can use human pattern recognition to fine-tune software algorithms that in the past have been used to look for tantalizing signals hidden among fields of natural stellar radiation and human-made sources of interference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a single cellphone can raise havoc with the sensitive antennas, which are supercooled and can scan a huge swath of the radio spectrum, from 1 to 10 gigahertz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time that SETI has looked to human volunteers. Over the past decade, the organization has used the Internet to weave together a virtual supercomputer called SETI@Home, analyzing roughly 160 terabytes of radio data collected by the radio telescope at Arecibo, P.R. More than six million volunteers have run the SETI@Home software on their desktop computers, and that project is now being extended to take advantage of the new information produced by the Kepler mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With SETILive, the researchers are hoping to add the power of the human mind to the scanning efforts. Projects in other fields have already proved the power of relatively untrained human participants. For example, Foldit, a project of University of Washington biochemists and computer scientists, developed a Web-based video game that treated protein-folding as a puzzle. The researchers were able to demonstrate that the game's players, many of them high school students with little background in biology, could outperform the best protein-folding algorithms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have software that finds narrow-band signals much better than your eye can,'' Dr. Tarter said. ''Basically what we're doing with humans is to see how well they do. We are giving them marking tools and learning how they extract features.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, she said, a huge challenge for the SETI researchers has been that the researchers have had to contend with powerful interference sources at the sites of their radio observatories from both Earth-based radars and satellite communications. The Allen telescope site here in Hat Creek is relatively free from interference sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also, of course, the ''drunk under the streetlight'' effect. SETI researchers have devoted much of their resources to the electromagnetic spectrum from 1 to 10 gigahertz because it offers a relatively quiet window for observation from within the Earth's atmosphere. If there were an alien civilization orbiting a nearby star, no one is really certain how they would choose to communicate with us. Radio or television broadcasts are a possibility, but so are powerful pulsed lasers and conceivably communications that employ some advanced phenomenon like quantum entanglement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade, because of the falling cost of advanced optical electronics detectors, some experiments have begun to take place at optical frequencies as well, Dr. Tarter said. Soon, optical experiments will also begin to look in the infrared portion of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, however, SETILive is adding a new, and already occasionally unpredictable, dimension to the hunt for alien worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since there is no absolute certainty about what a communication from another civilization might look like, the researchers are having to put up with some of the eccentricities of their volunteers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are expecting that every single thing they see is going to be a signal and so they're drawing patterns in noise,'' Dr. Tarter said. ''I had someone send me a face the other day. Here's a noise field, and he saw a face.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trips to weightlessness can squash the eyeballs of astronauts, swell the optic nerves and blur vision -- changes that often persist long after the astronauts return to weightbound Earth. That is one more health effect that NASA will have to worry about before astronauts venture farther out into the solar system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're talking about missions that might be two years round trip, it has to be in the back of your mind that this could be a potential limiting factor,'' said Dr. Larry A. Kramer, a professor of diagnostic imaging and intervention at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kramer and his colleagues have put more than 35 astronauts into high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging machines. This month in the journal Radiology, they reported their findings on the first 27 astronauts they examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the 27 had some swelling around the optic nerve. In seven of the astronauts, the back of one or both of the eyeballs was somewhat flattened. Those abnormalities, Dr. Kramer said, resemble those in patients on terra firma who have a condition in which fluid pressure increases in the skull and presses against the eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kramer said he suspected increased pressure was at the heart of the problem for the astronauts, too. Without the downward pull of gravity, fluids in the body shift higher in the body, including inside the skull. (It is, however, too early to rule out other causes, he said, like the increased radiation that astronauts experience while in orbit.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flattening of the eyes is easily compensated for by eyeglasses, and nearsighted people become less nearsighted. But the M.R.I. scans also revealed little ripples in the back of the eyes of some of the astronauts, distorting their vision in a way that ''would be more disconcerting to us,'' Dr. Kramer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swelling, if untreated, could damage vision, possibly even leading to blindness. The astronauts who had spent longer time in space exhibited more abnormalities, although some of those who had floated in space for less than a month also had eye changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now taking measurements of the eyeballs of all new astronauts it selects and before and after each flight. ''This is a lifelong health issue for astronauts that they're going to be following,'' Dr. Kramer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since missions beyond low-Earth orbit are more than a decade away, NASA has time to figure out solutions. Drugs to alleviate the pressure are one possibility. A more technologically challenging solution would be to spin interplanetary spacecraft to generate artificial gravity for the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA does not currently think that the vision problem will preclude long-duration human space missions,'' said Dr. Richard Williams, NASA's chief health and medical officer, adding that the vision changes have so far had no effect on the ability of astronauts on the International Space Station to complete their missions.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as NASA is on the cusp of answering the most fascinating questions about Mars -- is there, was there or could there be life there? -- the money needed to provide the answers is about to be abruptly withdrawn, a victim of President Obama's budget request for 2013, scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two ambitious missions that NASA had hoped to launch to Mars, in 2016 and 2018, will be canceled. The first would have sent an orbiter to measure gases in the Martian atmosphere -- methane in particular, since methane does not last long. Its presence could suggest that Martian microbes are busy at work emitting the gas (though other explanations are also possible).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second, in 2018, would have set the stage to fulfill the longstanding desire of scientists to bring pieces of Mars back to Earth for close-up study with the full arsenal of instruments available in their laboratories. Now the prospect of bringing Martian rocks to Earth is likely pushed to the mid- or late 2020s, all because of budget cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pipeline is being shut off, and that's not what anyone wants,'' said Bill Nye, executive director of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit group founded by Carl Sagan and others who wanted to foster interest in outer space. ''We are closer than anyone has ever been to discovering life on another world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's budget request for 2013 calls for cutting NASA's robotic exploration of the solar system by 20 percent, to $1.2 billion, and the Mars program would be particularly hard hit. Already, NASA has withdrawn from a collaboration with the European Space Agency that would have launched the missions in 2016 and 2018, angering the Europeans and disappointing astrobiologists and planetary scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We seem to have gotten the drastic cuts relative to other parts of NASA,'' said Raymond E. Arvidson, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. ''Why?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still a few tidbits left. A NASA rover called Curiosity is to land in August and look in ancient sediments for carbon-based molecules that could serve as the building blocks of life. Its instruments could also confirm the controversial claim that Mars' atmosphere contains methane. But Curiosity will not be able to provide definitive answers to the question of ''Could there have been life on Mars?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a modest orbiter mission called Maven, to study Mars' upper atmosphere, remains on track for launching next year. By measuring the escape of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor to space, scientists hope to gain insight into the past climate of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists are dismayed that they are being hamstrung on the brink of major breakthroughs. The problem, they say, stems from NASA trying to cram too many big-ticket items into a $17.7 billion budget -- $1.75 billion less than what Congress had promised a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now NASA's Mars science exploration budget is being decimated,'' Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. ''We're not going back to the moon. Plans for astronauts to visit Mars or anywhere beyond low-Earth orbit are delayed until the 2030s on funding not yet allocated, overseen by a Congress and a president to be named later.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson implored Congress to look beyond the near-term budget travails, noting that of each dollar in taxes sent to Washington, only half a cent is spent on NASA. He told the senators they should double NASA's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moment the culture wants to innovate, that penny on a dollar becomes an investment,'' Dr. Tyson said, arguing that the nation had benefited greatly from the halo effects of the space program in the 1960s and 1970s and has been coasting since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sidelining of the Mars program is one of several depressing developments at NASA. The space shuttles will never fly again, and the agency's reliance on Russian rockets to ferry astronauts to the space station is likely to be extended, because financing of commercial companies to take over that task has been limited. The James Webb Space Telescope, meant as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, is delayed and over budget, now at least six years from being ready. The new heavy-lift rocket that is to take astronauts on faraway missions will not carry any astronauts until 2021. All of the big projects are slipping into the distant future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent March 5, a group of Mars scientists that provides feedback to NASA said it was ''appalled'' by the proposed budget cuts. ''Among the many dire impacts, the cuts threaten the very existence of the Mars exploration program which has been one of the crown jewels of the agency's planetary exploration,'' wrote David J. Des Marais, a scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in California and chairman of the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Curiosity is already finished and launched, ''from this point now forward, there is nothing active in the queue,'' Dr. Des Marais said in an interview. ''The gap begins now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency officials strongly dispute the notion that NASA is being idled. ''We still have very exciting things to do in science,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA will not have anything to launch to Mars in 2016, Dr. Grunsfeld said the agency was aiming to come up with a new mission to fill the 2018 slot. A planning group appointed by Dr. Grunsfeld is to provide a draft framework for a revised, cheaper Mars program this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Europeans could possibly turn to Russia as a new partner for the Mars missions that NASA will no longer pursue. While NASA has laid the groundwork of Mars exploration for the past 15 years, other nations could conceivably swoop in for the most significant discoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only NASA has had any success at landing on Mars, and more likely, whatever mysteries Mars holds will remain mysteries for years longer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnetic eruptions on the Sun on Tuesday and Wednesday released two huge bursts of lights -- two of the largest solar flares over the last five years -- and accelerated a blob of high-speed particles headed toward us. As the charged particles slam the Earth's magnetic field at more than a million miles per hour and are funneled toward the north and south poles, they generate the nighttime light now known as auroras or northern and southern lights.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant solar storms can wreak havoc on satellites and power grids. One storm knocked out power in a large area in Quebec in 1989. The current storm, which started Thursday morning, is not nearly large enough to cause that much trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point it's a minor storm,'' said C. Alex Young, a senior solar physicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ''It's not going to be that big even if the levels increase a bit. This is really not something to be concerned about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, concern did ensue after NASA issued a statement on Wednesday saying that two large solar flares could send ''a severe geomagnetic storm'' toward Earth that could cause ''possible disruption to high frequency radio communication, global positioning systems and power grids.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That announcement caused a storm of its own, sparking numerous hyperbolic news reports about possible dangers to air travel and communications systems from large clouds of charged particles rushing at the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm particles started shaking the Earth's magnetic field Thursday morning, the disturbance was rated only ''minor,'' a 1 on the 1-to-5 scale used to describe the intensity of such storms. The intensity did not crescendo to the ''strong'' threshold as had been predicted. A similar-size storm also hit Earth in late January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, closer to the Sun, the storm was felt more acutely. The splash of intense radiation temporarily blinded the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a five-year lull in strong solar storms because the ferocity and pace of the Sun's flares and magnetic eruptions rise and fall on an 11-year cycle, and the Sun has only recently emerged from its slumber and started generating new solar flares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting the first few snowfalls of the year, so to speak,'' said Robert Rutledge, lead of the forecast office at the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colo., part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the course of a typical cycle, some 200 solar storms as strong as Thursday's will hit Earth. Even though the current cycle appears quieter than usual, such storms could strike Earth a few times a week when the cycle peaks in the next year or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the cycle matches the usual pattern, about a tenth as many of the solar storms -- 10 to 20 -- would reach the stronger, ''severe'' level and one or two would be described as ''extreme.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the most powerful storms that generate real worry. In addition to knocking out power grids, the larger solar storms can also damage satellites or pose a health hazard to astronauts on the International Space Station.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious sign that there is a lot of junk in space is how much of it has been falling out of the sky lately: a defunct NASA satellite last year, a failed Russian space probe this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the odds are tiny that anyone on Earth will be hit, the chances that all this orbiting litter will interfere with working satellites or the International Space Station are getting higher, according to a recent report by the National Research Council.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit group, which dispenses advice on scientific matters, concluded that the problem of extraterrestrial clutter had reached a point where, if nothing was done, a cascade of collisions would eventually make low-Earth orbit unusable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA is taking it very seriously,'' said Mason A. Peck, chief technologist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a straightforward solution: dispose of the space junk, especially big pieces, before they collide and break into smaller ones. Researchers are stepping in with a variety of creative solutions, including nets that would round up wayward items and drag them into the Earth's atmosphere, where they would harmlessly burn up, and balloons that would similarly direct the debris into the atmosphere. Also on the table: firing lasers from the ground. Not to blow things up, which would only make more of a mess, but to nudge them into safer orbits or into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week, researchers at a top Swiss university, the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, announced that they were designing CleanSpace One, a sort of vacuum cleaner in the sky -- an $11 million one -- that will be able to navigate close to a satellite and grab it with a big claw, whereupon both will make a fiery death dive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss have only two satellites in orbit, each smaller than a breadbox, but they are concerned about what to do with them when they stop operating in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to clean up after ourselves,'' said Anton Ivanov, a scientist at the institute's space center. ''That's very Swiss, isn't it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space junk problem is so old and widely acknowledged that it even has a name: the Kessler Syndrome. In 1978, Donald J. Kessler, who led NASA's office of space debris, first predicted the cascade effect that would take place when leftover objects in space started colliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Dr. Kessler is retired in North Carolina but still contemplating the issue -- and the need to clean up. ''The sooner they do it, the cheaper it will be,'' he said. ''The more you wait to start, the more you'll have to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many items whizzing around at more than 17,000 miles per hour and shattering as they crash, the threat to working satellites, which are vital to hurricane tracking, GPS systems and military surveillance, has grown more immediate. Three years ago, a derelict Russian satellite slammed into an Iridium communications satellite, smashing both into tens of thousands of pieces. The Air Force currently tracks 20,000 pieces of orbiting space junk, which includes old rocket parts and dead satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the risk is real but manageable. Satellite operators can dodge the big debris and armor their satellites to withstand impact with smaller pieces. But eventually, if not cleaned up, low-Earth orbit would become too perilous for people and satellites. ''It will be a huge risk for an astronaut to go to space,'' said John L. Junkins, a professor of aerospace engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, adding: ''No one will insure a space launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has about 500 pieces of large space junk, Dr. Junkins said, and Russia about twice that number. ''I'm talking about going after things the size of a Greyhound bus,'' he said. ''Absolutely, this is the heart of the problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking down five or six of the large intact objects each year would be enough to halt the cascade effect, he said. Eliminating 10 a year would quickly reverse the trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has started financing research to come up with some solutions. <span class="companylink">Raytheon</span>, for one, is studying whether a high-altitude balloon might be able to carry a machine that would essentially shoot puffs of air into the path of orbiting debris. Even that slight increase in atmospheric drag could force junk to fall back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It actually doesn't require much,'' said Dr. Peck, NASA's chief technologist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA just gave $1.9 million to Star Technology and Research, a small company in South Carolina, to develop and test technologies for a spacecraft it calls the ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator -- Edde, for short. Powered by a 6-mile-long wire -- make that ''space tether'' -- that generates energy as it is pulled through the Earth's magnetic field, Edde would sidle up to a piece of junk, whip out a disposable net to catch it and then move to a lower orbit, where air friction would coax the item to re-enter the atmosphere. Edde, staying in orbit, would then move on to its next target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerome Pearson, the president of Star Technology, says it would take only a few years and a few hundred million dollars for a fleet of Eddes to clean up the near-Earth neighborhood. (Others suspect that it would take longer and cost more.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology is just one hurdle. International politics might be a more serious one. Space junk, even if it is just junk, still belongs to the nation that put it there. So if the United States tried to lasso part of a spent Russian rocket, Russia would most likely protest. Many nations would certainly worry that a ground-based laser capable of pushing satellites around would also be wielded as a weapon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the space junk problem will not be solved unless everyone launching rockets stops adding to it. The United States has largely done that: all new satellites are now accompanied by plans for how to bring them safely out of orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested setting up a code of conduct for nations to follow, but that may be more easily said than done. European countries have also been putting together a set of ground rules, but the United States called them too restrictive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Junkins of Texas A&amp;M said the United States should not wait for new international agreements, but instead follow the example of the Swiss in cleaning up after itself. ''The U.S. alone could reverse the growth by tackling the several hundred things that we've put there that are our responsibility,'' he said. ''That gives us the moral and technical high ground.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip took the better part of a whole day. Drinking a pint of beer, I had the sudden realization that I really had come back to Earth since that same trip in orbit took about 10 minutes.</p>

But our Russian cosmonaut commander stood up, put the drunk guy in a headlock, dragged him through the aisle of the Tupolev jet and threw him into an open row of seats in the rear of the plane with a threat to kill him if he moved before landing. It worked.</p>

Then he removed his pants, and went for his underwear. Fortunately, security ran over just in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not big on talking to seatmates. I learned my lesson. You say you're an astronaut and the first thing someone wants to know is how an astronaut goes to the bathroom. It's not that complicated, but I am tired of answering the question.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans had yet to recover from the Soviet Union's launching of the first spacecraft, Sputnik, in October 1957 -- a rude jolt to our confidence as world leaders in all things technological. The space race was on.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy had thrown down the challenge to send men to the Moon by the end of the decade. But the Russians still set the pace, boastfully. They launched a dog into orbit, then the first man, Yuri A. Gagarin, and another, Gherman S. Titov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States lagged, managing only two 15-minute suborbital astronaut flights -- only five minutes of weightlessness each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Feb. 20, 1962 -- 50 years ago next Monday -- a Marine Corps fighter pilot from small-town America stepped forward in response to the country's need. The astronaut was John Glenn, whom the author Tom Wolfe has called ''the last true national hero America has ever had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squeezed into the cockpit of a Mercury spacecraft called Friendship 7, launched by an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla., Mr. Glenn circled the Earth three times, becoming the first American to orbit the planet. Perhaps no other spaceflight -- all 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds of it -- has been followed by so many with such paralyzing apprehension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn saw three sunsets and sunrises that Tuesday, from a maximum altitude of 162 miles. At each sunrise, an explosion of what looked like fireflies appeared outside the window, mystifying him. Then came a signal of a suspected problem that had ground controllers bracing for an uncertain, possibly catastrophic re-entry into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ending was a happy one. A collective sigh of relief was heard across the land. The president rushed off to Cape Canaveral to hail the returning hero. Bands played. Ticker tape streamed from the high windows of Broadway. People cried. Never mind that a Soviet cosmonaut had already spent 25 hours in orbit. As Mr. Wolfe has written, ''John Glenn made us whole again!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at 90, Mr. Glenn was reminded in one of two lengthy interviews that the author of ''The Right Stuff'' had judged him the country's last true hero. His response was a kind of dismissive aw shucks. ''Hero'' is an elastic word, after all, stretchable to fit a favorite ballplayer or a great conqueror in war or discovery -- almost anyone admirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think of myself that way,'' Mr. Glenn said. ''I get up each day and have the same problems others have at my age. As far as trying to analyze all the attention I received, I will leave that to others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(For his part, Mr. Wolfe stood by his characterization, saying a national hero was someone seen as ''a great protector'' of the people. ''He really wasn't their protector, but that's what people felt and thought,'' he said of Mr. Glenn in an interview last week. ''He made them cry, and this made him a hero.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, Mr. Glenn will again get a hero's welcome at Cape Canaveral for a reunion with the dwindling Mercury space team, those remaining managers, engineers and technicians who sent the first Americans into space. On Monday and Tuesday, he will be honored with a dinner and a spaceflight forum at Ohio State University, home of the John Glenn School of Public Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn keeps an office at the school, holds seminars with students and is close to the archive of papers from his careers as an astronaut and, later, a four-term United States senator from Ohio and a candidate in the 1984 Democratic presidential primaries. It is quite an archive: about 1,800 boxes of materials. ''I was a pack rat,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Anna (he calls her Annie), divide their time between a house in a suburb of Washington and a condominium in Columbus. She was his childhood sweetheart, and their marriage has stood the test of almost 69 years of devotion in the turbulence of spaceflight and politics. From the time they came to public attention, each has seemed the other's center of gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through years of therapy, Mr. Glenn said, Annie has overcome the severe stammer that had made her ill at ease at public appearances. ''She can give speeches now,'' he said, and she likes talking to students of speech pathology. Both have had knee-replacement surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their knees had made it hard for them, especially Annie, to climb on the wing and into the cabin of their twin-engine Beechcraft Baron. They used to fly it on vacations and back and forth to Washington, sometimes logging as many as 160 airborne hours a year. Last month, as a concession to their aging knees, the Glenns sold their airplane, but Mr. Glenn was pleased to say he still has a valid pilot's license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other honored guest at the anniversary events in Cape Canaveral will be M. Scott Carpenter, the Mercury astronaut who was Mr. Glenn's backup and radio link, called capcom, in the launching blockhouse that day of flight. The two are the only surviving members of what were known as the Mercury Seven. Virgil I. Grissom died in 1967 in an Apollo spacecraft fire during a launching-pad test. Donald K. Slayton died of cancer in 1993. Alan B. Shepard Jr. died of leukemia in 1998. L. Gordon Cooper Jr. died of natural causes in 2004. Walter M. Schirra Jr. died of a heart attack in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, his last year in the Senate, the first American to orbit Earth became, at 77, the oldest person to travel in space. Mr. Glenn felt he still had enough of the right stuff. He had continued to pilot his own airplane and had kept in shape -- ''attitude and exercise,'' he said, ''that's what keeps you going'' -- and he persuaded NASA to let him fly on the space shuttle Discovery and conduct tests on the physiological effects of nine days of weightlessness on older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recent interviews, Mr. Glenn said, ''I am not at all happy with some of the directions the space program is going, in particular retiring the space shuttles before we have a new heavy-lift launching system in place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn said he was concerned that since the final shuttle flight last July, the United States must depend on the Russian Soyuz space vehicles for ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station, assembled in orbit at a cost well over $100 billion, mainly from American taxpayers. The Soyuz is limited to three passengers and about 125 pounds of gear, hardly sufficient for hauling replacement parts for the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the Russians had a hiccup with Soyuz, our manned space program would be ended, maybe for years,'' Mr. Glenn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a meeting with President Obama two years ago, Mr. Glenn made his case for continuing shuttle flights and full space station operations for several more years, contrary to President George W. Bush's policy that a new generation of boosters and spacecraft would be developed with the savings from the cancellation of shuttle operations. ''The president didn't disagree with any of my arguments,'' he recalled. ''He said we just don't have the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Glenn settled into recollections of that February day in 1962, the interview glided into easy conversation over shared memories. Ten times over almost a month the launching was scheduled, only to be scrubbed because of poor weather or mechanical glitches. ''On again, off again,'' Mr. Glenn said. ''I actually suited up four times, and two times was up on top of the Atlas, strapped into Friendship 7, ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporters from all over the world grew restive, desperate for anything to write about. After one cancellation, Mercury information officers begged Mr. Glenn to give them something to tell the journalists. When he got off the booster, he went running on the beach and happened to see where sea turtles had buried their eggs. This was duly reported, and one writer remarked that it was understood the astronaut had a good recipe for turtle egg soup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well, that got me into a whole lot of trouble with environmentalists,'' Mr. Glenn recalled. ''I got mail calling me everything but a good guy, and should be replaced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waiting got so tiresome for the press corps that when a waitress at one of the watering holes was shot dead by her boyfriend around midnight, some reporters rushed to file the story. A London tabloid declared it ''the first successful shot here in weeks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn said he had not heard that tale before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last, on the 11th attempt, with his backup, Mr. Carpenter, bidding ''Godspeed, John Glenn,'' Friendship 7 lifted off for its three orbits of Earth. Christopher C. Kraft Jr., the flight director, remembers, ''Nothing about John Glenn's flight was easy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first sunrise, Mr. Glenn saw a swarm of greenish-yellow lights outside the craft, reminding him of fireflies. He saw them again at the other sunrises. ''No one had anticipated this, and it was fascinating,'' he said. ''Turns out these were tiny moisture particles vented from the heat-exchange system, but I don't know if we have ever explained their particular colors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near the end of the first orbit, trouble with the automatic control system forced Mr. Glenn to take manual control for much of the remaining orbits. He felt he was truly the pilot, not a passenger on autopilot. Not ''Spam in a can,'' in the minds of the veteran test pilots unimpressed by these new astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then a signal sent to the ground warned of a potentially more serious problem. It indicated that the craft had a loose heat shield. Flight controllers suspected it was a spurious signal, but could not be sure. They decided not to jettison the retro rockets after they braked the capsule for its descent. The retro-pack should keep the heat shield in place and prevent serious damage to the capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Glancing out the window during re-entry,'' Mr. Glenn recalled, ''I was seeing big chunks of something coming off. It was the retro-pack, not the heat shield, thank goodness. It had been a false alarm. If you go to the Air and Space Museum in Washington, you can see the burn patterns on Friendship 7.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the epilogue to ''The Right Stuff,'' his best seller on the original seven astronauts, Mr. Wolfe wrote that the day of Glenn the hero ''when an astronaut could parade up Broadway while traffic policemen wept in the intersections,'' was no more. An era, he continues, ''had come, and it had gone, perhaps never to be relived.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a time short of heroes, John Glenn keeps alive the memory.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARMEL VALLEY, Calif. -- Just in time for Valentine's Day comes the ultimate gift for the Dr. Strangelove in your life: the 21,000-square-foot Jamesburg Earth Station, a satellite relay base from the 1960s that was built to survive a nuclear attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perched on a remote hillside overlooking the Ventana Wilderness here on California's Central Coast, it is a white elephant that costs $3 million, a tech-lover's paradise on 161 acres equipped with a 97-foot satellite dish. (Though the signs reading ''Danger: High Voltage'' are perhaps not the best marketing tool.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its glory days, this sprawling bunkerlike redoubt on Comsat Road played an essential role in national life. Built in 1968 by the Communications Satellite Corporation, the Jamesburg Earth Station and nearly a dozen others like it helped bring the first televised images of Neil Armstrong on the moon and President Richard M. Nixon in Beijing into America's living rooms. They also pulled in signals from satellites in geostationary orbit that made international telephone calls fast and easily accessible for most Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the ultimate man cave,'' said Jeffrey W. Bullis, a Silicon Valley electronics mogul, who bought the property in 2004 for $2 million from <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> and is now selling it, complete with the hand-carved Tiki gods from Vanuatu that he placed at the entrance as a homey touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiber optics made the station's technology obsolete. Mr. Bullis, 56, who develops security systems for nuclear plants and other sites, had hoped to develop an Internet business there. When that did not prove feasible, he said, he proceeded with Plan B: turning the Jamesburg Earth Station into a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is Love,'' he said during a tour, indicating one of the would-be bedrooms that he christened on the building's perimeter. ''This is Peace. This is Happiness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A time-stood-still feeling pervades the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one room, there are 14 file cabinets of blueprints, seemingly untouched for decades; in another, the dusty air filtration system emits a low wheeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cinder block walls are lined with vintage cold war images: a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll and a nighttime shot of an Intelsat II satellite launching in a cometlike streak of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Ramey, 69, a retired technical supervisor at the station, said he had fond memories of the Operational Room, the size of a football field, where he and his colleagues, many of them retired military personnel, worked in jackets and ties in front of control panels. The highlight of his career, he said, was being able to listen to astronauts on a mission, and he recalled the fleeting ''concern'' in the voices of the Apollo 10 crew members in May 1969 as they scoped out the moon in anticipation of the first landing by Apollo 11 that summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bullis set up an adjoining room as an indoor shooting range, stacking it with hay bales for target practice with a variety of weapons, including his prized .375 H&amp;H Magnum. ''You name it, we've shot it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He mostly lives in Redwood City, Calif., between San Francisco and San Jose. The home that Mr. Bullis built there is a replica of a stone manor house that he had admired in Bayonne, France. He had planned to make the earth station his weekend home, and he tweaked the dish's position from a right angle to a position parallel to the ground so that it looks like it is levitating by the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hoped to transform the operations center into a living room and master bedroom separated by a circular fire pit, and hired R. Wayne Johnson, a local architect and engineer, to reimagine the place as a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said ''it's a very stable building,'' with a five-foot reinforced-concrete roof and double layers of reinforced steel. ''We envisioned a flow between interior and exterior,'' he added, including the use of folding glass panels that would lead to an outdoor dining area overlooking chardonnay grape vineyards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bullis abandoned his plans for the station and decided to sell when his youngest son, Adam, died of leukemia at age 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deluge of ''tire kickers and yahoos'' showed up, said Bert Aronson, a broker with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Carmel, Calif., who is the listing agent. So he decided to market the property online at jamesburgearthstation.com and valleyvintagestorage.com to better screen interested buyers. Mr. Aronson says potential uses include wine or car storage or a computer data center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Saffo, who forecasts technology trends in Silicon Valley, said that he hoped the buyer would appreciate the earth station's history and that it would be perfect for an amateur astronomer. ''It's in the danger zone,'' he said. ''Someone is going to have to be really crazy and really rich to buy it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Vanderbilt, the author of ''Survival City: Adventures Among the Ruins of Atomic America,'' noted that many cold war structures had been abandoned, ''too old to be technologically useful but too new to be venerated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They exist,'' he said, ''in cultural limbo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jamesburg Earth Station is the equivalent of a frontier fort, ''the frontier being the militarized battleground of space,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, with Newt Gingrich using his presidential campaign to talk about the danger of an ''electromagnetic pulse'' attack, perhaps the earth station will develop a new generation of survivalist fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, its recreational possibilities make for potentially riveting cocktail chatter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, Mr. Bullis decided to use the satellite dish for a ''moon bounce,'' projecting his voice into space and back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love life,'' he confessed to the moon. ''I love my country. I love my family. And I love this place.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating on money and equipment scrounged from the public and from Silicon Valley millionaires, and on the stubborn strength of their own dreams, a band of astronomers recently restarted one of the iconic quests of modern science, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence -- SETI, for short -- which had been interrupted last year by a lack of financing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, a brace of 42 radio telescopes, known as the Allen Telescope Array, nestled here in the shadow of Lassen Peak, came to life and resumed hopping from star to star in the constellation Cygnus, listening for radio broadcasts from alien civilizations. The lines are now open, but with lingering financial problems, how long they will remain that way is anybody's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These should be boom times for those seeking out aliens, or at least their radio proxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers now know that the galaxy is teeming with at least as many planets -- the presumed sites of life -- as stars. Advanced life and technology might be rare in the cosmos, said Geoffrey W. Marcy, the Watson and Marilyn Alberts in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence professor at the University of California, Berkeley, ''but surely they are out there, because the number of Earthlike planets in the Milky Way galaxy is simply too great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple ''howdy,'' a squeal or squawk, or an incomprehensible stream of numbers captured by one of the antennas here at the University of California's Hat Creek Radio Observatory would be enough to end our cosmic loneliness and change history, not to mention science. It would answer one of the most profound questions humans ask: Are we alone in the universe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite decades of space probes and billions of NASA dollars looking for life out there, there is still only one example of life in the universe: the DNA-based web of biology on Earth. ''In this field,'' said Jill Tarter, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., the ''number two is the all-important number. We count one, two, infinity. We're all looking for number two.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story of SETI is the story of a dream deferred by politics, a lack of money and the technological challenges of searching what astronomers call ''the cosmic haystack'': 100 billion stars in the galaxy and 9 billion narrow-band radio channels on which aliens, if they exist, might be trying to hail us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politics and the recession have crimped astronomers' budgets and left the institute's scientists with a kind of siege mentality. Last spring, the University of California ran out of money to run the Hat Creek observatory, forcing the Allen telescopes into hibernation. In order to continue the search, astronomers are negotiating a deal to share the telescopes with the Air Force, which wants to use them to track satellites and space junk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No federal funds have been spent searching for radio signals from extraterrestrials since 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent visit to the SETI Institute's Mountain View offices found many of the cubicles empty and the corridors eerily quiet. Last summer, as the Allen telescopes slumbered, weeds grew around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">998,000 Stars to Go</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story begins with a young radio astronomer named Frank Drake, who pointed an antenna from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., at a pair of stars in 1960, wondering if he could make contact with anything or anyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All he got was static, but the hook was set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1971, NASA held a workshop led by Barney Oliver, the research chief of <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, that concluded the best way to find extraterrestrials was with a $10 billion array of giant radio telescopes called Cyclops. The price tag -- as well as the subject -- set off alarm bells that still reverberate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1978, Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, an outspoken critic of what he considered wasteful government spending, awarded one of his infamous ''Golden Fleece'' awards to the hunt for aliens, and in 1993, a NASA-sponsored survey for signals from 1,000 nearby stars was canceled by Congress. With the help of friends like Dr. Oliver in the Silicon Valley, Dr. Tarter and her colleagues took the search private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the director of SETI research at the institute, Dr. Tarter, 67, has become the public face of the cause, and she was consulted by the actress Jodie Foster about her portrayal of Ellie Arroway, a radio astronomer who finds a signal, in the movie ''Contact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tarter was recruited in 1976, when, as a postdoctorate student at Berkeley, she read the Cyclops report, a rite of passage for most alien-oriented astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You didn't have to ask a priest or philosopher about life in the universe,'' Dr. Tarter said. But she realized she was in the first generation who could conduct experiments about it. A half-century and roughly 2,000 stars later, humanity is still officially alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Drake is undaunted, noting that there are 100 billion suitable stars in the galaxy. His personal estimate, based on an equation he invented in 1961, is that there are 10,000 technological civilizations in the galaxy, one per million stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've known all along we have to look at a million stars,'' he said. Now a cherubic 81, Dr. Drake is a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a former chairman of the SETI Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Allen Array, which was designed to find Dr. Drake his million stars, is named after Paul G. Allen, the <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder and philanthropist, who put up $25 million to get the project going. Jointly owned and operated by the University of California, Berkeley, and the SETI Institute, it was to consist of 350 antennas, 20 feet in diameter, that were to be mass-produced like satellite dishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full array would be able to map a swath of sky several full moons in diameter in only 10 minutes, or the whole sky in a night -- of great interest to astronomers and, as it turned out, to the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Allen's contribution was only enough to build 42 antennas, which started operating in 2007. The astronomers say that another $55 million would complete the array, but there have been no volunteers yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project got a lift in 2009 when Dr. Tarter won a $100,000 prize and ''One Wish to Change the World'' at the TED conference -- short for Technology, Entertainment and Design -- in Long Beach, Calif. Her talk there began, ''The story of humans is the story of ideas.'' It elicited a donation of valuable equipment from Dell and Intel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project got another lift -- mainly psychological -- last year when NASA, whose Kepler spacecraft is beaming back news about the patch of Cygnus that it surveys, published its first list of 1,235 exoplanet candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Tarter told a conference of exoplanet hunters recently: ''We're not just pointing at stars. We're pointing where you have shown us there are planets, and perhaps technologists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recession and the cutbacks that followed wiped out the university's funds to run the Hat Creek observatory just as it was getting started on a survey of Kepler's planets. The Allen telescopes went quiet, and the astronomical staff left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appeal for financing went out on the institute's Web site, which eventually brought in about $220,000 -- roughly two months' worth of operating expenses. Meanwhile, the Air Force was interested in using the radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array, Dr. Tarter explained, turns out to be adept at tracking satellites and space junk, a possibility first identified as early as 2004 in a memo by her husband, William Welch, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is known as Jack. ''There's a long tradition of radio astronomy and the military scratching each other's backs,'' Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under terms of an agreement still being negotiated, the Air Force will pay for a share of the operations at Hat Creek, which costs about $1.5 million (plus another $1 million a year to pay the astronomers). The money raised so far will buy a few months at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome All Species</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers started bringing their equipment back to Hat Creek in September. The place looked neglected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody had cut the weeds,'' Dr. Tarter said. ''It looked so sad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, when Dr. Tarter and Dr. Welch returned to Hat Creek in Dr. Welch's Cessna with a reporter in tow, the weeds had been cut and the antennas were majestically turning to a music only they could hear. Scattered across a meadow, they resembled the forest of satellite dishes you see outside events like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby in an unassuming ranch house, racks of electronics and computers hummed with life. The doormat read, ''Welcome All Species.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, Dr. Tarter plopped down in front of a computer and watched with a suspicious eye as the display popped with a row of numbers indicating that a narrow-band signal -- the signature of an artificial source -- had been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She takes great pride in the fact that she and her colleagues have never published a false alarm, and she nodded approvingly as the telescope and computers went through the process of eliminating the new signal from consideration. The Earth's motion will cause the frequency of a signal from the sky to drift in frequency, for example. The checklist has grown over the years, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few minutes they were back scanning a new part of the spectrum. The computers will check a persistent signal five times, moving the telescope on and off it, before calling someone to discuss it -- ''whoever is on the desk,'' Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next step would be to call the director of an observatory to the west (since that is the way the sky rotates) and ask for continued observation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've gotten six hours into it four times,'' Dr. Tarter said. One dramatic moment was in 1998, when Dr. Tarter and her colleagues were working at the observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., and had a signal they could just not eliminate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally they figured out that they were actually receiving transmissions from the European SOHO satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went to bed,'' Dr. Tarter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a real adrenaline pumping time,'' she added. ''I can't imagine what the real deal will be.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the United States establish a moon colony and develop a new propulsion system for going to Mars? All within eight years of a Newt Gingrich presidency, as Mr. Gingrich promised this week?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answers seem to be technologically yes, economically iffy and politically very difficult.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In proposing an ambitious vision for space, Mr. Gingrich stepped into the eternal debate over where the nation's and NASA's priorities should lie. Mr. Gingrich spoke little about NASA's unmanned missions, which many think produce better science with less money. Inspiration and economic frontiers, not science, drive his long-standing enthusiasm for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I come at space from a standpoint of a romantic belief that it really is part of our destiny,'' Mr. Gingrich said in his speech on Wednesday. He joked about a legislative proposal, early in his Congressional career, that a moon colony could apply for statehood once its population reached 13,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, at a debate on Thursday, Mr. Gingrich's Republican opponents lambasted a moon colony as a loony, budget-busting idea in a time of fiscal austerity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney said he thought a moon base would cost hundred of billions of dollars or more. ''I'd rather be rebuilding housing here in the U.S.,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Paul quipped, ''I think we maybe should send some politicians up there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smallest hurdle is technology. After all, sending astronauts back to the moon by 2020 and setting up a permanent home there was the goal of the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and NASA had embarked on developing new rockets and spacecraft to accomplish that. Few doubted that, given enough money and time, NASA would be able to duplicate its success of more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A permanent moon base could adapt technologies used in building the International Space Station. NASA was also developing an R.V.-like lunar vehicle where astronauts could drive around the surface of the Moon for weeks at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But money was the problem. When the program, known as Constellation, did not receive as much financing as originally promised, development fell behind, pushing up the price tag. A review of experts concluded that it would cost $150 billion for Constellation to reach its destination close to the original schedule. The Obama administration instead canceled it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new NASA program similar to Constellation with brand new rockets would be similarly expensive. But a recent NASA study concluded that the space agency could use smaller existing rockets, coupled with fueling stations in orbit, to reach the Moon within a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new propulsion system for going to Mars would likely call for reviving old technology -- nuclear-powered rocket engines that were originally developed in the 1950s. NASA has already begun work on nuclear propulsion -- nuclear reactors that provide continuous thrust -- but lacks the money to finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gingrich talked of overturning the status quo at NASA, pushing to work faster, to accept greater risks and let private companies take the lead role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not something that should be mocked or should be seen as a remote possibility,'' said Michael Gold, director of the Washington office of <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, a private space company. ''The reason this is both possible and economically viable is that many of the systems and technology, if not all, already exist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigelow, using technology licensed from NASA, has plans to launch two inflatable space stations, capable of housing 36 people, and the same technology could be scaled up to provide living quarters on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich proposed setting aside about 10 percent of NASA's budget for prizes, similar to the $25,000 that Charles Lindbergh won for being the first to fly across the Atlantic, or, more recently, the $10 million X Prize for commercial spacecraft to rise above the 62-mile-high edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over eight years, this would create a prize pot of more than $14 billion. Mr. Gingrich suggested offering a $10 billion prize for the first venture to make a trip to Mars. If no one succeeds, taxpayers pay nothing. If someone does, $10 billion would be cheaper, by a factor of 10 or 100, than any government-run program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large aerospace companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> would likely pass on the prizes -- it would be a tough sell to investors when the payoff could be nothing at all -- but Mr. Gingrich's allies, including Bob Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, believe that technology billionaires like Jeffrey Bezos, founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, would willingly invest their own money in hopes of fame, if not fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether any of these ideas could win enough political support is another question. When Mr. Obama called for the cancellation of Constellation, he proposed that NASA rely much more on commercial companies in the future, echoing many of the same themes that Mr. Gingrich is advocating. Mr. Gingrich even wrote an opinion piece lauding Mr. Obama's proposed plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Gingrich, a longtime space enthusiast, seems more likely to spend the political capital to push his proposals. Charles Miller, formerly a senior adviser at NASA for commercial space, said all of the pieces of Mr. Gingrich's space plans were plausible if not fleshed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The improbable thing at this point is if Newt will become president,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a Moon Colony Would Require</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Rockets capable of carrying astronauts and cargo to the moon. NASA is developing a new heavy-lift rocket. Newt Gingrich suggests smaller existing rockets could suffice. But smaller rockets would make the mission more complicated because moon-lander pieces would have to be assembled in orbit, as was the Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* A spacecraft that can land on the moon. Such a craft does not exist, but no big technology leaps are needed since NASA did this more than 40 years ago when astronauts landed on the moon. For a permanent base, a larger craft would be needed to ferry the pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Habitats where the astronauts would live. Years ago, NASA began preliminary designs but did not progress far before the program was canceled. A commercial company, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, believes its technology of inflatable modules can be adapted for lunar habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anything built on the moon would have to withstand the sharp-edged lunar dust and large temperature swings, which go from -200 to +200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

New York has one in a vault at a museum in Albany, but another one given to the state for safekeeping was not kept very safe, because it appears to be missing, though the attorney general's office has started looking into the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long-lost one in Colorado resurfaced at the home of a former governor, and another one in Arkansas was found among former President Bill Clinton's memorabilia. Somebody swiped one from a museum in the island country of Malta, and somebody else who got his hands on one in Honduras tried to sell it in Miami to an undercover federal agent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rare art? Priceless jewels? Nothing so terrestrial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these items were literally out of this world: moon rocks, meteorite samples and other so-called astromaterials that were lent to researchers by NASA or were offered as gifts to American and foreign leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of moon rocks and other space objects have been lost, destroyed, stolen or remain unaccounted for, some of which American astronauts and presidents presented to dignitaries around the country and the world decades ago and others that NASA officials lent for education, research and public display. The objects survived in outer space for ages and include some of the first samples ever returned from another planetary body, but after just a few short years on Earth they met the same fate as a set of car keys or a 29-cent postcard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six meteorite samples lost in the mail in 2004 were headed to a lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington and have never been seen since. In 1978, NASA lent a lunar sample disk to the Mount Cuba Astronomical Observatory in Greenville, Del. By the time NASA inquired about the disk more than 30 years later, the manager responsible for it had died and the disk -- a six-inch diameter disk with soil and rock materials from the moon -- was gone. NASA says the observatory could not locate it, but a member of the observatory's board of trustees maintains that the manager sent it back to NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A piece of the moon weighing 1.1 grams -- among lunar samples collected by Apollo 17 astronauts in December 1972 -- was given to the governor of West Virginia more than one year later. Its whereabouts were unknown in recent years, until the fragment resurfaced in June 2010, in a box in the basement game room of Robert T. Conner, a retired dentist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only connection between him and the governor who was presented the lunar fragment, Arch A. Moore Jr., was Mr. Conner's brother, who died in 2002. Mr. Moore had been a lawyer in the Washington law firm that the brother owned, and the box containing the fragment included items from the man's office. The fragment was about the size of a dime, encased in a Lucite ball and mounted on a wooden plaque, and Mr. Conner had never given it much thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was not eye-catching at all, that's for sure,'' said Mr. Conner, 76. ''I've seen better-looking bowling trophies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA's inspector general, Paul K. Martin, determined that 517 moon rocks and other astromaterial samples that were lent between 1970 and 2010 had been lost or stolen. A report issued by Mr. Martin's office found that 11 of the 59 researchers in the Houston and Washington areas who were audited could not account for all of the samples NASA had lent them, or the agency found other discrepancies, including researchers who had items that according to agency records either did not exist or had been lent to others. The space agency had also failed to update its records for 12 researchers who had died, retired or relocated, in some instances without returning the samples. One researcher, the report noted, still had lunar samples he had borrowed 35 years earlier though he never conducted research on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that Johnson Space Center's Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office in Houston, which maintains NASA's collection of 163,000 astromaterial samples, lacked sufficient control over its loans of moon rocks and other items for research, education and public display. The samples that American and foreign dignitaries received as gifts were not included in the report, because the space agency does not track them. Moon-rock experts say NASA should keep an inventory of those as well, and they estimate that of nearly 400 moon rocks given to state and world leaders after the Apollo 11 and 17 missions, almost 200 have been lost, destroyed or stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spokesmen for NASA in Washington and Houston said the losses reported by the inspector general represented only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of astromaterial samples the space agency had lent to scientists around the world for more than 40 years. In particular, the lost samples from the moon amounted to less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of the samples that were safely returned in the past four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although such losses at any time are regrettable, and NASA agrees with the I.G. report that continuing to improve certain procedures could reduce the rate at which they occur, the benefits to science of making these samples available for study have vastly outweighed the tiny risk of loss,'' a NASA spokesman in Houston, William P. Jeffs, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they were implementing the recommendations in the report, which called for the space agency to require loan agreements for all types of materials and strengthen the inventory verification process, among other steps. Mr. Jeffs said that although several researchers involved in losing samples were reprimanded in letters from NASA, their research privileges were not revoked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few Americans have been as focused on moon rocks as Joseph R. Gutheinz Jr., a Texas lawyer who keeps a spinning globe on his desk reading, ''Moon Rock Hunter.'' The title is not official (the globe was a gift from one of his sons), but it might as well be: Mr. Gutheinz and his criminal justice students at the University of Phoenix and Alvin Community College in Alvin, Tex., have helped track down 77 moon rocks that were missing, including those presented to governors in Colorado, Missouri and West Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If someone hands a governor a moon rock, and he keeps it or loses it, if you can't protect something like that, maybe they're not that vigilant,'' said Mr. Gutheinz, a retired senior special agent in NASA's inspector general office. ''And if they're not that careful, and they bring it home with them, what else have they brought home with them?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gutheinz was the undercover agent who led a Miami sting operation to recover a moon rock stolen in Honduras in 1998. It was called Operation Lunar Eclipse. Mr. Gutheinz ran an advertisement in USA Today reading, ''Moon Rocks Wanted,'' and a man called offering to sell him a real moon rock. The asking price was $5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE United States has been out of the space shuttle business for a few months now, but the country is still seriously considering spending billions of dollars to send astronauts back to the moon, to Mars or to a nearby asteroid.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's heartening that the pioneering spirit behind crewed missions into outer space has not been dampened by the nation's tide of red ink. But with price tags like $50 billion to return astronauts to the moon in the next decade, there's a strong bang-for-the-buck argument to be made for far less expensive missions headed in the other direction: down into the ocean depths, which remain largely unexplored and unseen by human eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's limited experience with undersea missions has nonetheless shown the great potential for scientific and technological advances and valuable spinoffs that come when public investments are made in bold exploratory ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, an accidental death helped sink the United States Navy's Sealab program. A diver's breathing gear apparently malfunctioned in the dark cold just outside the lab, an astounding 610 feet below the surface. It was a sobering reminder of the inherent risks of making prolonged deep dives. The risks include not only the bends -- the painful and potentially lethal consequence of surfacing too rapidly -- but also breathing exotic gas mixtures (ordinary air becomes toxic beyond certain depths and pressures) and exposure to the frigid temperatures of the deep sea. Conditions underwater can be every bit as hostile as in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sealab had been showing the way toward establishing outposts on the ocean floor, albeit in the shadow of NASA's space program. The Navy program achieved major breakthroughs that made it possible, for the first time, to house free-swimming divers on the seabed, and at far greater depths than ever thought possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike conventional divers, who are limited to brief forays from the surface, these aquanauts -- as sea-dwelling divers have been called -- could not only reach greater depths, but they could also stay down for an indefinite period, spending hours at a time in the water instead of minutes, provided they had a pressurized, climate-controlled shelter nearby. The advent of the aquanaut meant that a vast and varied submerged frontier was open to human exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Navy had an interest in science and exploration, it was mainly concerned with what aquanauts could do for the military, like recovering sunken aircraft, ships or downed submarines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the beneficiaries of the Sealab program was the offshore oil industry. The revolutionary diving methods devised for Sealab emerged just as the industry was moving into deeper waters and needed an expanded underwater work force that could handle both increased depths and longer durations. The industry customized and streamlined its approach so that commercial divers could put in full-day shifts on the seabed without actually having to live down there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Navy ultimately gave up on Sealab and sea bases, largely because they didn't suit its military priorities. The program was shelved after the accident in February 1969, a few months shy of the first moon landing. But the Navy continued to use its newfangled diving methods in other operations -- like top-secret missions to spy on the former Soviet Union. This involved housing deep-diving aquanauts on submarines rather than in a stationary base like Sealab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several dozen science-oriented underwater shelters came and went around the globe, including a few made in the United States. Most were productive but relatively low-budget affairs, as is the United States' only remaining sea base, which is also the world's only such base. It's an otherworldly looking structure called Aquarius, about the size of a city bus, which is owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and run by the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. It gets by on less than $3 million a year, compared to, say, the cost of a single shuttle mission, which NASA has estimated to be $450 million (other estimates have been considerably higher). The entire Sealab program cost taxpayers about $20 million; close to $20 billion was spent during the same period to reach the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE the early 1990s, Aquarius has been stationed on a coral reef a few miles south of Key Largo, Fla., in water about 60 feet deep. There, it has carried on the legacy of Sealab by serving as a valuable undersea vantage point for scientists. Dozens of scientist-aquanauts have published 300 research papers over the course of about 120 missions, ranging in duration from a few days to a couple of weeks. Examples of the work made possible by these underwater stays include ocean acidification studies and examinations of how herbivore diversity may be manipulated to conserve and restore degrading reefs -- knowledge critical to life on earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archaeologists would benefit greatly by having an underwater base of operations. So might commercial interests in search of mineral deposits. And as in space, one line of inquiry may open the door to another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remotely operated probes, robots, sensors and vehicles, known as R.O.V.'s, also have their place in ocean research, much as they do in space. Such machines can be more cost effective, reach greater depths and keep human beings out of harm's way. The government's own Okeanos Explorer, a converted naval surveillance ship, is making impressive use of R.O.V.'s and other devices to churn up reams of data about the seafloor while engaging many scientists in its process of discovery. But sometimes there's just no substitute for the presence of a sentient human, perhaps no more so than in the dynamic, living realm of ''the silent world,'' as Jacques Cousteau famously called the sea. Marine scientists who have experienced the aquatic life will tell you: there's nothing like living in the sea to gain a better understanding of it, for much the same reason that Jane Goodall lived in the jungle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides accomplishing their intended goals, scientists are able to see and experience the unexpected, at any time of day or night, and new revelations await -- like the discovery of a marine plant or animal that could produce the next wonder drug. In the meantime, getting better acquainted with our home planet, at prices we can afford, is reason enough to continue paying for Aquarius, expand its capability and replicate it elsewhere in the silent world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri O. Rogozin said that Russian investigators would run tests on a model satellite to determine whether the type and strength of radiation produced by the radar system could have interfered with the Phobos-Grunt probe as it orbited overhead.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope it's not so, but if it is, we will accordingly draw the necessary conclusions,'' Mr. Rogozin said. ''It's still too early to tell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several American radar installations have been mentioned for study. One is in Alaska; another, in the Marshall Islands, was studying the trajectory of an asteroid at the time of Phobos-Grunt's failure in November, a Russian space industry official told Kommersant, a daily newspaper. Russian officials have also suggested that the 13-ton probe, which fell out of orbit and burned up in the atmosphere on Sunday, scattering some debris over the Pacific Ocean, might have been struck by an anti-satellite weapon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Alexander Zakharov, science secretary at the Institute of Space Research, said it was unlikely that the probe's failure could have been caused by American radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can come up with lots of exotic reasons, but first you need to look at the device and see if there's a problem there,'' he said, according to RIA Novosti news agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogozin said the failures of the Russian space industry in the 1990s may have played a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main thing now is to rid us of the consequences of the unpleasant 1990s, when production fell sharply and the potential of the rocket and space industry was depressed,'' he told another news agency, Interfax. ''We now see that the failures in space are connected to defects in the equipment that was produced some 12 to 13 years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phobos-Grunt, which was meant to spend 2 1/2 years traveling to Phobos, a moon of Mars, and returning a soil sample to Earth, was launched Nov. 9 from the Russian spaceport in Kazakhstan, but an engine that was supposed to boost it out of Earth orbit failed to ignite, and scientists on the ground were unable to correct the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phobos-Grunt spacecraft had been circling Earth since shortly after its launching on Nov. 9, losing a few miles of altitude each day until it fell into the atmosphere. The 13-ton ship was one of the heaviest manmade objects yet to make an uncontrolled plunge back to Earth, though most of its weight was fuel and probably burned up during re-entry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vehicle could have crashed almost anywhere, but as with other falling space junk, the odds were that it would hit an ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Aleksei Zolotukhin, a spokesman for Russia's Aerospace Defense Troops, told the Interfax news agency that the spacecraft, which broke up in the atmosphere, hit the water in fragments around 12:45 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash cut short what was to have been an ambitious two-and-a-half-year voyage to Phobos, one of Mars's two small moons, and back again. The mission to retrieve the first soil sample from a Martian moon would have been a milestone for Russia. The Phobos-Grunt's lander was equipped with a small shovel to put about eight ounces of dirt into a tiny capsule to return to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission started with a successful launching to Earth orbit, but the engine that was meant to boost the spacecraft out of orbit and on its way to Mars failed to fire, and scientists on the ground were unable to correct the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars exploration has been a consistent goal of the Soviet and then Russian space program despite a history of setbacks. The $170 million Phobos-Grunt craft was the first attempt since 1996, when an earlier Mars probe also failed soon after launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculating last week about possible causes of the latest failure, the director of the Russian space agency said that Phobos-Grunt might have been hit by an antisatellite weapon from an unspecified source while over the Western Hemisphere and out of direct observation from Russia. He also mentioned possible technical flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western scientists have dismissed as improbable the speculation by a retired Russian general that a powerful radar antenna in Alaska, intended to study the ionosphere, had zapped the Mars probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Phobos-Grunt broke up and burned on re-entry, the Russian space agency said, as many as about two dozen pieces might have reached the surface, weighing a total of about 400 pounds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did not say who would want to interfere with the spacecraft, which was intended to explore a moon of Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian craft, named Phobos-Grunt for the moon and the Russian word for ground, ran into trouble soon after it was launched in November, when its rockets failed to lift it out of low Earth orbit. What was to have been a two-and-a-half-year interplanetary journey to retrieve a soil sample from Phobos will instead end over the weekend, according to Russian engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the 13-ton Phobos-Grunt breaks up in the atmosphere, debris could potentially fall anywhere along a vast stretch of the Earth's surface that includes the cities of New York, London and Tokyo. Though the odds are heavily against the debris causing any harm, the spectacle of people around the world anticipating the crash is another embarrassment for Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, which has presided over a series of rocket and satellite failures this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement from the United States Strategic Command acknowledged that it was tracking the space probe and that it is likely to fall in the next week. ''Predictions of re-entry date, time and location can change significantly due to many changing factors, such as solar weather and orientation of the spacecraft,'' the statement said. ''These predictions become more accurate as the event approaches.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Phobos-Grunt first went awry, the director of the Russian space agency, Vladimir Popovkin, said that a flawed navigational computer might be to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said that they helped Roscosmos, using NASA's antennas known as the Deep Space Network, to try to re-establish contact with Phobos-Grunt, and that NASA had continued these efforts until the antennas were needed for the launch of its Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft on Nov. 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin's remarks to the newspaper Izvestia were the first high-level suggestion of nefarious interference. A retired commander of Russia's missile warning system had speculated in November that strong radar signals from installations in Alaska might have damaged the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want to accuse anybody, but there are very powerful devices that can influence spacecraft now,'' Mr. Popovkin said in the interview. ''The possibility they were used cannot be ruled out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin also suggested that equipment on the spacecraft may have broken down while the vehicle was stored on the ground, waiting for the time when Earth and Mars would be in the right places in their orbits for the mission to proceed, something that happens only every two years. ''If we had not sent it to Mars in 2011, we would have had to throw it away,'' he said of the craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interview came at a time of rising anti-Americanism in Russian politics, and may have been intended mostly for a domestic audience. Russian officials often drop hints of foreign meddling, for example in stirring the recent street protests in Moscow; such comments are usually taken to mean the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin's remarks stood out in stark contrast to the cooperative spirit of recent Russian civilian space endeavors carried out in partnership with NASA, the European Space Agency and other foreign partners. Though Russia maintains a military wing of its space program, confrontation and even competition with the United States in space largely vanished with the end of the cold war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two powers called the space race a tie and agreed to build the International Space Station together; now that the American space shuttles are retired, NASA astronauts fly to the station aboard Russian rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Popovkin did not directly implicate the United States in the interview. But he said ''the frequent failure of our space launches, which occur at a time when they are flying over the part of Earth not visible from Russia, where we do not see the spacecraft and do not receive telemetric information, are not clear to us,'' an apparent reference to the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has not succeeded in sending a spacecraft to Mars since the 1980s. An attempt in 1996 to launch a Mars lander that could burrow below the planet's surface failed because of a flaw in the rocket that carried it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phobos-Grunt, which took about five years to build and cost $160 million at current exchange rates, was launched from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan on Nov. 9; it also carried a small Chinese Mars orbiter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history registry for New Mexico lists the same items.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might be surprising, since Tranquillity Base is not in New Mexico or California but a quarter of a million miles away, in the spot where Neil A. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for archaeologists and historians worried that the next generation of people visiting the moon might carelessly obliterate the site of one of humanity's greatest accomplishments, these designations were important first steps toward raising awareness of the need to protect off-world artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's humanity's heritage,'' said Beth L. O'Leary, a professor of anthropology at New Mexico State University. ''It's just an incredible realm that archaeologists haven't begun to look at until now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. O'Leary herself had not given much thought to historic preservation on the Moon until a student asked her in 1999 whether federal preservation laws applied to the Apollo landing sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That started the ball rolling,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out to be a tricky question. Under international law, the United States government still owns everything it left on the moon: the bottom half of the first lunar lander, the scientific experiments, the urine bags. But 100 nations, including the United States, have signed the Outer Space Treaty, in which they agree not to claim sovereignty over any part of the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the last decade, the effort by Dr. O'Leary and her students to seek formal protection for the Apollo sites was a lonely pursuit. NASA, by its nature, looks more to its future than its past. ''There's a tendency of NASA, when their programs end, they tend to get rid of everything,'' said Milford Wayne Donaldson, the historic preservation officer for California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials were also wary that other countries would see granting historic protection to the Apollo sites as a ruse by the United States to put down territorial claims. And with no plans to go back to the moon, it all seemed like an academic exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But interest in the moon has perked up again. Russia and India plan to send robotic landers. NASA was going to send astronauts back there until the Obama administration changed course a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most crucially, the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, a competition among 26 teams to become the first private organization to put a spacecraft on the moon, offered a $1 million bonus for visiting a historic site there. At least one team announced it was heading for Tranquillity Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, the prospect of a new little rover's rolling over Neil Armstrong's footprints was not entirely farfetched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Dr. O'Leary started placing calls to historic preservation officials in states where the space industry looms large. Texas, she learned, couldn't help her, because to be listed as a historic resource there, an item must lie in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2009, she called Mr. Donaldson in Sacramento to recruit his help in protecting American relics on the moon, ''which I thought was an incredible, great idea right off the bat,'' he said. Dr. O'Leary and her students had already tried to get the National Park Service to list the base as a national historic landmark, but ''they had been turned down flatly,'' Mr. Donaldson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he checked California's laws, he found that artifacts just had to have an association with the state to be listed. The Apollo program qualified, and the Historical Resources Commission approved the listing in January 2010. New Mexico followed three months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA became interested, too. Robert Kelso, manager of lunar commercial services at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he had talked with top officials at the agency: ''We said if they're serious about going, we ought to get some of our best and brightest together and begin looking at this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA held a workshop a year ago about the preservation issue. Then Mr. Kelso led a team that cataloged what was left on the moon after the six Apollo landings, and it recommended how to balance historic preservation with the likely desire in the future to investigate how well the materials have lasted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recommendations, issued in the fall, place greater protections on items from the first moon mission, Apollo 11, and the last one, Apollo 17. For Apollo 11, the recommendations ask that any visitor, robotic or human, stay at least 75 meters from the lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In that case, it would protect every footprint from Neil and Buzz and all the flight hardware,'' Mr. Kelso said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Apollo 17, the protection bubble is even wider -- 225 meters -- because a lunar buggy let the last two men on the moon, Eugene A. Cernan and Harrison H. Schmitt, cover much more ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't protect every rover track and footprint,'' Mr. Kelso said, ''but we protected a lot of them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recommendation for the other landing sites is that visitors can get close but not touch anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelso's team also suggested guidelines for the paths of spacecraft overhead, to limit the chance that rocket exhaust will blow around lunar dust and damage the footprints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelso said NASA's recommendations, like the listings by California and New Mexico, have no legal force. ''We are hoping that whether it's an international team or a commercial team, they would honor and recognize the value of these sites and honor these recommendations,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a sea change for NASA to come out with recommendations,'' Dr. O'Leary said. ''I think that the guidance you provide certainly strengthens the moral sanctions against obliterating some part of the archaeological record.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lunar X Prize team that declared that it was going to Tranquillity Base, run by a company called Astrobotic Technology, now says it will stay away from the Apollo 11 and 17 sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donaldson would like to add Tranquillity Base to the United Nations' list of world heritage sites. But first he will have to get the rules changed. Currently, nations can nominate only sites that are ''on their territory.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To go to outer space, Catherine Culver went to a travel agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first flights of the new airlines that will take tourists past the threshold of space are poised to take off in 2012, and getting a seat on one is not all that different from booking a trip someplace on Earth. You can sign up on the Web site of, say, Virgin Galactic, the most prominent of the new space tourism companies, or go to a travel agent and put down a hefty deposit. Soon you will be able to buy travel insurance, just as you can for any other vacation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, space tourism has been limited to the ultrawealthy: just seven people have paid tens of millions of dollars each for a trip to the International Space Station aboard a Russian rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could change this year, when Virgin Galactic intends to start offering flights just beyond the space barrier on a rocket ship it has built, featuring five minutes of weightlessness during a two-and-a-half hour jaunt. At $200,000 a seat, this will open the final frontier to far more people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hopefully by next Christmas, myself, my daughter and my son will be the first people to go up into space'' on a commercial craft, Richard Branson, the owner of Virgin Galactic, said in a videotaped interview in November (with a touch of his signature grandiosity).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least two other specialty airlines have jumped in as well, taking reservations (and deposits) for future space flights. Allianz, the big insurer, will introduce an insurance product in 2012, lending space tourism the trappings of the regular travel industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just to be able to sell space travel as a regular part of your business, really, just how cool is that?'' said Lynda Turley Garrett, president of Alpine Travel of Saratoga, Calif., who is one of 58 accredited space agents for Virgin Galactic in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In five years, Ms. Garrett has sold three seats, including Ms. Culver's. But she expects that to change once passengers start going up and coming down to tell their friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2017, ''it'll be just like scheduling a flight to L.A.,'' Ms. Garrett predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Culver, who has worked as a mission controller at NASA and now gives motivational talks, has always wanted to go to space; she applied four times to become a NASA astronaut, with no luck. To book her spaceflight, she wanted a face-to-face conversation, so she looked through the list of Virgin's space agents and was pleased to find one near her home in San Jose, Calif. She and Ms. Garrett spent some time chatting, then went to lunch and chatted more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon afterward, Ms. Culver put down her $20,000 deposit, becoming one of 475 people who have reserved a place on a Virgin Galactic flight. Most of them have already paid the full ticket price to rise above the 62-mile mark, which is considered the entrance to outer space. (People who pay in full will get the first seats.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These flights will not orbit the Earth. Rather, they will be up-and-down ''suborbital'' jaunts more akin to a giant roller coaster ride, offering about five minutes of weightlessness at the acme of the flight. The trip is not for the faint of stomach: NASA used to train astronauts on a fast-diving airplane that offered intervals of weightlessness and was nicknamed the Vomit Comet -- apparently for good reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Virgin's customers, the ride to space will culminate a three-day trip to the newly built Spaceport America in Las Cruces, N.M. Part of the time will be spent on training and preparations. Part of it will be fun on the ground. ''Typical Virgin, there'll be parties going on,'' Ms. Garrett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the third day, a carrier airplane with the SpaceShipTwo rocket ship slung underneath will take off from the runway and fly to 50,000 feet, where the rocket ship will be launched. At that point, the force of acceleration will press passengers deep into their chairs -- someone who weighs 170 pounds will feel like half a ton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the roar of the engine will fade to silence, the blue sky will fade to black, and weight will turn to weightlessness. ''You'll be able to unbuckle, move about the cabin, do somersaults, get your picture taken with the Earth's curvature in the background,'' Ms. Garrett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, the passengers will strap back into their seats before SpaceShipTwo re-enters the atmosphere, exerting another few minutes of crushing force. Once it has slowed, it will glide back to the runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Culver, the Virgin flight will fulfill a dream, albeit an expensive one. ''In California, it would be similar to buying a house,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronaut dreams could reach the grasp of even more people if prices drop. In addition to Mr. Branson, the entrepreneurs who have introduced space ventures include Elon Musk of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and, more recently, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> founder, and Paul G. Allen, a <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder. The companies are primarily focused on carrying satellites to orbit and winning NASA contracts, but they have indicated that passenger trips may eventually be part of the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic is not the only one with paying customers. <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> of Mojave, Calif., has more than 100 reservations for a $95,000 seat on its small space plane, which will have just two seats -- one for the pilot and one for the passenger. XCOR could begin flying as soon as 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And <span class="companylink">Space Adventures Ltd</span>. of Vienna, Va., which has been taking reservations for a while at $110,000 a seat, has signed up more than 200 people. Its partner, Armadillo Aerospace of Heath, Tex., plans to build an automated spacecraft -- no pilot -- that can take up two people at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Space Adventures customer who paid his deposit more than a decade ago is Madsen Pirie, a British researcher who founded the Adam Smith Institute, which is dedicated to free-market policy. ''I was the first person in Britain to sign up,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is disappointed that the wait has stretched out -- Space Adventures has yet to set a target date for its suborbital flights -- but he has no regrets. ''It has been a story of postponed hopes,'' Mr. Pirie said. ''I shall be hugely delighted when my turn comes around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that things are speeding up, Allianz, which has a $1-billion-a-year travel insurance business, announced recently that it would offer insurance to Virgin Galactic customers to cover a range of possible problems, including last-minute cancellations and coverage for medical issues before or after the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the question of whether to offer space travel insurance first came up three or four years ago, ''we said it was a joke at that time,'' recalled Erick Morazin, global accounts director at <span class="companylink">Allianz Global Assistance</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Virgin Galactic, XCOR and Space Adventures refund almost all of the deposit if someone wants to cancel, but Mr. Morazin said he expected their policies to become less forgiving in the future. ''We will be prepared for this milestone,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- Broadening its challenge to the United States, the Chinese government on Thursday announced an ambitious five-year plan for space exploration that would move China closer to becoming a major rival at a time when the American program is in retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with China's earlier vows to build a space station and put an astronaut on the moon, the plan conjured up memories of the cold-war-era space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States, which has de-emphasized manned spaceflight in recent years, is now dependent on Russia for transporting its astronauts to the International Space Station. Russia, for its part, has suffered an embarrassing string of failed satellite launchings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has been looking for ways to exert its growing economic strength and to demonstrate that its technological mastery and scientific achievements can approach those of any global power. The plan announced Thursday calls for launching a space lab and collecting samples from the moon, all by 2016, along with a more powerful manned spaceship and space freighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, China has also sought to build a military capacity in keeping with its economic might, expanding its submarine fleet and, this year, testing its first aircraft carrier, a refurbished Soviet model. Under the new space plan, it would vastly expand its version of a Global Positioning System, which would have military as well as civilian uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan shows how the government intends to draw on military and civilian resources to meet the goals, which the government is betting will also produce benefits for the Chinese economy. ''This approach offers lessons for other advanced space powers, including the U.S., which needs to make sure it sustains its high-level investment in various aspects of space development across the board,'' said Andrew S. Erickson, a professor at the United States Naval War College who has studied the Chinese space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a leader in the business of launching satellites, China is still years behind the United States in space. Its human spaceflight accomplishments to date put it roughly where the United States and the Soviet Union were in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But China has consistently stuck to a development timeline for its program and met the realistic goals set out in its five-year plans, which are mainstays of the Communist Party's authoritarian system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For human spaceflight, the plan lays out a continuation of China's steady but unrushed efforts to develop technologies and extend its capacities. It says that China will begin the work to land its astronauts on the moon, but it does not provide a target date for when they will go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is a comprehensive, moderately paced program,'' said John M. Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''It's not a crash program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, NASA's direction tends to shift with every change of presidency. President George W. Bush called on NASA to return to the moon by 2020. President Obama canceled that program and now wants the agency to send astronauts to an asteroid. NASA shut down its 30-year space shuttle program after a final flight in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The one thing that is admirable about their program is they don't have fits and starts,'' said Joseph R. Fragola, a space safety expert who has visited the space facilities in China. ''Their program is low budget but it is laid out, and they follow it in an orderly process, and we don't do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say Beijing is approaching its space program the way it did its military modernization. In addition to the aircraft carrier, which it bought from Ukraine, China has also made a progress on an anti-ship ballistic missile, which could be deployed to ward off foreign warships. Last January, the Chinese military tested a stealth fighter hours before Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary at the time, met in Beijing with President Hu Jintao.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in the United States, where there are separate military and civilian space programs, in China the People's Liberation Army is the driving force behind development of the Chinese space program. Civilian institutions, including various universities and laboratories, are part of the military-led efforts. In the white paper that laid out the plan, released by the State Council, China's cabinet, the authors took pains to say that Beijing was not seeking to challenge any nation militarily with its space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''China always adheres to the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes weaponization or any arms race in outer space,'' the paper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say one of the more notable goals of the five-year strategy is to further develop the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, which on Tuesday began providing navigation, positioning and timing data on China and surrounding areas. The white paper said China intended to have a global system by 2020, with 35 satellites in orbit. If it met that goal, China would join Russia in having a system that tries to rival America's. China has already launched 10 satellites for the Beidou system, and plans to launch six more next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beidou is not as advanced as its American counterpart, but it is expected to overshadow the Russian system and would provide the Chinese military with an alternative to relying on a civilian version of the American network. Beidou would also be used for civilian purposes, like providing drivers with a navigation tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has major commercial implications, it has major security implications,'' Mr. Erickson said. ''To be a great military and space power, it's important to have one's own satellite navigation system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The white paper, which follows similar reports released in 2000 and 2006, also said China would develop new Long March launch vehicles to deliver heavier payloads into orbit. It will also work on improving conditions for human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To lay that groundwork, the paper said, China ''will launch space laboratories, manned spaceship and space freighters; make breakthroughs in and master space station key technologies, including astronauts' medium-term stay, regenerative life support and propellant refueling; conduct space applications to a certain extent and make technological preparations for the construction of space stations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On deep-space exploration, the paper said China planned to launch orbiters that would make soft lunar landings and do roving and surveying. After that, the paper said, China will collect samples of the moon's surface and bring them back for analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper also said China planned to carry out a comprehensive plan for upgrading its satellite technology and widening the uses of its satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In aggregate, this is clearly going to propel China even further into space to a significant degree,'' Mr. Erickson said. ''There's relentless progress across the board.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, China became the third country to send a human into space, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, when it put Yang Liwei into orbit around the earth. It launched a lunar probe in 2007 that orbited the moon and took pictures, and the next year completed its first spacewalk when Zhai Zhigang remained for 13 minutes outside the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Long March 5 rocket, currently under development, would be able to lift about 25 tons to low-earth orbit, comparable to the United States' Delta IV Heavy rocket and much smaller than the Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo spacecraft to the moon four decades ago. But that would be enough for China to get to the moon by launching its lunar spacecraft in pieces and assembling it in the earth's orbit.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what amounts to a kind of holiday gift to the cosmos, astronomers from NASA's Kepler spacecraft announced Tuesday that they had discovered a pair of planets the size of Earth orbiting a distant star. The new planets, one about as big as Earth and the other slightly smaller than Venus, are the smallest yet found beyond the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the discovery showed that Kepler could indeed find planets as small as our own and was an encouraging sign that planet hunters would someday succeed in the goal of finding Earth-like abodes in the heavens.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first Jupiter-size exoplanets, as they are known, were discovered nearly 15 years ago, astronomers have been chipping away at the sky, finding smaller and smaller planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are finally there,'' said David Charbonneau, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was a member of the team that made the observations, led by his colleague Francois Fressin. The team reported its results in an online news conference Tuesday and in a paper being published in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fressin said, ''This demonstrates for the first time that Earth-size planets exist around other stars and that we can detect them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement doubled the number of known Earth-size planets in the galaxy to four from two -- Earth and Venus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next major goal in the planetary hunt, astronomers say, is to find an Earth-size planet in the so-called Goldilocks zone of a star, where conditions are temperate for water and thus life. We are not there yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two new planets, Kepler 20e and Kepler 20f, are far outside the Goldilocks zone -- so close to the star, termed Kepler 20, that one of them is roasting at up to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit -- and thus unlivable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the milestone of an Earth-size planet had long been anticipated, astronomers on and off the Kepler team were jubilant. Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, another Kepler team member, called the new result ''a watershed moment in human history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Fischer, a planet hunter from Yale, who was not part of the team, said, ''This technological feat is incredibly important because it means that the detection of Earth-size planets at larger distances is technically possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 20e, the closer and hotter planet, is also the smaller -- about 6,900 miles across, or slightly smaller than Venus -- and it resides about 5 million miles from its star. The more distant planet, Kepler 20f, also broiling at around 800 degrees, is 10 million miles out from its star. It is 8,200 miles in diameter, about the size of Earth. The two planets are presumed to be rocky orbs that formed in the outskirts of their planetary system and then migrated inward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their star, which is slightly smaller and cooler than the Sun, is about 950 light years away from us. Kepler had previously found three larger Neptune-like planets around it, so the new observations bring the total to five so far. All the planets are well inside where Mercury would be in our own solar system, presenting a bounteous system of unlivable planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is Venus and Earth in a five-planet system,'' Dr. Fischer said in an e-mail. ''There's no place like home, and the Kepler data are starting to uncover some mighty familiar architectures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler detects planets by watching for blinks when they move in front of their stars. Since it was launched in 2009, it has found 2,326 potential planets, 207 that would be Earth-size, if confirmed as the two reported Tuesday have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmation of a planet, however, requires additional observations, usually of its star's wobbles as it gets tugged by the planet going around. The gravitational pull of planets as small as the Earth on their parent star is too small to measure with the current spectrographs. And so the astronomers resorted to a statistical method called Blender, developed by Dr. Fressin and Guillermo Torres of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, in which millions of computer simulations of background stars try to mimic the Kepler signal. They concluded that Kepler 20e was 3,400 times more likely to be a planet than background noise, while the odds in favor Kepler 20f being real were 1,370 to 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmed (or validated, as the Kepler team likes to say), they join the other planets already known to orbit the star. In a surprise for astronomers who thought they knew how planetary systems form, the orbits of the new planets are sandwiched between the orbits of the older, bigger, gassier ones, a configuration that does not occur in our own solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail, Dr. Charbonneau noted: ''In the solar system, rocky worlds and gas giants don't mingle. But in the Kepler 20 system they apparently do.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, I get it - I understand it - but I fail to see the appeal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do think I've found an exception though; it's called Solar Walk, and it's a $3 astronomy app for iOS devices that can work in concert with 3-D televisions. More on that in a minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outer space was a big deal to me when I was growing up. I lived a few blocks from a planetarium. And once I was old enough to head out and do stuff on my own, I pretty much spent my time there (I know - sexy), head pointed ceilingwards as I took in yet another space show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My planetarium got rebuilt years ago and is now way too high-tech and shiny for me to properly enjoy (I like my planetariums like I like my episodes of ''Breaking Bad'' - as dark as possible).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, Solar Walk, designed by the same people who created the stargazing app Star Walk, nails this pitch-black aesthetic, right down to the mystical Kitaro/Vangelis-sounding soundtrack that plays in the background while you pinch and swipe your way through the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet's moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When viewing Earth, you can also check the position of 10 satellites. Zoom in on one and you can pull up more information about the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope or less-famous craft like the Koronas-Foton satellite from Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar Walk also lets you watch short movies about celestial and terrestrial activity. The commuter train may not be a sky theater, but you can still use that time to learn about things like tidal phenomena and the relative sizes of the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.K, so what does all this have to do with 3-D TVs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar Walk supports Apple's AirPlay mirroring feature, which allows you (if you have an iPad 2 or an iPhone 4S) to stream exactly what you're looking at on your device to an Apple TV-equipped television. Now you're not looking at the rings of Saturn on a 3.5- or 10-inch screen, but on serious double-digit real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you happen to own a 3-D TV, you can set the app to send a 3-D image to your display (this also works on iOS devices themselves) and, with the requisite 3-D glasses, watch satellites and moons whip around in front of you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is viewing an iOS astronomy app while wearing 3-D goggles the height of dorkiness? Oh, absolutely. It's also one of the most fun things you can do this side of a Carl Zeiss Mark IX Universarium (gotta know your large-dome planetarium projectors, yo). And where the Zeiss costs north of $3 million, Solar Walk can give you a similar experience for three bucks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he is going to use it to launch rockets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul G. Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, said Tuesday that he was entering the rocket business with a concept seldom used until now: a plane that can take off the conventional way and then, at 30,000 feet, launch a rocket to orbit, carrying with it satellites, supplies and -- eventually -- people. The first rocket launching could be as soon as 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have a certain number of dreams in your life that you want to fulfill,'' said Mr. Allen, an avid philanthropist who has also financed efforts like a radio telescope listening for alien transmissions, ''and this is a dream that I'm very excited about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airplane that his new company, Stratolaunch Systems, plans to build will be larger and heavier than the Spruce Goose, Howard Hughes's record-setting flying boat that flew, just once, in 1947. With wings that will stretch 385 feet -- longer than a football field -- it will dwarf the double-decker Airbus A380, which is the biggest commercial passenger plane flown today. It will take off from a runway, fly to a normal cruising altitude and then drop off a rocket, eliminating the need for costly launching pads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With government-funded spaceflight diminishing, there is a much expanded opportunity for privately funded efforts,'' Mr. Allen said. He noted that NASA had ended its space shuttle program this year, scrapped plans to return to the Moon and begun relying solely on Russia for launching astronauts to the International Space Station. He said his new effort would help keep ''keep America at the forefront of space exploration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen thus joins the ranks of tycoons who are placing big bets on the heavens. The most prominent is Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic subsidiary is planning to fly tourists on short jaunts to the edge of space. Other big names are Elon Musk, who used his fortune as a founder of Paypal to establish <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a rocket maker that is racking up contracts with NASA, and Jeffrey P. Bezos, the <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> founder, who has a space company called Blue Origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen was actually at the forefront of the billionaire space enthusiasts. A decade ago, he and Burt Rutan, a legendary aerospace engineer who, among many triumphs, built the first airplane to fly around the world without stopping or refueling, teamed up to create SpaceShipOne, the first private manned rocket to reach space, in 2004. That won the $10 million Ansari X Prize, which had been offered as an incentive to push innovative space technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But afterward, Mr. Allen receded from the space limelight as Mr. Rutan worked on a larger version of SpaceShipOne for Mr. Branson's Virgin Galactic, which will launch out of a newly built spaceport in New Mexico, maybe by late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Volume space tourism, I'd leave it to someone like Richard who knew how to pull that off,'' Mr. Allen said. ''To me, the exciting thing would be go all the way to orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new project draws in a mixture of space industry people, old and new. Mr. Musk's company -- the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- will build the rockets that Stratolaunch plans to launch. Michael D. Griffin, a former NASA administrator who has been supportive but skeptical of the emerging commercial space industry, will be on Stratolaunch's board of directors. Stratolaunch will have headquarters in Huntsville, Ala., which is known as ''the Rocket City'' because of its role in the history of spaceflight, and an aircraft hangar in Mojave, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen is the sole investor, putting only his own money at risk. He declined to say how much he planned to spend. ''Obviously, this is not inexpensive,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new company aims to use the same strategy that won the X Prize, and supersize it. For the X Prize, he and Mr. Rutan took a rocket called SpaceShipOne, slung beneath a carrier airplane, and lofted it high into the sky before launching it, with a pilot on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, the carrier airplane will have six 747 engines and a gross weight of more than 1.2 million pounds. It will use a 12,000-foot runway. By getting rid of the specialized launching pads used by NASA and other space agencies, Stratolaunch officials say they will be able to reduce costs, offer more flexibility and avoid bad weather by simply flying their airborne launcher to a patch of clear sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that Mr. Rutan founded, Scaled Composites, will build the airplane. Mr. Rutan, who retired this year, did the preliminary designs and will act as an adviser, but current Scaled employees will perform most of the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rutan said that Scaled Composites, which is tiny compared with companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Airbus, will able to build such a huge airplane because it is designing and building only the airframe. Other components like the engines, electronics and landing gear will be scavenged from second-hand 747s. ''The things that are most difficult, we're not developing,'' he said. ''We're just bolting them in as things that have millions of hours of airline service.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a tiny space plane like SpaceShipOne, Stratolaunch's carrier airplane will cradle a full-size rocket, a variant of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9, weighing about half a million pounds. The plane will take the rocket to 30,000 feet, almost six miles high, and then drop it. The rocket's engines will then ignite and the tail fins will turn the rocket's direction upward. The airplane will return to the airport and, in a quick turnaround, could be ready to launch another rocket by the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payload capacity will be about 13,500 pounds to low-Earth orbit -- less than the Falcon 9 and other larger rockets like the Atlas V and Delta IV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Stratolaunch will aim to carry smaller satellites like NASA science probes. ''This is obviously a big initial investment,'' Mr. Allen said, ''that we wouldn't be making if we didn't think they were going to be a lot customers out there, both for cargo and manned missions in the future.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers announced Monday that they had taken E.T. off hold and resumed searching for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations with a set of radio telescopes in Hat Creek, Calif. The project, part of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, was suspended in April when the University of California's Hat Creek Observatory ran out of money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers from the SETI Institute had been using an innovative set of radio telescopes known as the Allen Telescope Array to try to listen in on alien broadcasts from the raft of planets newly found by NASA's Kepler satellite. Under a new deal -- as well as a public fund-raising effort that netted $200,000 -- the SETI astronomers will share the telescopes with the Air Force, which is interested in using them to track satellites and space junk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 6:18 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Monday, when the stars in Kepler's field of view rose in Hat Creek, the array was back on the job, looking for what Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute here called ''technosignatures'' of any inhabitants of those planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know there are planets there,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SETI's resurrection was announced at the start of a weeklong conference here devoted to results from the Kepler satellite, which is conducting a cosmic Gallup poll to determine the fraction of stars that harbor habitable, Earth-like planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overflow crowd of more than 500 astronomers signed up, and they got their money's worth in the first hour: William Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, reported that Kepler had confirmed its first ''Goldilocks'' planet, one that orbits its star in the so-called habitable zone -- the right distance from its star to have liquid water on its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 22b, as it is known, is 2.4 times the size of the Earth and about 600 light years from here. It takes 290 days to orbit its star, which is slightly smaller and dimmer than the Sun. Mr. Borucki said that if it had a reasonable atmosphere, the surface temperature on 22b would be about 72 degrees Fahrenheit, ''a very pleasant temperature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whether Kepler 22b is actually habitable depends on its composition and atmosphere, neither of which is known. Kepler finds planets by detecting starblinks when planets pass in front of their own stars; this allows astronomers to measure the sizes of the planets, relative to that of their home stars, but not their masses and thus their densities and compositions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of Kepler 22b, however, puts it in a class of planets known as super Earths, about which little is known since there is no planet in that range in our own solar system. It could be mostly rock, making it about 13 times the mass of the Earth, or it could be mostly gas, like Neptune. Probably, it is somewhere in between, said Mr. Borucki, adding, ''We have no planets like this in the solar system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did say that because there could be water there, Kepler 22b was a good target for SETI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bounty hardly stops there. Natalie Batalha, Kepler's deputy science team leader and a professor at San Jose State University, unleashed an avalanche of new planet candidates, bringing Kepler's potential bounty to 2,326 exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system. Among them, she said, are 207 objects that are about the size of the Earth and 680 others up to 10 times the size of Earth, or super Earths. In all, 48 of the putative planets are in the Goldilocks zone, Dr. Batalha said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so there are plenty of targets for the re-energized Allen Array, named for Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who paid for the array of 42 telescopes. Dr. Tarter said that the SETI effort needed about $100,000 a month to keep operating and that in the long run, the Air Force money would not be enough to keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are going to need public support,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are reporting that they have taken the measure of the biggest, baddest black holes yet found in the universe, abyssal yawns 10 times the size of our solar system into which billions of Suns have vanished like a guilty thought.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such holes, they say, might be the gravitational cornerstones of galaxies and clues to the fates of violent quasars, the almost supernaturally powerful explosions in the hearts of young galaxies that dominated the early years of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of these newly surveyed monsters, which weighs as much as 21 billion Suns, is in an egg-shaped swirl of stars known as NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in a sprawling cloud of thousands of galaxies about 336 million light-years away in the Coma constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other black hole, a graveyard for the equivalent of 9.7 billion Suns, more or less, lurks in the center of NGC 3842, a galaxy that anchors another cluster known as Abell 1367, about 331 million light-years away in Leo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are the most massive reliably measured black holes ever,'' Nicholas J. McConnell, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail, referring to the new observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These results are more than just cool and record-setting. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope over the years have shown that such monster black holes seem to inhabit the centers of all galaxies -- the bigger the galaxy, the bigger the black hole. Researchers said the new work could shed light on the role these black holes play in the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous record-holder was in the galaxy M87, a member of the Virgo cluster some 54 million light-years from here, where a black hole weighed in at a mere 6.3 billion solar masses. The new black holes, however, were even larger than astronomers had predicted based on the earlier measurements, suggesting that there is something special about how the most massive galaxies are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Measurements of these massive black holes will help us understand how their host galaxies were assembled, and how the holes achieved such monstrous mass,'' Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell and his thesis adviser, Chung-Pei Ma, led a team of astronomers who used telescopes in Hawaii, Texas and outer space to weigh the black holes in the centers of galaxies by clocking the speeds of stars zooming around them; the faster the stars are going, the more gravity -- and thus mass -- is needed to keep the stars from flying away. They report their work in the journal Nature, which will be published online on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Rees, a cosmologist at Cambridge University, called the new work ''an incremental step,'' noting that the study of these monsters has been a part of his life for a long time. ''It's good to learn about even bigger ones,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black holes, regions of space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from it, are among the weirdest of the predictions of Albert Einstein's curved-space theory of gravity, general relativity -- so weird that Einstein himself did not believe it. He once wrote to a friend that there ought to be a law of nature forbidding such a thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was wrong. And some of his successors, like Dr. Rees and a colleague at Cambridge, Stephen Hawking, have spent their careers studying the implications for physics of objects that can wrap spacetime around themselves like a magician's cloak and disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is the fate, astronomers agree, of some massive stars once they run out of fuel and collapse upon themselves. Indeed the galaxy is littered with stellar-mass black holes detectable by the X-rays spit by doomed matter swirling around them like water in a drain. And there seem to be giant ones in the heart of every galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One question astronomers would like answered is how these black holes got so big, billions of times bigger than a typical dead star. Dr. Ma described it as a kind of nature-versus-nurture argument, explaining that black holes could grow by merging with other black holes as galaxies merge to get bigger -- ''nature'' -- or by swallowing gas around them -- ''nurture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bit like asking: Are taller children produced by taller parents or by eating a lot of spinach?'' Dr. Ma wrote in an e-mail. ''For black holes we are not sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also think the supermassive black holes in galaxies could be the missing link between the early universe and today. In the early days of the universe, quasars, thought to be powered by giant black holes in cataclysmic feeding frenzies, were fountaining energy into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where are those quasars now? The new work supports a growing suspicion that those formerly boisterous black holes are among us now, but, having stopped their boisterous growth, are sleeping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell said, ''Our discovery of extremely massive black holes in the largest present-day galaxies suggests that these galaxies could be the ancient remains of voracious ancestors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's try not to awaken them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least four times in the last few years, astronomers have announced they have found planets orbiting other stars in the sweet spot known as the habitable zone -- not too hot, not too cold -- where water and thus perhaps life are possible. In short, a so-called Goldilocks planet fit to be inhabited by the biochemical likes of us.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these claims are without controversy, but astronomers who are making discoveries with NASA's Kepler spacecraft are meeting next week in California to review the first two years of their quest, which seems tantalizingly close to hitting pay dirt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sooner or later, Kepler will find a lukewarm planet with a size making it probably Earthlike,'' said Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, who spends his time tracking down candidates identified by Kepler. ''We're no more than a year away'' from such a discovery, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planetary astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it this way: ''We are on the verge of being those people who will be remembered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this has brought to the fore a question long debated by geologists, chemists, paleontologists and cosmologists turned astrobiologists, namely: What does life really need to get going, flourish and evolve on some alien rock?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer depends of course on whom we expect to be living there. We might dream of green men with big eyes, ants with hive minds, or even cuddly octopuses as an antidote to cosmic loneliness, but what we are most likely to find, a growing number of scientists say, is alien pond slime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microbes can spring up anywhere that is wet and warm, astronomers say, although biologists are not so sanguine. But the emergence of large creatures, let alone intelligent ones, as evidenced by the history of the Earth, depends on a chain of events and accidents -- from asteroid strikes to plate tectonics -- that are unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. ''If you reran Earth's history, how many times would you get animals?'' asked Donald Brownlee, an astronomer at the University of Washington. He and a colleague, the paleontologist Peter Ward, made a case that we live on a lucky planet in their 1999 book, ''Rare Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-cell life might be common, given the right simple conditions, explained Dr. Marcy in an e-mail. ''But the steady, long-term evolution toward critters that play improv saxophone, write alliteration poems, and build heavy-lifting rocket boosters may depend on a prohibitive list of planetary prerequisites,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even warm and wet is a rare condition, however, occurring now on only one of the eight official planets in our solar system and three of the several dozen moons. Mars was once wet, but it is now a desert. And after billions of dollars spent exploring Mars and the remains of space probes littering the planet, we still do not know if a single microbe ever lived there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody really knows how rare or common are planets like Earth and its brand of life. ''I would be more comfortable with that argument if it were not so Earth-o-centric,'' Steven Benner, a chemist at the Foundation for Molecular Evolution, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, he said, low-temperature water mixed with ammonia can substitute for water alone as the liquid necessary for life. So could liquid methane, which forms lakes on Titan, Saturn's slushy frigid moon, and Dr. Benner and others have advocated looking for life there. ''We are limited by our imaginations,'' said Natalie Batalha, a leader of the Kepler team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists deplore the emphasis on animals like us, saying it is hopelessly parochial and unimaginative -- the scientific equivalent of the drunk searching for his car keys under a street light because that's where the light is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Animals are overgrown microbes,'' said Paul Falkowski, a biophysicist and biologist from Rutgers. ''We are here to ferry microbes across the planet. Plants and animals are an afterthought of microbes.'' So, we should hardly be disappointed if we find our neighbors are microbes. After all, on Earth, microbes were the whole story for almost four billion years, paleontologists say, and now inhabit our intestines as well as every doorknob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov, an astronomer turned astrobiologist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said he was all for the existence of a microbial planet. ''Don't assume microbes are simple,'' he said, noting that 99 percent of the genes in our bodies belong to microbes inhabiting us and without which we could not live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for Goldilocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blue-ribbon committee of chemists convened by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there was only one ironclad requirement for life, besides energy: a place warm enough for chemical reactions to go on. So, determining how warm a planet's atmosphere keeps it -- through assumptions, calculations or just plain guesses -- has been crucial in reaching a verdict about its potential habitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how it has gone with the potential Goldilocks planets orbiting Gliese 581, a small cool red star about 20 light-years from here in the constellation Libra that has been at the center of exoplanet fantasies and speculation for the last few years. Depending on whom you talk to, it has five or six planets, three of which have at one time or another been claimed to be habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first in what would become a chain of potential Goldilocks planets, identified in 2007, was a presumably rocky ball about five times as massive as the Earth and orbiting only about seven million miles from Gliese 581, close enough within the small star's shrunken habitable zone to have a warm surface. ''On the treasure map of the universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X,'' Xavier Delfosse, one of the astronomers who discovered it, said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before budding interstellar explorers could even begin conceiving of booking passage to Gliese 581c, as the planet is poetically called, other astronomers took a closer look and concluded that if the planet's geology and atmosphere resembled those of Earth, it would be a stifling greenhouse, no place to set solar sail for. Attention then shifted to a farther planet in the system, Gliese 581d, which had been dismissed as too cold. Could the same greenhouse effect that would torch the inner planet thaw the outer one and make it livable? The answer was yes, but only if it had ''loads of carbon dioxide'' and an atmosphere seven times thicker than Earth's, said Lisa Kaltenegger, a climate modeler at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. Otherwise it would be freezing cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile yet another planet was claimed for that system, smack between the other two, by a team led by R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution and Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz. ''This is really the first Goldilocks planet,'' Dr. Butler said at a news conference last year organized by the National Science Foundation in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Geneva team that had discovered the earlier Gliese 581 planets could not find any evidence of the new planet's existence in their own data. For now, anyway, most astronomers have dismissed that planet. Pending the publication of new results by the Geneva team -- one of the most prolific in the planet-hunting business -- Dr. Butler said, ''We are in a holding pattern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, what some astronomers called the best and smallest Goldilocks candidate yet was announced by the Geneva team. About 3.6 times as massive as the Earth, it circles a faint orange star in Vela known as HD 85512 at a distance of some 24 million miles, about a quarter of the Earth's distance from the Sun. Dr. Kaltenegger and her colleagues calculated that this planet would be habitable if it had an Earth-type geology and at least 50 percent cloud cover. ''So, so far we only have two great targets to search for atmospheric signatures of life,'' Dr. Kaltenegger wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So goes the history of astrobiology, as well as its future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, as many astronomers point out, is getting any more information about these planets. ''Astronomers are going to have to learn to live with ignorance,'' Dr. Seager said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some exoplanets, like the Gliese worlds, were discovered by the ''wobble method'' -- looking at the motions they induce in their parent stars -- which allows their masses and orbits to be measured. Other planets, like the ones identified by Kepler, are found by watching for the blinks when they pass in front of their stars; that also allows their sizes to be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, if, if</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, none of the Goldilocks candidates have been observed to transit their stars, and thus none have been assigned both masses and sizes, which would allow astronomers to calculate their densities and compositions and find out if they are water worlds, rocks or gassy fluff balls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler fixes its gaze on a patch of stars in Cygnus that are hundreds if not thousands of light-years away -- too far for any wobble detections that would assess the abundance of Earthlike planets in the galaxy or any other close scrutiny. We are liable to never know anymore about those planets than we know now, astronomers say. The brute reality, astronomers admit, is that even if there are thousands or millions of habitable planets in the galaxy, only a few hundred of them are within range of any telescope that will be built in the conceivable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily there is some renewed hope for life on those nearby planets. David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics runs a project called MEarth that looks for planets around nearby stars. He pointed out that of the 300 stars within 25 light-years of here, 260 are red dwarfs like Gliese 581.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently it was thought that habitable-zone planets around such stars would have to hug the star so closely that they would be tidally locked, like the Moon, keeping one face locked to the star and roasting, the other freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new studies have concluded that a proper atmosphere could spread the heat around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is good. ''These stars,'' Dr. Charbonneau said, ''are our only hope for studying life in the universe in the coming decades.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the original scheme of things, Kepler was to be succeeded by a space observatory called the Terrestrial Planet Finder, which would be big enough to find and study planets up to 100 light-years distant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But plans for that telescope have collapsed, because of NASA's continuing fiscal woes and disagreements among astronomers, as well as the technological challenges involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers hope that some of these functions can be performed by the James Webb Space Telescope -- NASA's Hubble successor, overdue and over budget, now scheduled for a launch in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with a ''starshade'' that would blot out the glare of a planet's sun, the Webb could detect and study the pinpoint of light from an exoplanet itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the starshade would be hostage to the same political and fiscal pressures that are threatening to decimate NASA's scientific programs. At best, scientists say, the search for life elsewhere has been postponed for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm beginning to despair that I will see it in my lifetime,'' said James Kasting of Pennsylvania State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geology Is Destiny</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth got lucky early. Fossil evidence suggests that microbial life was already inhabiting the Earth as early as 3.8 billion years ago -- only 700 million years after the planet collapsed into existence, and a geological instant after the end of a rain of comets and asteroids that brought just the right amount of precious water in the form of ice from the outer solar system to what would otherwise be a dry planet, astronomers say. ''The question of whether the Earth is unique because of its water abundance is perhaps the most interesting one in the arsenal of Rare Earth arguments,'' said Dr. Kasting, who explained that calculations showed that the planet could have easily had too much or too little water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet has remained comfortable ever since thanks to a geological feedback process, by which weather, oceans and volcanoes act as a thermostat. Known as the carbonate silicate cycle, it regulates the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it acts like a greenhouse -- trapping heat and keeping the planet temperate and mostly stable. Rain washes the gas out of the air and under the ocean; volcanoes disgorge it again from the underworld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without greenhouse gases and this cycle -- which Dr. Brownlee called ''this magic thing'' -- the Earth would have frozen into a snowball back in its early days when the Sun was only 70 percent as bright as it is now. Still, with all this magic, it took four billion years for animal life to appear on the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seeds for animal life were sown sometime in the dim past when some bacterium learned to use sunlight to split water molecules and produce oxygen and sugar -- photosynthesis, in short. The results began to kick in 2.4 billion years ago when the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere began to rise dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Oxidation Event, as it is called in geology, ''was clearly the biggest event in the history of the biosphere,'' said Dr. Ward from Washington. It culminated in what is known as the Cambrian explosion, about 550 million years ago, when multicellular creatures, that is to say, animals, appeared in sudden splendiferous profusion in the fossil record. We were off to the Darwinian races. Whatever happened to cause this flowering of species helped elevate Earth someplace special, say the Rare Earthers. Paleontologists argue about whether it could have been a spell of bad climate known as Snowball Earth, the breakup of a previous supercontinent, or something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, alien planets that have been lucky enough to be habitable in the first place might have to be lucky again. ''The big hurdle'' for other planets, said Dr. Brownlee, is to have some event or series of events to trigger their own ''Cambrian-like'' explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually though, Earth's luck will run out. As the Sun ages it will get brighter, astronomers say, increasing the weathering and washing away of carbon dioxide. At the same time, as the interior of the Earth cools, volcanic activity will gradually subside, cutting off the replenishing of the greenhouse gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A billion years from now, Dr. Brownlee said, there will not be enough carbon dioxide left to support photosynthesis, that is to say, the oxygen we breathe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so much for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even Earth, wonderful and special as it is, will only have animal life for one billion years,'' Dr. Brownlee said.</p>

Methane molecules are easily blown apart by ultraviolet light from the Sun, so any methane around must have been released recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the gas be burbling from something alive? Cows, after all, burp methane on Earth. Other creatures, including a class of micro-organisms that live without oxygen, also produce methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration could get some answers soon. On the launching pad at Cape Canaveral in Florida is a spacecraft, the Mars Science Laboratory, that is scheduled to lift off on Saturday and reach Mars next August. It will deliver an S.U.V.-size rover named Curiosity that carries an instrument that can detect methane in the air, and if it does, it will unleash new excitement about the prospect of life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Based on evidence, what we do have is, unequivocally, the conditions for the emergence of life were present on Mars -- period, end of story,'' said Michael J. Mumma, a senior scientist for NASA at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who led one of three teams that have made still-controversial claims of detecting methane in Mars's atmosphere. ''So life certainly could have arisen there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mars is smaller than Earth, it cooled faster, and it probably would have been hospitable for life earlier. That raises the intriguing possibility that pieces of Mars containing microbes were blasted into space by asteroid impacts and later landed on Earth, seeding life here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: we could all be descendants of Martians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of Martians has long fueled the imagination of Earthlings, from the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom novels to the canals Percival Lowell deluded himself into seeing through his telescope to ''War of the Worlds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other times, the pendulum swung back the other way. Mariner 4, the first space probe to whiz past Mars, in 1965, sent back pictures not of verdant forests, but of barren rocks. And NASA's two Viking landers in 1976, equipped with sophisticated life chemistry experiments, analyzed the soil and found it devoid of the organic building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars, it appeared in 1976, was really most sincerely dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things looked so grim for exobiology on Mars,'' said Christopher F. Chyba, a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University. ''We made this tremendous investment in two Viking landers. There was a backlash of the people who felt the biology was oversold and premature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA subsequently played down the notion of life on Mars and instead set out on a methodical campaign to explore the past geology and climate of Mars. Although Mars today looks dry and cold -- dead -- geological markings like gullies, dry lake beds and colossal canyons point to a liquid past. ''Follow the water'' became the mantra. NASA's last two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, found convincing evidence of environments that were habitable in the distant past. Curiosity will go further, looking for carbon-based molecules, including methane, that are the building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent orbital images show that water might still occasionally flow on the surface of Mars. New knowledge about life on Earth and how it can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, like the dark, boiling waters near ocean-bottom volcanic vents, also made scientists less dismissive of the notion that life persists on Mars. In 1996, a team of NASA scientists announced that they had found fossilized microbes in a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica. Those claims remain at least as controversial as the methane findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But short of photographing a cow or some other life form ambling among the rocks, Curiosity is not going to discover life. As with every NASA probe since the Viking landers, Curiosity is not carrying experiments designed to tell whether the building blocks of life ever came together to form life. If there are microbial Martians thriving in the soil, Curiosity will not see them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think we've put down enough groundwork,'' said Michael A. Meyer, NASA's lead scientist for Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is frustrating in particular for Gilbert V. Levin, who believes that his experiment on the Vikings 35 years ago, designed to detect life, did indeed detect life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drops of a nutrient solution containing radioactive carbon-14 were added to Martian soil, and a stream of radioactive carbon dioxide was detected rising out of the soil. That is what would be expected from micro-organisms eating the food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To rule out the possibility that a nonbiological chemical process was generating the carbon dioxide, other samples were heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit to sterilize them. No radioactive carbon dioxide was seen rising from those when the nutrient drops were added, fitting with the hypothesis that the heat had killed the Martian microbes. If a nonbiological process were at play, the radioactive carbon dioxide should have been seen after the sterilization as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other Viking experiments had failed to measure any organic molecules, so Dr. Levin's results -- even though they matched exactly what would be expected for life -- were like announcing the discovery of a brick house in the absence of bricks. The consensus was that the claim was mistaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent discovery, however, offers a possible explanation for how Dr. Levin could be right after all. In 2008, NASA's Phoenix landerfound chemicals known as perchlorates in the Martian soil. Viking's organic molecule detector heated the soil to release organics. But heating organic molecules in the presence of perchlorates destroys them, so even if they were there, Viking's experiment may have missed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levin said a more sophisticated version of his experiment, weighing a couple of pounds and costing a few million dollars, could definitively validate or disprove the Viking results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But they won't fly it,'' Dr. Levin said. ''Changing a paradigm is a tough thing. We've run this experiment thousands of times on Earth. It's never given a false positive. It's never given a false negative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two lander missions that are to follow Curiosity -- collaborations between NASA and the European Space Agency -- do not have a version of Dr. Levin's experiment planned. Christopher E. Carr, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is intrigued by the possibility that life on Earth could have started on Mars, has proposed an even more ambitious experiment: send a DNA sequencer to Mars.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high point was when I got to bomb Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In science fiction, wars between the Earth and her interplanetary colonies are a staple of the far future, but this was not that. Before we go to war with Mars, there has to be somebody living there to fight. Toward the end of the exhibition ''Beyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration,'' which opens at the American Museum of Natural History on Saturday, a visitor is confronted with a chance to help make the red planet, currently a frozen desert, livable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an interactive screen the size and shape of a Ping-Pong table, you can play God and direct the future evolution of Mars. The first task is to thicken its atmosphere and warm it up by liberating carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from its frozen soil and ice caps. You can bomb the planet -- although, to my disappointment, you can't aim the bombs -- or you can spray black dust on the ice caps to make them absorb sunlight and melt faster. Both of these made me feel like a delightfully naughty 6-year-old boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can even build factories with tall smokestacks billowing exhaust. ''I'm polluting Mars,'' I exclaimed, eliciting sage chuckles from the museum staff members nearby. After all, we've been practicing that for 500 years on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of the space program as a museum show seemed wildly and gloomily appropriate when I first heard about it. We think of museums as being for old dead things, and the space program, at least the American space program, seems ready for its own diorama as the space shuttle shuts down, the Moon landings recede into ancient history, and space science is slowly dismantled by a prairie fire of budget cutting and wild cost overruns in the few programs that are left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily we don't have to relive that. The idea of the exhibition is to look forward 50 or 100 years, not back, said Michael Shara, the curator of the show. ''We're at a crossroads,'' he said. ''We have to decide what to do when we grow up. Where is the vision?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, the vision is solely Dr. Shara's, he admitted, arrived at by picking the brains of space experts. Lest you get too excited, it does not yet represent the official agenda of NASA or any other agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world sorely needs some kind of cosmic blueprint going forward, if indeed we are to go forward and outward, and though one can quibble with many details, this one is as good as any. One can fantasize that this show could have the same long-range impact on shaping public expectations in space as magazine articles and television shows did in the 1950s. In that case, I hope it travels to the other countries that are now flexing their space muscles, like China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who think that human spaceflight is ridiculously expensive, wasteful, dangerous and unscientific -- a group that includes a lot of scientists I know -- might want to stop reading right here. The exhibition plays shamelessly to those of us who were captivated long ago by science fiction dreams and the notion that humanity's destiny is somehow tied to the stars. For the most part these plans don't come with price tags attached nor, for that matter, any indication of what currency the price should be denominated in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somebody will do these things,'' Dr. Shara said. ''Maybe not the U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The times being what they are, there is an iPhone app to go with the show. Point your phone at one of several special stations and extra information is downloaded into your hand; you can collect it and e-mail it. And the exhibits faithfully refer to the eight planets of the solar system -- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- which gives me heartburn every time. In my household, Pluto is still a planet. But this is a quibble compared to the uplift it gives to a weary sci-fi boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True to Dr. Shara's word, the show moves briskly through the past, starting appropriately with the achievements of the old Soviet Union, which launched the first satellite into orbit, sent the first man and woman into space and took the first pictures of the far side of the Moon. It moves on to American space feats: the Moon landings, the shuttle and a mockup of the astronaut John Grunsfeld inserting a new camera into the Hubble Space Telescope back in 2009 -- the real tools he used on that mission are hanging from the dummy's belt. But stop to savor the smell of moon dust (''like spent gunpowder'' according to the Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan) as recreated by NASA chemists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, private industry is beginning to take over what NASA once did. For $200,000 you can book a flight to the edge of space aboard SpaceShipTwo, the spaceplane being developed by Richard Branson's company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sooner or later -- in the year 2030, it says here -- humans will return to that gray, airless landscape. ''Just a three-day trip from Earth by spacecraft, the luminous Moon beckons,'' the show notes in travel-brochure language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We find ourselves in the Shackleton Crater, a depression near the Moon's south pole, where permanent shadows might shield ice left over from primordial comet impacts, making it a likely spot for a Moon base. The lunar inhabitants will keep busy mining helium-3, a rare form of the element useful for fusion reactors. Another chore might be constructing and then tending a telescope a kilometer across whose mirror is made of spinning liquid coated on the surface with gold nanoparticles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will ride around the Moon's surface in a buggy with chain-mail wheels and sleep in balloonlike habitats lofted from Earth and expanded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting there is also going to be interesting. By then, Dr. Shara figures, we will have had enough of the violence of rockets and will descend and ascend from the lunar surface on a lunar elevator, ''a skinny cable rising thousands of miles from the Moon into the sky,'' anchored at the far end by the gravity of the Earth. In time, Dr. Shara said, the cable could be extended almost all the way to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the corner from Shackleton, a scale model of the asteroid Itokawa hangs from the ceiling lumpy and brutish-looking. In 2005 it was visited by a Japanese spacecraft, Hayabusa, which brought back samples. Asteroids, which have been declared a target for deep-space exploration by the Obama administration, represent a sort of alpha and omega of the cosmos. Astronomers think they supplied life-giving water and organic materials to the Earth long ago. Some day in the far future, an asteroid colliding with the Earth could extinguish that life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one more reason to cast our covetous eyes toward Mars, the piece de resistance of possibility in this neighborhood of the cosmos and the longtime caldron of our space fantasies. To me, Mars is the emotional heart, the center of gravity, of the show. There is a psychological test you can take to see if you can tolerate the level of detail, stress and loneliness needed to make the flight there. I failed it miserably. If you get there anyway, you could wear new form-fitting spacesuits that make you look like a superhero -- visitors can pose as if they were wearing one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A full-scale model of the Mars Science Laboratory, a k a Curiosity, the latest rover scheduled to be launched to Mars this month, dominates the scene. Tilted on a red sand dune, it looks like some prehistoric creature with an overdeveloped head browsing the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once we dreamed of flying saucers from Mars; now perhaps Mars dreams of visits from us. Water flowed on Mars in the long past. Now the planet is dry, with an atmosphere about one-150th the pressure of our own. On a good day it resembles Antarctica. Did anything ever live there? Will anything ever live there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some geologists think that Mars could be transformed, or ''terraformed,'' into a livable planet over time in what would be the grandest and most expensive engineering project ever, one that would take thousands of years and entail the Mother of All Environmental Impact Statements and, yes, ''trillions of dollars.'' Only trillions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bombing the planet to thicken its atmosphere was just the beginning; next it would be seeded with bacteria, algae and trees to get the oxygen flowing. At the terraforming table, all my old preadolescent science fiction fantasies came alive again. If it wasn't going to happen in my lifetime, at least it might happen in someone's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everybody agrees that such a scheme would work, nor that we even have the right to do it. We will probably never be able to say there aren't microbes hiding somewhere on Mars -- deep underground, for example. They and whatever evolutionary potential they had would be destroyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Dr. Shara said he strongly suspected that we will terraform Mars. ''It goes with the human propensity for expansionism, colonization, the need to be real estate developers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, of course, with flowers blooming on Mars and settlers abandoning their domes to live under the open sky, we are thousands of years into the future. But the journey has still only begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step ''Star Trek'' style into the hologram at the end of the exhibit and you are surrounded by a thousand points of light that represent the first thousand stars found by NASA's Kepler spacecraft to have planets. Kepler is still only beginning its planet-hunting work. There are surely many more planets in the Milky Way that could be used as steppingstones, to expand into deeper and deeper space over the eons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's where we can go, where we should go, if we have the nerve,'' Dr. Shara said, ''and the focus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Beyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration'' is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Nov. 19 through Aug. 12, 2012, at the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, in Manhattan.

The flight opens a new era of American dependence on Russia, and eventually on commercial enterprises, for manned space travel, after the end of NASA's space shuttle program in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket launch went off smoothly at 10:14 a.m. from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, carrying an American, Daniel C. Burbank, and two Russians, Anton N. Shkaplerov and Anatoly A. Ivanishin, on the first trip into orbit by astronauts since the final shuttle flight in July.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz TMA-22 capsule is scheduled to dock at the space station on Wednesday morning, in time to relieve the crew of three who have been there since June and are due to return to Earth next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, what might have been a triumphal year for the Russian space program -- 50 years after Yuri Gagarin became the first human to go into space -- has been scarred by mishaps and mission failures, which had raised the possibility, now averted, that the space station would be left unstaffed for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soyuz mission was originally scheduled for September, but was delayed after an unmanned Russian cargo rocket similar to the one used for manned flights failed in August. NASA officials said before the launch on Monday that they were confident that their Russian counterparts had identified and corrected the problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a different Russian rocket also failed, putting a communication satellite in an incorrect orbit. And in a separate mishap last week, a Russian spacecraft that was intended to explore Phobos, one of Mars's two moons, got only as far as low-Earth orbit, where its engines failed to fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stalled probe, Phobos-Grunt, could end up ''flying inclusively until January,'' and then re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and explode, Vladimir Popovkin, the director of the Russian space agency, told reporters on Monday. Mr. Popovkin said that officials would continue to try to make contact with the probe, and that there was still a chance that control could be re-established and the mission resumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that Russia would not be deterred by the setback, noting that numerous attempts by various countries to send probes toward Mars had met with glitches or failures. ''Mars doesn't like Earthlings,'' Mr. Popovkin said, the Interfax News Agency reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Video images from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Monday showed the Soyuz astronauts in blue parkas on their way to board the rocket as snowflakes swirled in a blustery wind. The white snowscape around the launch pad briefly glowed bright orange as the countdown hit zero, the boosters fired and the gray rocket quickly accelerated to more than 3,000 miles per hour for a smooth launch into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the capsule's close quarters, the astronauts had hung a stuffed Angry Bird toy -- a character from the video game. For the first two minutes and six seconds of the flight, the red bird could be seen hanging straight down, demonstrating the pull of Earth's gravity. Then, as the manned capsule separated from the rocket booster, the bird started to bob upward. ''As you can see from the Angry Bird floating up above Shkaplerov,'' an announcer narrated helpfully on NASA-TV, ''the crew has reached orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burbank, a space flight veteran, will take charge of the space station, and the current commander, Michael Fossum, an American, and two flight engineers, Satoshi Furukawa of Japan and Sergei Volkov of Russia, are scheduled to return to Earth on Nov. 22. Another crew of three astronauts is scheduled to travel to the space station on Dec. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to carrying out dozens of scientific experiments, the newly arrived space station team will inaugurate the new era of commercial space expeditions, including the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket, built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, to deliver supplies to the station using a reusable capsule called a Dragon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another commercial resupply ship being built by <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., is expected to make the trip to the station next year, NASA said.</p>

''With every orbit around the earth, the craft is loosing altitude and speed,'' an official told the news agency Interfax.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space engineers scrambled Wednesday to salvage an ambitious science mission to Mars after the unmanned spacecraft became stranded in Earth orbit. If they are not successful, the probe, which is loaded with toxic fuel, could re-enter the atmosphere within days or weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, a high-stakes effort to bring back soil samples from the Martian moon Phobos -- and to return Russia to prominence in planetary exploration after a long dry spell -- was launched from Kazakhstan atop a Zenit rocket early Wednesday. Russian officials said that the launching was normal. But then, once the spacecraft was in orbit, two planned firings of its propulsion system, intended to send it on the nearly yearlong journey to Mars, did not occur.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The engines did not fire, not the first or the second time,'' said Vladimir Popovkin, director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unnamed person in Russia's space industry told the Interfax news agency that there had been warnings before the launching that glitches in the probe's command and control system had not been fully resolved. ''The risk of failure because of its abnormal operation was very high. Unfortunately, the worst forecasts have come true,'' the person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure left the 30,000-pound, $170 million probe, called Phobos-Grunt -- ''grunt'' being the Russian word for ground -- stuck in an egg-shaped orbit that at its lowest point is just 129 miles above the Earth. The atmosphere, though thin at that altitude, will create enough drag to eventually cause the spacecraft to fall to Earth. When and where that might happen, and how much of the spacecraft might survive a fiery re-entry, is impossible to predict at this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly two-thirds of the spacecraft's weight is in fuels, including hydrazine, which is highly corrosive and toxic. The probe also contains a small amount of radioactive cobalt used in one of its instruments, though that presents no danger, a person at the Kazakhstan launching center told the news agency Ria Novosti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers were waiting to re-establish communication with the probe -- expected early Thursday morning Moscow time -- to send new engine-firing instructions to its computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was no guarantee that the problem was a software one, and the engineers were racing the clock: although the spacecraft has enough power for at least three days and probably longer, the decaying orbit means it could soon reach a point where the engines would not be able to send it away from Earth, said Anatoly Zak, an expert on the Russian space program who tracks the country's efforts at russianspaceweb.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said it would help, if asked. ''Should Roscosmos need it, we will do our best to provide the services of the space communications and navigation networks, which support NASA's satellites and spacecraft,'' said Michael J. Braukus, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems with the spacecraft are the latest in a string of troubles for Russia's space efforts, including the failure in August of a Soyuz rocket -- the type that, with the end of the shuttle program, NASA now depends on to send astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. Russian engineers identified and fixed the problem, and a Soyuz rocket is scheduled to be launched Sunday night, ferrying two Russians and an American to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is also scheduled to send its own spacecraft to Mars this month, launching Nov. 25 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. NASA calls its Mars Science Laboratory ''the largest and most capable rover to be sent to another planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phobos-Grunt mission is Russia's first to the vicinity of a planet since a 1996 Mars project, which failed shortly after reaching Earth orbit and broke up over the Pacific. The spacecraft has a small return vehicle that is meant to hold about half a pound of soil samples, plus other instruments and equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at the spacecraft and count the number of instruments on it, very quickly it's apparent that this is a very complex mission,'' said Dwayne A. Day, a space policy analyst at the National Research Council. ''They shot for the sky with this one. So far it's kind of shocking that it ran into problems this early.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Day said that Russia's planetary exploration program had suffered with the country's economic woes. ''The Russian program was pretty much broke in the 1990s and much of the last decade, too,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two things have happened,'' he said. ''Everybody's out of practice -- the last time they built an interplanetary spacecraft was in the early 1990s. The other problem is that they lost a lot of people. They had a brain drain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Day added that the Russian approach of undertaking a large, complex mission after years with no projects at all contrasted sharply with NASA's strategy, which includes some smaller missions. ''Relatively junior people come in and work on these missions that are relatively fast turnaround,'' he said. ''This allows them to gain a lot of experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phobos-Grunt spacecraft is also carrying a 250-pound Chinese satellite that is meant to orbit Mars and study its environment. ''It's interesting that the Chinese were sending along a piggyback payload,'' said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''They have to be disappointed'' that the mission is in jeopardy, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pace said the Chinese had encountered difficulties cooperating with Europe on the Galileo global satellite navigation system, ultimately withdrawing from the project in 2007. And talk of cooperation in space with the United States had generated political controversy in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You wonder what they must be thinking about international cooperation,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bold attempt to revive its long-dormant planetary exploration program, Russia is scheduled to launch a new, technologically sophisticated spacecraft this week to gather soil samples from a Martian moon and bring them back to Earth for analysis. Back in the early 1970's, the Soviet Union, after losing the race to land humans on the Moon, brought back lunar soil samples with robotic devices. It also became the first nation to put robotic devices on Venus and Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such pioneering ventures ended after the Soviet Union disintegrated and the economy soured, depriving the space agency of funds. But now Russia is poised to launch a spacecraft that will land on Phobos, a 17-mile-long rock that is the larger of two Martian moons. It will conduct studies there, extract surface materials, put them in a container, and return them to Earth in a small capsule, all in less than three years. Along the way it will drop off a Chinese satellite that will orbit Mars to study its surface, atmosphere, magnetic fields and other processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goal is to learn as much as possible about the composition of Phobos to understand its origins, evolution and relationship to Mars and to the beginnings of the solar system. If the probe finds hydrated rocks or even ice just beneath the crust, that could make Phobos a potential future base camp for astronauts. Phobos has such weak gravity that it would be relatively easy for astronauts to land and take off from the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is a welcome sign that Russia and China, which previously focused on flights closer to Earth, are now interested in planetary expeditions. The American space program, which has studied Mars from satellites and with automated rovers on the surface, will also launch a mission later this month to search the planet's surface for signs of water-containing rocks or other conditions favorable to life. It will be helped by an instrument contributed by Russia, which has an enhanced ability to detect traces of water beneath the surface. This is an arena where the more participants the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- With a ''kiss'' more than 200 miles above Earth, a pair of Chinese spacecraft successfully coupled early Thursday morning, bringing the country one step closer to its four-decade quest for manned space exploration.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The docking of the Shenzhou 8 capsule with the Tiangong 1 module was broadcast live on national television. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao watched from the control center in Beijing, and thousands of citizens expressed their pride through Internet postings in what many referred to as the country's first ''space kiss,'' remarking how far China had come since its more impoverished days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming year, officials plan to repeat the unmanned exercise with astronauts as part of its mission to reach the moon and to launch its own space station by 2020. If all goes according to plan, China's floating laboratory would become airborne around the same time the aging International Space Station goes into retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American and Russian aerospace engineers perfected space docking in the 1960s, but Wu Ping, a spokeswoman for China's manned space program, said that Chinese scientists had come to this moment largely on their own, having domestically produced hundreds of components and instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This makes China one of the few countries in the world that can independently research and develop docking mechanisms,'' Ms. Wu said at a news conference on Thursday, describing the achievement as ''a historic breakthrough for our country and a huge technical leap forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Western scientists, however, said the successful mission provided stark evidence that the 20-year-old sanctions that limit cooperation between American and Chinese aeronautical engineers had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy, imposed by Congress shortly after Beijing's violent suppression of pro-democracy protesters in 1989, restricts scientific exchanges and blocks exports of space technology. Chinese scientists are barred from American space conferences, and China is not among the 15 countries whose astronauts are allowed to use the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two decades since it was frozen out of the world's elite space club, China has relied on its own aerospace engineers, aided by lavish government financing, to chase its space exploration dreams. In 2003 came the first successful human space flight, and in recent years Chinese scientists have mastered the manufacture and launching of communication satellites, many of which are sold to nations in the developing world. In 2008, Chinese astronauts took their first spacewalk, and last year China sent up a second lunar probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ominous turn, in 2007 Beijing successfully tested an antisatellite missile that alarmed Washington and angered many international scientists for rendering the target, an aging weather satellite, into potentially dangerous orbital debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Kulacki, China project manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an organization based in Cambridge, Mass., says the Congressional ban on cooperation with China spurs suspicion on both sides of the Pacific and fuels a costly, unnecessary space race. ''When we deny them visas, it breeds hostility among young Chinese scientists,'' he said, adding, ''the lack of cooperation could lead to miscalculations and escalated conflicts in times of crises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, he and other scientists say, cooperation has a multitude of benefits, especially in an era of trillion-dollar deficits. For one, the prohibitive cost of NASA's dreamed mission to Mars would be better shared by other nations, as John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser, has said in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony before a House panel on Wednesday in which he defended his contacts with Chinese officials, Mr. Holdren, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, tried to tamp down Congressional opposition to White House efforts that seek expanded scientific exchanges with China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed out that 30 years of cooperation had brought a multitude of benefits, from physics to pest control. The exchanges, he said, ''strengthen our hand in the effort to get China to change the aspects of its conduct that we oppose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many members of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee, however, were not impressed, citing Beijing's troubled human rights record and a growing number of cases involving technology theft from American companies. ''Any effort on our part to reach out to the Communist Chinese, to engage them on matters of technology is, quite frankly, not just naive but dangerous,'' said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The snubs may sting, but the restrictions do not seem to be holding back China's aerospace industry. In celebrating the successful docking on Thursday, Ms. Wu of China's manned space program said that even if its spacecraft were homemade, China would not exclude other countries from playing a role in its aerospace program. German scientists, she said, had equipped the Shenzhou 8, with a device for conducting experiments. And unlike the International Space Station, China's space laboratory will have no membership restrictions when it becomes operational. ''The planned Chinese space station will be open to global scientists,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 14, 2011, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 4 about the first docking of two of China's spacecraft, a milestone in the country's space program, misstated the number of partner nations that have access to the International Space Station. It is 15, not 16. (As the article noted, China is not among them.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By considering a proposal to put filling stations in the sky, NASA is looking to accelerate plans to send astronauts to distant destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The filling stations -- NASA calls them propellant depots -- would refuel a spacecraft in orbit before it headed out to the moon, an asteroid or eventually Mars. Currently, all of the fuel needed for a mission is carried up with the rocket, and the weight of the fuel limits the size of the spacecraft.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, engineers will meet at NASA headquarters in Washington to discuss how propellant depots could be used to reach farther into space and make possible more ambitious missions using the heavy-lift rocket that NASA is planning to build. The discussions grow out of a six-month NASA study of propellant depots, completed in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the space agency has rejected the study's most radical conclusion: that NASA could forgo the heavy-lift and use existing smaller rockets, combined with fuel depots, to reach its targets more quickly and less expensively. Those targets, for the next two decades at least, include a return to the moon or a visit to an asteroid. (A trip to Mars is unlikely until at least the 2030s.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This study highlights some interesting benefits of depots, but it is too singularly focused,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for NASA's human exploration and operations directorate, said in a statement. ''NASA is actively studying depots and how they can be used with other proposed elements to provide the lowest cost, sustainable exploration plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan outlined in the document, the propellant depot would be launched first, and then other rockets would carry fuel to the depot before a spacecraft arrived to fill up. That would increase the complexity for an asteroid mission -- 11 to 17 launchings instead of four -- but could get NASA astronauts to an asteroid by 2024, the study said. The total budget needed for the project from 2012 through 2030 would be $60 billion to $86 billion, the study said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, a study last year that designed an asteroid mission around a heavy-lift rocket estimated that it would cost $143 billion and that the trip could not happen until 2029. The earlier study briefly considered propellant depots but quickly dismissed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA announced the design of the Space Launch System, the new heavy-lift rocket. The goal is for it to lift 70 metric tons on its first unmanned test flight in 2017, and to be developed into a version capable of lifting 130 tons. The blueprint for NASA's direction for the coming years, passed by Congress last year and signed by President Obama, calls on the agency to develop just that rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the expense of developing and operating the massive new rocket, particularly in an era of tight federal budgets, would doom the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Congressional hearing in July, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, asked Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, about the possibility of depots as an alternative to the Space Launch System. General Bolden said that he did not know details about any propellant depot study, but that his agency had looked at alternatives to building a heavy-lift. ''It turned out that was not as economical, nor as reliable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although General Bolden promised to provide the information, Mr. Rohrabacher said he had obtained the study about propellant depots only through unofficial channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm shocked that the leadership in NASA would try to keep a report as significant as this away from decision makers of the legislative branch,'' Mr. Rohrabacher said, adding that the study gave him ''the ammunition to make a case'' to revisit NASA's plans for human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Propellant depots carry risks, too. Fuels like liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen must be kept at ultracold temperatures and, unless the depots were heavily insulated, would boil away over time. And transferring fuel in the weightlessness of space is not straightforward, although perhaps simply setting the depot and spacecraft into a slow spin would generate enough force to push the fuel into the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a simple thing to transfer cryogenic propellant, on the ground, much less in space,'' said Eugene M. Henderson, an engineer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, who is one of about 20 people who worked on the study. ''It's a big variable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he described the technical challenges as ''fairly trivial'' and said demonstration projects could show that the technology is feasible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants -- an eclectic mix of engineers, scientists, science fiction fans, students and dreamers -- explored a mix of ideas, including how to organize and finance a century-long project; whether civilization would survive, because an engine to propel a starship could also be used for a weapon to obliterate the planet; and whether people need to go along for the trip. (Alternatively, machines could build humans at the destination, perhaps tweaked to live in non-Earth-like environs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The space program, any space program, needs a dream,'' said one participant, Joseph Breeden. ''If there are no dreamers, we'll never get anywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Dr. Breeden who offered the idea of an engineless starship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A physicist by training, he had most recently devised equations that forecast to banks how much they were going to lose on their consumer loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From his doctoral thesis, Dr. Breeden remembered that in a chaotic gravitational dance, stars are sometimes ejected at high speeds. The same effect, he believes, could propel starships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, find an asteroid in an elliptical orbit that passes close to the Sun. Second, put a starship in orbit around the asteroid. If the asteroid could be captured into a new orbit that clings close to the Sun, the starship would be flung on an interstellar trajectory, perhaps up to a tenth of the speed of light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The chaotic dynamics of those two allow all the energy of one to be transferred to the other,'' said Dr. Breeden, who came toting copies of a paper describing the technique. ''It's a unique type of gravity assist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darpa, by design, pursues out-of-the-box projects without immediate military use. (In the 1960s and 1970s, for instance, the agency laid the groundwork for the Internet.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David L. Neyland, the director of tactical technology at Darpa, who orchestrated the one-year starship study, noted that his agency was founded more than 50 years ago as a response to Sputnik, the Soviet Union's cold war satellite coup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the research and development of technologies that could lead to a starship, he said, would likely create useful military spinoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At every step along the way in the space business, the Department of Defense has benefited,'' Mr. Neyland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the talks, speakers laid out challenges that, while herculean, did not seem out of the realm of the possible, even without resorting to exotic physics like ''Star Trek'' warp drives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the sheer distances are daunting. ''The problem of the stars is larger than most people realize,'' said James Benford, a physicist who organized sessions on starship propulsion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Obousy, president of Icarus Interstellar, an organization of volunteers that has already spent several years on starship designing, gave an analogy. If Earth were in Orlando and the closest star system, Alpha Centauri, were in Los Angeles, then NASA's two Voyager spacecraft, the most distant manmade objects, have traveled just one mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way of looking at the challenge is that in 10,000 years, the speed of humans has jumped by a factor of about 10,000, from a stroll (2.6 m.p.h.) to the Apollo astronauts' return from the Moon (26,000 m.p.h.). Reaching the nearest stars in reasonable time -- decades, not centuries -- would require a velocity jump of another factor of 10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first steps, however, are easy to imagine. Even in the 1950s, rocket scientists realized that the current engines -- burning kerosene or hydrogen and spewing flames out the nozzle -- are the rocket equivalent of gas guzzlers. They designed nuclear engines that use reactors to heat liquid hydrogen into a fast-moving stream of gas. NASA had such engines ready for a hypothetical manned mission to Mars to follow the Moon landings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the space agency has revived that work, beginning with studies on an ideal fuel for a space reactor, and new nuclear engines could be ready by the end of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for radioactivity concerns, the reactors would not be started until they reached space. ''Space is a wonderful place to use nuclear power, because it is already radioactive,'' said Geoffrey Landis, a scientist at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Ohio (and a science fiction author).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More advanced nuclear engines could use reactors to generate electric fields that accelerated charged ions for the thrust. Then fusion engines -- producing energy through the combining of hydrogen atoms -- could finally be powerful enough for interstellar travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Interplanetary Society put together a concept for a fusion-powered starship in the 1970s called Daedalus, extrapolating from known physics and technology. Dr. Obousy's group, Icarus Interstellar, is revisiting the Daedalus design to see if 30-some years of new technology can produce a better starship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daedalus dwarfs the Saturn 5, the rocket that took astronauts to the Moon. ''However, it's no bigger than a Nimitz aircraft carrier,'' Dr. Obousy said. ''We have the ability to create big things. We just don't have the ability to launch big things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Benford advocated another approach, harking back to the era of sailing ships. Giant sails on the starship could billow from photons beamed from Earth by lasers or giant antennae. ''Here's a case where we know the physics, and the engineering seems doable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, no one has yet built an energy-producing fusion reactor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the questions posed at the symposium seemed almost mundane: What kind of lights should a starship have? How do you pack enough spare parts for a 50-year trip when there's no <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> along the way? Other talks ruminated on theological and philosophical questions. ''Did Jesus Die for Klingons, Too?'' was the title of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vision without execution is daydreaming,'' Mr. Neyland said in his introductory remarks, paraphrasing a Japanese proverb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And what we're trying to inspire with the 100-Year Starship Study is that first step in establishing a bar that's high enough, with challenges that are hard enough that people will actually go start tackling some of these really hard problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Breeden, discussions with other attendees affirmed his underlying idea and calculations, but it seems unlikely that asteroid flinging would be sufficient by itself. Still, it could prove a useful and cost-effective supplement for other propulsions systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.1 million study -- $1 million from Darpa, $100,000 from NASA -- will culminate with the awarding of a $500,000 grant to an organization that will take the torch for further work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darpa would then exit the starship business, sidestepping interrogation by Congress during the next budget hearings of why it was spending taxpayer money on science fiction dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They want to get people thinking about a topic and propagate it very subtly,'' said Gregory Benford, a physics professor at the University of California, Irvine, who is also a science fiction author (and the twin brother of James Benford). ''They want it out of the budget by early next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps tellingly, no high-level NASA officials spoke at the symposium other than Pete Worden, director of the Ames Research Center in California, whom Mr. Neyland described as a ''co-conspirator'' and who is often regarded as a maverick in the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're lucky, it will change NASA,'' the science-fiction-writing Dr. Benford said of the starship research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some speakers said they thought the first goal over the next century should be colonizing the solar system, starting with Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Obousy, for one, made his preference known in a couplet:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On to the stars!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cowards shoot for Mars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and Lenovo, the computer manufacturer, announced on Monday a science contest called SpaceLab for students around the world ages 14 to 18, and it is not quite like any other science contest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, the students, who can enter individually or in teams of up to three, do not actually have to perform any experiments. Instead, they will make videos to pitch ideas for experiments that could be conducted in the zero-gravity environs of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two winning entries will be built and flown there, and astronauts will conduct a demonstration that will be broadcast to classrooms via <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The headline idea was, 'let's create the world's largest, coolest classroom in space,' '' said Zahaan Bharmal, director of European marketing for <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which owns <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These will not be the first student experiments to get to the space station. Students at 12 school districts around the country are currently writing proposals for experiments to fly there next spring, part of a program run by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education in Capitol Heights, Md. ''It's changing the way kids are looking at science,'' said Jeff Goldstein, the center's director. ''I'm hoping that what we're doing here is creating those magical moments for many of these students.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, 27 student experiments, out of 1,027 proposals, flew on the last two space shuttle flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those experiments were small -- each about the size of a test tube -- but meaningful. One, from seventh graders in Portland, Ore., tested the growth of protein crystals in microgravity, while another, from 10th graders in Omaha, was titled, ''Honey as a Preservative on Long Duration Space Flights.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These students are being given the opportunity to do real research in orbit,'' Dr. Goldstein said. ''It's not something cute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His program stems from an existing agreement between NASA and NanoRacks, a small company that owns laboratory space on the space station. The cost is $20,000 per school district, but the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education raised enough to pay for 21 of the 27 districts that took part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Goldstein said that he hoped to fly two sets of experiments every year, and that the next opportunity for school districts to participate would be announced in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NanoRacks has also sold space to a single school, Valley Christian High School in San Jose, Calif., which conducted a 30-day experiment in February looking at how basil, marigolds and Wisconsin fast plants, a relative of broccoli bred for classroom use, behaved in microgravity. (The seeds germinated, but did not grow much, possibly because of gases released from the sealant used to seal the box.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been able to see more of what a real-life science career would be like than if I had just gone through school and sat through the classes,'' said Karen Lu, a junior at Valley Christian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> contest, NASA has signed an agreement with Space Adventures, a company in Vienna, Va., that is best known for arranging trips by space tourists to the space station. Space Adventures will act as a middleman to prepare the winning experiments for flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bharmal came up with the idea when <span class="companylink">Google</span> invited employees to suggest a marketing campaign. ''When I was a teenager, 15 or 16, space was the thing that really inspired me,'' said Mr. Bharmal, now 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experiment proposals can cover science questions in biology or physics. Restrictions include no dangerous animals, no explosions and nothing sharp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Dec. 7 deadline, entries will be whittled to 60 finalists, distributed among three geographical regions. For each region, there will be 10 finalists in the 14-to-16-year-old category and 10 in the 17-to-18-year-old category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A popular vote among <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> visitors will provide one-quarter of the final score. Also judging the finalists will be a panel of experts including Stephen W. Hawking, the physicist and cosmologist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> will the fly the regional winners to a ceremony in Washington next March, where two grand prize winners will be named. Those winners will get the choice of a trip to Japan to see the launching of their experiments or a trip to Russia for seven days of cosmonaut training, although for the latter, they would need to wait until they turned 18.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three astronomers won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for discovering that the universe is apparently being blown apart by a mysterious force that cosmologists now call dark energy, a finding that has thrown the fate of the universe and indeed the nature of physics into doubt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers are Saul Perlmutter, 52, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley; Brian P. Schmidt, 44, of the Australian National University in Canberra; and Adam G. Riess, 41, of the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm stunned,'' Dr. Riess said by e-mail, after learning of his prize by reading about it on The New York Times's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three men led two competing teams of astronomers who were trying to use the exploding stars known as Type 1a supernovae as cosmic lighthouses to limn the expansion of the universe. The goal of both groups was to measure how fast the cosmos, which has been expanding since its fiery birth in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago, was slowing down, and thus to find out if its ultimate fate was to fall back together in what is called a Big Crunch or to drift apart into the darkness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the two groups found in 1998 that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up, a conclusion that nobody would have believed if not for the fact that both sets of scientists wound up with the same answer. It was as if, when you tossed your car keys in the air, instead of coming down, they flew faster and faster to the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent cosmological measurements have confirmed that roughly 70 percent of the universe by mass or energy consists of this antigravitational dark energy that is pushing the galaxies apart, though astronomers and physicists have no conclusive evidence of what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely explanation for this bizarre behavior is a fudge factor that Albert Einstein introduced into his equations in 1917 to stabilize the universe against collapse and then abandoned as his greatest blunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quantum theory predicts that empty space should exert a repulsive force, like dark energy, but one that is 10 to the 120th power times stronger than what the astronomers have measured, leaving some physicists mumbling about multiple universes. Abandoning the Einsteinian dream of a single final theory of nature, they speculate that there are a multitude of universes with different properties. We live in one, the argument goes, that is suitable for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every test we have made has come out perfectly in line with Einstein's original cosmological constant in 1917,'' Dr. Schmidt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the universe continues accelerating, astronomers say, rather than coasting gently into the night, distant galaxies will eventually be moving apart so quickly that they cannot communicate with one another and all the energy will be sucked out of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Witten, a theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study, Einstein's old stomping grounds, called dark energy ''the most startling discovery in physics since I have been in the field.'' Dr. Witten continued, ''It was so startling, in fact, that I personally took quite a while to become convinced that it was right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on, ''This discovery definitely changed the way physicists look at the universe, and we probably still haven't fully come to grips with the implications.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perlmutter, who led the Supernova Cosmology Project out of Berkeley, will get half of the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.4 million). The other half will go to Dr. Schmidt, leader of the rival High-Z Supernova Search Team, and Dr. Riess, who was the lead author of the 1998 paper in The Astronomical Journal, in which the dark energy result was first published.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three astronomers were born and raised in the United States; Dr. Schmidt is also a citizen of Australia. They will get their prizes in Stockholm on Dec. 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the fate of the universe is in question, astronomers would love to do more detailed tests using supernovas and other observations. So they were dispirited last year when NASA announced that cost overruns and delays on the James Webb Space Telescope had left no room in the budget until the next decade for an American satellite mission to investigate dark energy that Dr. Perlmutter and others had been promoting for almost a decade. Indeed on Tuesday the European Space Agency announced that it would launch a mission called Euclid to study dark energy in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic expansion was discovered by Edwin Hubble, an astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, Calif., in 1929, but the quest for precision measurements of the universe has been hindered by a lack of reliable standard candles, objects whose distance can be inferred by their brightness or some other observable characteristic. Type 1a supernovae, which are thought to result from explosions of small stars known as white dwarfs, have long been considered uniform enough to fill the bill, as well as bright enough to be seen across the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1980s Dr. Perlmutter, who had just gotten a Ph.D. in physics, devised an elaborate plan involving networks of telescopes tied together by the Internet to detect and study such supernovae and use them to measure the presumed deceleration of the universe. The Supernova Cosmology Project endured criticism from other astronomers, particularly supernova experts, who doubted that particle physicists could do it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, it took seven years before Dr. Perlmutter's team began harvesting supernovae in the numbers it needed. Meanwhile, the other astronomers had formed their own team, the High-Z team, to do the same work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hey, what's the strongest force in the universe?'' Robert P. Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and a mentor to many of the astronomers on the new team, asked a reporter from this newspaper once. ''It's not gravity, it's jealousy,'' Dr. Kirshner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with The Associated Press, Dr. Perlmutter described the subsequent work of the teams as ''a long aha.'' The presence of dark energy showed up in an expected faintness on the part of some distant supernovae: the universe had sped up and carried them farther away from us than conventional cosmology suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recounted by the science writer Richard Panek in his recent book, ''The 4% Universe, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of Reality,'' neither team was eager to report such a strange result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 1998, Dr. Riess interrupted preparations for his honeymoon to buck up his comrades. ''Approach these results not with your heart or head but with your eyes,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''We are observers after all!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years since, the three astronomers have shared a number of awards, sometimes giving lectures in which they completed one another's sentences. A Nobel was expected eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No more waiting!'' Dr. Kirshner said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online Correction: October 4, 2011, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the publication in which Adam G. Riess's 1998 paper on dark energy appeared. It was The Astronomical Journal, not Science. The article also stated incorrectly the amount of the prize.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOLDILOCKS is alive in the constellation Vela. Her real name is HD 85512b, which may not roll off the tongue, but it's sheer poetry to the ears of sky watchers like me, who long for signs of an Earth-like planet that might harbor life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This newly discovered planet orbits its sun in what's called the ''Goldilocks,'' or habitable zone, at the right distance for liquid water to sparkle on the surface and life to bloom in the shallows. Life as we know it, anyway, with wings and dreams, if the planet has a rocky surface -- and isn't too hot or too cold -- as well as a tent of clouds for shade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a lot of ifs, which is why other candidates have been scarce. This is our best hope, though she's 36 light-years away, beyond the reach of our spacecrafts or clear view of present telescopes, but well within the imagination. Her temperatures may range from 85 to 120 degrees, which conjures up images of equatorial Africa, or much of the hot, muggy United States this past July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past month has been a marvel in the planetary world. In addition to HD 85512b, astronomers spotted a planet that may be fashioned entirely of diamond, a brilliant diadem set in the black velvet of space. For all we know, it has baguette moons in tow. And a few weeks later, planet hunters confirmed the discovery of Kepler-16b, a planet that circles two suns in the constellation Cygnus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ''Star Wars'' saga, Luke Skywalker hailed from such a world, Tatooine, where he paused from work on his uncle's moisture farm to enjoy a smoldery suns-set. Until now a stable planet orbiting twin suns was science fiction, strictly hints and hunches. Wouldn't the quarreling gravity of two suns shear the planet apart, swallow it whole, or hurtle it off into space? Apparently not. Such solar systems, with winking suns that eclipse one another every few weeks, may be common throughout the universe. That's the best thing about discovery, how it widens the mind's eye, refines the scope of our inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, we won't be glimpsing these worlds anytime soon, I'm afraid. If we want to explore in fine detail, we'll need better eyes in the sky and faster robotic spaceships. I'm for both. Despite all the problems that beset us, we're on the threshold of a new era of exploration and discovery. Scientists are asking thrilling questions, like: what existed before the universe? How did we get from the Big Bang to the whole shebang? Can we design spaceships that fly faster than the speed of light? Do other planetarians haunt the wilderness of space, or are we alone? I hope we'll continue sending scouts around our solar system, and use the planets as stepping stones to the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a new goal, but one of humanity's oldest yearnings. Every society has been tantalized by the great loom of the sky with its flowing quilt of stars. The Egyptian pyramids may have been arranged like the belt stars of Orion, pointing to Sirius, so that the pharaoh's soul would be launched into the heavens where he'd shimmer as a star. To the San people in the Kalahari, the Milky Way is the ''backbone of night.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 20th century, we sent robot emissaries to explore the solar system and voyage deep into space. With the cupped ears of radio telescopes, we began listening for voices from other worlds. We rode fierce winds to the Moon and looked back in wonder, amazed to see Earth whole. Viewed from space, Earth had no visible fences, military zones or national borders. But it did have the thinnest rind -- an atmosphere embracing the sky, weather systems and all of human history. That image from an Apollo mission changed everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're explorers by design, right down to our cells, and we thrive on quests. Stars flare like distant campfires overhead, and we wonder if they're home to other worlds like our own. Or made of diamond. I'm hoping NASA will continue to find the boosters it needs, because our compass points to the stars.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When New York made its pitch for one of NASA's decommissioned space shuttles, one of its selling points was location: a glistening berth on the Hudson River alongside the aircraft carrier that is home to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But five months after the Intrepid was awarded the shuttle Enterprise, museum officials have turned their attention from the end of the newly revamped pier to a parking lot on 12th Avenue, across the cacophonous West Side Highway. They envision converting the lot, which is surrounded by H &amp; H Bagels, a car wash, storage warehouses and a strip club, into a space-themed museum that would serve as the home of the Enterprise and draw as many as one million visitors a year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aesthetics aside, the plan has several obstacles to clear. One problem is that the Intrepid does not own the parking lot; the State Department of Transportation does. Another is that the property, in Hell's Kitchen, is zoned for manufacturing, not a museum. And perhaps the biggest hurdle is the many millions of dollars that would have to be raised to build this new home for the Enterprise, which was a prototype for the space shuttles but never flew into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tentative state of the plan highlights how much less certain the Intrepid's proposal was than those of some other museums that lobbied for one of the shuttles. The Museum of Flight in Seattle, for example, spent $11 million to build a structure that would house a shuttle, but did not get one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston, home of the Johnson Space Center, was also shut out in a decision that enraged elected officials in Texas. Representative Ted Poe, a Republican, said the Intrepid's preference for a different location for the Enterprise might be cause to revisit NASA's selection process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as I'm concerned, it won't be final until it's sitting up there on the Hudson River where it's supposed to finally be,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokesman, Michael Curie, said agency officials were aware of the changes in the Intrepid's plans and did not ''foresee any issues that would prevent transferring Enterprise to Intrepid in 2012.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum's president, Susan Marenoff-Zausner, said in an interview that she envisioned a museum ''with the shuttle as the primary tenant'' but also with classrooms and laboratories for teaching schoolchildren and others about science and technology. ''It would be a museum on that side of the highway, which we think could be a linchpin in beautifying the area,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marenoff-Zausner said she had discussed the idea with NASA officials but had not yet made formal requests for financial help from the state or city governments. She said it was too soon to say just how big the museum would be, how it would look or what it would cost. But she suggested that the shuttle would be visible from outside the building and could ''get more exposure on the highway'' than on the pier that serves as the entryway to the floating museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When officials of the Intrepid museum first broached the idea of bidding for one of the shuttles, they said a transparent building would be constructed for it at the end of the pier. It was to replace a Concorde supersonic jet that has stood on Pier 86 since the pier was rebuilt three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Concorde, on long-term loan from <span class="companylink">British Airways</span>, is part of the Intrepid's eclectic collection of aircraft and military memorabilia. The ship that houses the museum played a minor role in the space program, picking up astronauts after they splashed down upon returning from space. The museum's executives used that connection in their bid for one of the decommissioned shuttles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As NASA was winding down the shuttle program, it offered its three remaining orbiters to museums. After fielding more than 20 responses, NASA, in April, awarded the shuttle Atlantis to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Endeavour to the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The third, Discovery, was awarded to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. There, it will replace the Enterprise, making the prototype available to the Intrepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the choices NASA made, the selection of the Intrepid drew the most complaints, as critics scoffed at New York's tenuous ties to the space program. On Wednesday, Mr. Poe renewed his objection, saying, ''That's like putting the Statue of Liberty in Omaha.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Marenoff-Zausner countered that the Intrepid's annex, on the east side of 12th Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets, would be ''the only representation of NASA in the entire Northeast corridor.'' She said that building a full museum would not necessarily change the schedule previously laid out by NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report last month that concluded a review of the shuttle awards, NASA's inspector general said the Enterprise would be moved from the Smithsonian to Kennedy International Airport in April 2012. It would be stored in a ''climate-controlled tent'' inside a hangar at the airport for about two years, then ferried on a barge to the Intrepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marenoff-Zausner was not prepared to say when the museum would be ready for the arrival of the Enterprise, or how it would be moved from a barge on the river and across the West Side Highway. She said the museum was preparing for fund-raising and would seek to change the zoning on the site to allow the museum. The site is part of an industrial section that was rezoned in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the first order of business is to strike a deal with the owner of the parking lot, the Department of Transportation. Museum officials met in late July with the state commissioner of transportation, Joan McDonald, to propose the plan. The commissioner has not yet decided if the state is willing to turn over the land, a spokesman for the department said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dead hulk of a NASA satellite the size of a bus is skimming the top of the atmosphere, and as air molecules bounce off, its orbit is decaying until gravity finally pulls it down as a fiery meteor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be specific, 26 large pieces of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, the heaviest about 330 pounds, are expected to survive all the way and hit the surface. The debris will stretch along a 500-mile path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time that NASA has been spewing out bland itinerary updates -- by Wednesday evening, North America had been ruled out as a crash pad -- the event has turned into a bit of a media and pop culture phenomenon. Just about every major news outlet started weighing in on the impending arrival. On <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, people were linking to news stories and adding their own ruminations, like ''Wear a hardhat'' and ''Should we be concerned?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Fox News, the anchor Shepard Smith dubbed Friday ''Bus Day U.S.A.'' and called the network's coverage ''the stupidest thing we've ever done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on MSNBC.com, about 5,000 readers answered a poll about the satellite's predicted course. Ten percent were ''relieved that it's likely to miss North America'' while 34 percent were ''bummed out at missing the fireworks'' and 42 percent were ''worried ... what about the rest of the world?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some concerned citizens took the opportunity to contemplate our collective plight. ''Many of us are hard-wired to be paranoid about things falling from the sky,'' wrote an editorialist in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ''Cold rain, rocks dropped by delinquents from highway overpasses and air show accidents freak us out. They awaken in us that primal fear that thunderbolts were flung from heaven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, this satellite's impending re-entry has not generated as much concern and good-humored fun as when the Skylab space station fell to Earth in July 1979. Skylab was much bigger -- about the size of a house -- while the current projectile is more along the lines of a city bus. When bits of Skylab fell in Western Australia, no one was injured but the local authorities did fine NASA $400 for littering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, John Belushi appeared on Weekend Update on ''Saturday Night Live,'' maniacally ramming a handheld model of Skylab into a globe. People threw parties, bought Skylab ''crash helmets,'' and wore T-shirts with bull's-eye targets. (The T-shirt wearers reasoned that the United States government could not hit the broad side of a barn, therefore by wearing a bull's-eye, they were safe.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, there has been little if any merchandizing. Various Web sites have tried to track the progress of the descending satellite, and Space.com has assembled a list of the ''worst space debris events of all time.'' Those include fallout from the explosion of the space shuttle Columbia, which rained on parts of Texas and Louisiana in 2003, and the small chunk of a Delta 2 rocket booster that fluttered onto an Oklahoma woman, Lottie Williams, in 1997 -- the only person known to have been hit by space debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has calculated a 1-in-3,200 chance of anyone on Earth being hurt by its satellite's death plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The funny thing is that I have a better chance of getting hit by this satellite than winning the lottery,'' Chanan Carroll, a Baltimore rabbi, wrote on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was not true, even when there was a possibility of the satellite landing in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odds of demise-by-satellite for any particular person among the world's seven billion people are much lower, on the order of 1-in-trillions, said Nicholas L. Johnson, NASA's expert on space debris at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Thursday afternoon, NASA had narrowed the time of re-entry on Friday to between noon and 6 p.m. Eastern time. The satellite circles the Earth four times in six hours, but none of the Friday afternoon orbits pass over North America. That increases the odds, still infinitesimal, for people living in areas of Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe that do lie along the trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rabbi Carroll, for one, thought that NASA's reticence in narrowing down the impact site to be clever disaster management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that NASA knows exactly where and when it's coming down,'' he wrote. ''If they let the word out, a thousand idiots will gather at the impact site, waiting to get whacked. And their lawyers can sue NASA. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science of predicting where a tumbling satellite is going to fall is tricky. The Earth's atmosphere puffs up and deflates depending on how strongly the sun is shining on a particular day, and that phenomenon speeds or slows the rate of falling. If a calculation is off by half an hour, the falling satellite has already traveled one-third of the way around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in 1991 by the space shuttle Discovery, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite was decommissioned in 2005 and placed into a lower orbit so it would not cause any problems for the International Space Station. Now, in what NASA calls an ''uncontrolled'' re-entry -- there is no more fuel to guide it -- it will plop down somewhere on Friday afternoon, give or take a few hours.</p>

But, on the lunar surface where the only breeze is the solar wind, there is an eerie permanence. Witness the photographs of three of the Apollo landing sites taken recently by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. They show the undisturbed trails left by American astronauts on foot and in their moon buggy four decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now asking what can be done to protect what it calls these ''heritage sites.'' What worries NASA is the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, which offers a $20 million reward to the first private team that can land a robot anywhere on the Moon, cover a distance of around 500 yards and send data and images back to Earth. Twenty-nine teams are in the race.</p>

The risk is that dust kicked up by a successful landing, or a crash, could disturb the traces of our presence on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no mention yet how the rules would be enforced. But they do give rise to some interesting thoughts. In the realms of science fiction, the universe abounds in the relics of civilizations scattered among the stars. These landing sites are the first, fragile relics left by actual humans on a nonterrestrial body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are a celebration of one of the 20th century's extraordinary achievements. Looking at their stark clarity -- footprints still precisely etched in the dust -- we also can't help remembering how quickly our own planet erases the traces of the past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the orange sun rises first. Sometimes it is the red one, although they are never far apart in the sky and you can see them moving around each other, casting double shadows across the firmament and periodically crossing right in front of each other.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is life, if it were possible, on the latest addition to the pantheon of weird planets now known to exist outside the bounds of our own solar system. It is the first planet, astronomers say, that has been definitely shown to be orbiting two stars at once, circling the pair -- which themselves orbit each other tightly -- at a distance of some 65 million miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of astronomers using NASA's Kepler planet-hunting spacecraft announced the discovery on Thursday in a paper published online in the journal Science, in a talk at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in a news conference at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., Kepler's headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official name of the new planet is Kepler 16b, but astronomers are already referring to it informally as Tatooine, after the home planet of Luke and Anakin Skywalker in the George Lucas ''Star Wars'' movies, which also had two suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reality has finally caught up with science fiction,'' said Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution, a member of the research team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, John Knoll, who is a visual effects supervisor at <span class="companylink">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</span>, which is part of <span class="companylink">Lucasfilm</span>, and who worked on several of the ''Star Wars'' movies, joined the Ames news conference and showed a clip from the original movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Again and again we see that the science is stranger and weirder than fiction,'' Mr. Knoll said. ''The very existence of this discovery gives us cause to dream bigger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some double-star systems, of which there are billions in the galaxy, have been suspected to harbor planets, those smaller bodies have never been seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a direct detection; it removes all doubt,'' said Laurance Doyle of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who led the discovery team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the wow factor, astronomers said the discovery -- as so many discoveries of so-called exoplanets have done -- had thrown a wrench into another well-received theory of how planets can and cannot form. ''In other words,'' said Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not part of the discovery team, ''people don't really know how to form this planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was long thought, Dr. Seager said, that for its orbit to be stable, a planet belonging to two stars at once would have to be at least seven times as far from the stars as the stars were from each other. According to that, Kepler 16b would have to be twice as far out as it is to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This planet broke the rule,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, by timing all the eclipses and transits of the planet and stars in the system, the astronomers have been able to measure the sizes and masses of the stars and the planet to unusually high precision, calibrating models of stellar and planetary properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe this is the best-measured planet outside the solar system,'' Dr. Doyle said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, Tatooine is probably a ball of rock and gas about the size and density of Saturn living in a system about 200 light-years away, in the constellation Cygnus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you go, pack to wear layers. Because those suns move back and forth all the time, temperatures on the planet can change by 50 degrees or more over the course of a few Earth days, from minus 100 to minus 150 Fahrenheit. So the weather is like ''a nippy day in Antarctica at best,'' as Dr. Doyle put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in 2009, is on a mission to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that have Earth-like planets. It scrutinizes a patch of some 155,000 stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra looking for dips in starlight when planets cross in front of their home stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the Kepler 16 system -- home to Tatooine -- there turned out to be a lot of dips. The two stars are about 20 million miles apart and produce two eclipses every 41 days as they take turns going in front of each other. One star is about two-thirds the mass of the Sun, the other about a fifth of the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there are smaller dips when the planet, which is about 65 million miles from the center of the system -- about the distance of Venus from the Sun -- passes in front of each of the stars in the course of its 229-day orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The degree of dimming during the planetary transits -- those times that a planet crosses the path of something else -- usually allows Kepler astronomers to measure the size of a planet relative to the stars. As a result, uncertainties in the properties of stars propagate into uncertainties of as much as 25 percent in the mass of a planet -- enough to blur the line between a rocky planet and a gaseous one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the Kepler 16 system, by comparing slight variations in the timing of the transits with calculations of the positions of the stars and the gravitational nudges the bodies give one another, Dr. Doyle's team could deduce the absolute masses and sizes of the stars and planets in the system. That is a tool, they say, that is becoming increasingly valuable for determining the masses of small planets in multiple-planet systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, said Dr. Doyle, ''it's a laboratory for all sorts of physics and stellar evolution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tatooine laboratory will be available to a wide audience for at least a while longer. Dr. Doyle noted that amateur astronomers in northern Asia, equipped with as little as an eight-inch telescope and an off-the-shelf C.C.D. detector (an electronic device that cameras use to capture images), would be able to record the passage of the Tatooine planet across the brighter star in its system on June 28 next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But enjoy it while you can. Because of variations in the planet's orbital plane, as seen from Earth, the planet will stop crossing one of the stars as soon as 2014 and cease transiting the other, brighter one in 2018. It will be around 2042 before the show starts up again for Earthlings.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To push farther out into the solar system -- to the moon and beyond, to asteroids, eventually to Mars -- NASA unveiled plans on Wednesday for a behemoth rocket that would serve as the backbone of its human spaceflight program for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finished rocket would be the most powerful ever to rise from the gravitational bonds of Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're investing in technologies to live and work in space, and it sets the stage for visiting asteroids and Mars,'' the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., said at a news conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The megarocket, blandly named the Space Launch System, embodies the space agency's enduring desire to aim far and dream big. But it also reflects a shrinking of near-term ambitions as budget cutters seek to rein in federal spending. Just two years ago, NASA had hoped to build an even larger rocket that would take astronauts back to the moon and set up an outpost there. With money more limited, the pace of progress will be much slower than during NASA's Apollo heyday in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Gerstenmaier, the agency's associate administrator for human exploration, said NASA expected to devote $3 billion a year to the effort, or a total of about $18 billion over the next six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be enough to finish a rocket capable of lifting 70 metric tons into orbit; the largest unmanned rockets currently available can lift about one-third that much. The first unmanned test flight is scheduled for 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design would evolve to larger versions that could lift up to 130 metric tons. (The Saturn V rocket that powered the Apollo Moon exploration program could lift 120 metric tons.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the previous program, Constellation, which set a very specific goal -- returning to the moon by 2020 -- NASA has yet to decide destinations or deadlines for what it would do with its new rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've talked conceptually about multiple destinations,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said. ''We talk about an asteroid in 2025. We talk about Mars being the ultimate destination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More details would be worked out over the next year. ''We can do pretty exciting missions with the capability that we've got,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional backers of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hailed the announcement as resolving a standoff between Congress and the White House over the agency's future. In February 2010, the Obama administration had proposed a radical shift in space exploration, canceling the Constellation program and deferring any decision on a replacement for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the administration retreated under Congressional pressure, first reviving the crew capsule from the Constellation program and now proposing a heavy-lift rocket that looks like Constellation's slimmer sibling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a day we've been looking forward to for a long time,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican. ''We wish it had been sooner, of course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, a blueprint for the space agency calling for a rocket like the one announced Wednesday. But NASA missed deadlines for announcing how it would carry out the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In frustration, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, where Senator Hutchison serves as ranking member, even issued a subpoena to NASA demanding information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unveiling of the heavy-lift rocket was a victory for Ms. Hutchison and Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the commerce committee's science and space subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas is home to NASA's Mission Control and Florida is where NASA's rockets are launched from. The two senators played key roles in writing the NASA blueprint and outlining many specifics of the rocket they wanted NASA to build, leading critics to sarcastically call it the Senate Launch System.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement took place on Capitol Hill, not NASA headquarters, and at the news conference it was Senator Nelson who spoke first for five minutes, describing the characteristics and capabilities the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, General Bolden said, ''I'm the administrator and not the expert at NASA'' and deferred technical questions to a subsequent telephone news conference that Mr. Gerstenmaier held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics note that NASA has announced ambitious rocket plans before, only to cancel them as costs escalated and schedules slipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, there will be budget cuts,'' said James Muncy, a space policy consultant. ''Yes, it will be stretched out. Yes, it will have problems. And yes, it will fall apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Constellation program, unveiled in 2005, spent more than $10 billion and flew one prototype rocket before it was canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Grunsfeld, the former astronaut who flew on several space shuttle missions to repair the Hubble Space Telescope and is now deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: ''The only good thing about the initiative is that NASA is moving on something, and that the jobs are preserved. It also means we'll have this discussion again in two years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To speed development and control costs, the design is based on pieces from the just-retired shuttles and the canceled Constellation program. The first stage is an elongated shuttle fuel tank, and it would use the same rocket engines as the shuttles. For the initial test flights, two solid rocket boosters -- stretched versions of what flew on the shuttles -- would provide additional thrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also announced plans for a competition to design more powerful boosters, each providing 3.9 million to 5 million pounds of thrust, for the more powerful version of the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The schedule beyond the first test flight depends on future budgets. The first rocket that is to fly in 2017 will consist of a single stage. Internal NASA documents suggest that if the space agency's budget remains flat, providing about $41 billion from 2012 through 2025, NASA will not be able to do much work on the second stage, needed to increase the lift capability, until after 2017, and the first manned flight would not occur until 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent flights would occur only once every year or two, and the final version, capable of lifting 130 metric tons, would not be completed for two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more money, perhaps as much as $62 billion over the next 14 years, the agency estimated that the first manned flight could be moved up by three years and the 130-metric-ton rocket could be available by 2021. It could fly up to two missions a year and still have enough to start developing the necessary pieces for a mission to an asteroid, like a deep-space habitat -- essentially a living room for astronauts during long space trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Hutchison said there was now broad support from the administration and both parties in Congress on the space exploration plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said even among the ardent budget cutters in her party, ''they have not cut the core mission of NASA, because they see that as part of the American spirit and most certainly part of the American economy and America's national security where we cannot afford to be in second place.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the space shuttle program after the last flight in July was meant to usher in a new era where NASA could move on to more ambitious destinations and nimbler, cheaper private companies would take over the job of ferrying people and supplies to the orbiting research station. But a series of recent rocket malfunctions -- including one on Aug. 24 by a Russian ship that was taking supplies to the space station -- has made this approach look tenuous.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be better if the space station were not reliant on any one nation,'' said Scott Pace, director of the space policy institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American companies have contracts with NASA to carry cargo to the space station and hope eventually to win contracts to serve as space taxis for humans. But their success is hardly assured. The <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., one of two companies that are to start taking cargo to the space station next year, suffered a setback in June when an engine caught fire during a ground test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other company, the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif. -- or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- has come under criticism because it did not disclose until last week a brief overheating of the engines during an otherwise highly successful test flight last December. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> aims to take its first load of cargo to the space station in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin, a space company started by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, suffered a major failure during a flight test last month of a vehicle it is designing to carry tourists to the edge of space. The crash was unrelated to its NASA-financed project but raised questions about the secretive company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was the crash of the Russian cargo ship that has had the most immediate consequences, because that rocket is similar in design to the one the Russians will use in November to carry astronauts, including one American. An investigation traced the failure to a manufacturing defect on a fuel pipe that caused the third-stage engine to shut down. The finding created concerns about quality control in the Russian rocket factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Russian space agency postponed the next manned launching to Nov. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station has a crew of six, but three will return this week on one of the two Soyuz capsules docked there. The capsules are certified to last six months in orbit. The other three crew members must leave in the remaining capsule by Nov. 19, leaving little leeway for further delays if the space station is to remain occupied. Astronauts have lived on the space station continuously for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission control on the ground can operate an empty station, but could be helpless if a malfunction sends the $100 billion station tumbling out of control and putting at risk practically the entire human spaceflight program of the United States, Russia and the other participating nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian space officials said they would launch two unmanned Soyuz rockets -- one launching satellites and the other carrying cargo to the space station -- before sending up people again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA, there is no short-term solution, and space experts and policy makers hold clashing views on what the agency's long-term approach should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the American contractors, they are nowhere near ready to launch people into space and probably will not be until 2015 at the earliest. And in Washington, the White House and Congress continue to argue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration proposed $850 million for the next fiscal year to further finance commercial development of astronaut-carrying ''space taxis'' -- what NASA calls its commercial crew program -- while Congress has put a higher priority on a large NASA-designed rocket for astronaut missions beyond low-Earth orbit. A budget bill passed by the House provided only $312 million for commercial crew efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, commercial crew advocates say the Russian travails show that Congress should follow the White House's blueprint. ''If the space station goes splash, it's $100 billion down the drain,'' said John Gedmark, executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group. ''This is why it is so important that the U.S. providers get up and flying as soon as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also appears to be broadening its rocket choices. It announced on Tuesday an agreement with <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>. of Minneapolis to help with its proposed Liberty rocket. Alliant built the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttles and was working on a longer version for the first stage of Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberty closely resembles the Ares I with an almost identical first stage, but would use a European-built second stage to speed development. NASA would not pay Alliant, but about two dozen NASA employees would work full time on the project.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European astronomers said Monday that they had found what might be the best candidate for a Goldilocks planet yet: a lump of something about 3.6 times as massive as the Earth, circling its star at the right distance for liquid water to exist on its surface -- and thus, perhaps, to host life, as we narrowly imagine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as HD 85512b, is about 36 light years from here, in the constellation Vela. It orbits its star at about a quarter of the distance that Earth circles the Sun, taking 58 days to make a year. That distance would put it in the star's so-called habitable zone, if the planet is rocky and has some semblance of an atmosphere -- ''if everything goes right and you have clouds to shelter you,'' as Lisa Kaltenegger of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, summarized it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers cautioned, however, that it would take years and observations from telescopes not yet built before those assumptions could be tested and a search for signs of life could be undertaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither humans nor their robot helpers are likely to be dispatched toward Vela anytime soon. But the finding did vault HD 85512b to the top of a list of the handful of Goldilocks candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vela planet was part of a haul of more than 50 new exoplanets -- as planets around other stars are called -- discussed in a news conference on Monday hosted by the European Southern Observatory. They are the newest fruits of an eight-year observing program by astronomers based at the University of Geneva and led by Stephane Udry and Michel Mayor, working from a telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. About 16 of them are so-called super-Earths, with masses less than 10 times the Earth, further encouraging astronomers that they are on the verge of finding planets like ours. A pair of papers -- one with Dr. Mayor as lead author and the other with Francesco Pepe, also of Geneva, as lead author -- have been submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics, describing the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Geneva astronomers used a sensitive spectrograph known as Harps (an acronym for High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) to detect wobble in the stars' motions as planets swung around them. The wobble technique, however, only reveals the masses of exoplanets. Without further information like the size -- which NASA's Kepler satellite, also in the exoplanet business, measures by seeing the shadows of planets as they cross in front of their stars -- or the composition, the astronomers cannot say for sure whether the Vela planet is made of rock, steam, iron, diamonds or something else. Nor can they tell what, if any, atmosphere it has. Kepler will be of no help because its gaze is fixed on a different swath of sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star that the Vela planet circles is known as HD 85512, or Gliese 370, after Wilhelm Gliese, a German astronomer. The star is orange, about two-thirds as massive and about an eighth as luminous as our Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study led by Dr. Kaltenegger, Dr. Pepe and Dr. Udry concluded that HD 85512b was potentially habitable if it had more than a 50 percent cloud cover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov of the Center for Astrophysics, who has followed this work but is not part of the team, said that Dr. Kaltenegger and her colleagues made reasonable assumptions. He called the result ''very solid'' and ''a major step in the right direction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were less impressed by the case for habitability. Sara Seager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted that Dr. Kaltenegger's model atmospheres were limited to water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, like the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A very terracentric view,'' she said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Seager said, ''Would I bet $1 that this is a habitable planet? No. If I had a space telescope that could look at the atmosphere, would I point to the planet? Yes.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- A Russian commission has pinpointed a clogged fuel pipe as the reason a Soyuz rocket crashed into a forest in Siberia last month before it reached orbit, but the panel offered no guidance on when this type of rocket would again be considered ready for manned missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While narrowing the cause of the accident to one part, the commission also raised broader and difficult-to-address concerns about quality control in the Russian factories that make parts for the country's manned space program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirming initial reports, the commission said the first and second stages fired as planned on Aug. 24. But the third stage shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doomed rocket was carrying supplies on a Progress unmanned cargo spaceship to the International Space Station, but it was similar to the model that used to ferry cosmonauts and astronauts into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipe that clogged was a small but integral part of the third-stage engine, according to a statement by the Russian Space Agency, which said its engineers had reached this conclusion by analyzing telemetry. Despite a lengthy search with helicopters, the authorities have yet to find any debris in the dense pine forest where the rocket crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipe sent kerosene to a small turbine that was not generating thrust but, instead, providing power to pump kerosene and liquid oxygen into the main combustion chambers, according to the statement.''This disrupted the engine's operations, affected its parameters and activated the system that switched off the engine,'' the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However reassuring that finding may be for space officials in Russia and at NASA, which has rented seats on the Soyuz rocket as the only means for Americans to reach space after the retirement of the space shuttle this summer, pinpointing the cause as a manufacturing flaw is likely to increase jitters about Russian safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission shared this concern. ''The members of the commission came to the conclusion that the manufacturing defect was accidental,'' it said. ''But a decision can be taken to qualify it as a single instance only after a thorough re-evaluation'' of quality control in the entire parts supply for the third-stage engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission recommended that the space agency put into effect a better quality-control program for engine parts and offered a suggestion for the plant that made the flawed pipe: ''video surveillance of workers at the final assembly line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission ruled out errors by the ground crew that prepared the rocket. Such an error could have been fixed by changing the launching procedure, said Marina Alekseyenkova , an aerospace analyst at the large government-controlled bank <span class="companylink">Gazprombank</span>, in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A design flaw might also be quickly addressed. But the design of the engine, which has been flown successfully for years, is hardly in question, she said, while manufacturing defects could be hard to systematically eliminate, with hundreds of parts made in scattered, Soviet-era factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are talking about an assembly problem,'' she said. ''This is really a bad sign for the industry. It means that everything made should be checked and checked again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians' troubleshooting comes at a critically important time for NASA, as members of Congress and the White House are in a dispute over the scale of financing for the private spaceship ventures that are intended to replace the shuttle. Underscoring the risks of private space designs, a test craft of Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, also crashed Aug. 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unclear how long the Russians might require to carry out the new controls, like videotaping assembly workers. The statement said officials would draft a timeline for launchings, including manned missions. The Russians had said they would launch two Soyuz boosters carrying unmanned spacecraft -- a cluster of satellites and a cargo ship -- before sending up a crew including American astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Russians cannot verify the safety of the Soyuz by mid-November, Russian and American authorities have said, the International Space Station might have to be left temporarily without a crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A previous version of this article misstated when Jeff Bezos's test craft crashed. It was Aug. 24, not last week.nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>
