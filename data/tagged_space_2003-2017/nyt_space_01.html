<span class="companylink">NASA</span> is getting new looks at Jupiter, from close up and far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its Juno spacecraft made its fifth just-above-the-cloud-tops dive of Jupiter on March 27, its eight instruments gathering data on the planet's interior as it accelerated to 129,000 miles per hour.</p>

This time, one of the winning targets was a boundary between two atmospheric regions. The bluish streak on the right is part of a persistent storm. Juno snapped this image 7,900 miles from the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> released an image of Jupiter taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which is in orbit around Earth. The distance, 415 million miles, is the closest that Earth gets to Jupiter, which makes it a good time for Hubble to perform a once-a-year survey of the solar system's largest planet. The space telescope is able to discern features on Jupiter as small as 80 miles across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can map out the full planet,'' said Amy A. Simon, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who led the observations. ''On a first glance, the Great Red Spot is still strikingly colored. It stands out quite well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Simon said that Jupiter's atmosphere appears to be more turbulent than in the past couple of years. ''That's telling us something about the deeper atmosphere,'' she said. ''We're going to be analyzing this over the next few months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Hubble observations roughly coincided with Juno's flyby, scientists will be able to match the close-ups with a wider view of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could do a two-for-one there and help out Juno at the same time,'' Dr. Simon said.</p>

It showed the lights of the Gaza Strip from above; what the astronaut saw but the static shot did not capture were rockets flying over the strip amid the region's 50-day war between Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on earth, at least one person was instantly captivated.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was immediately like, download, print,'' said Céline Semaan, a Lebanese designer and the founder of Slow Factory, a Brooklyn fashion company that began in 2012 with the goal of creating and selling products that raise awareness around issues such as the plight of refugees or the threat of global warming. Eventually, Ms. Semaan printed the image onto silk scarves for a collection called ''Cities by Night.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current political climate has provided ample fodder for her creative challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, Ms. Semaan, who arrived in Canada with her parents in the late 1980s as a refugee herself, will add scarves with images of cities in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- the seven countries President Trump named in his original immigration ban in January -- to the series. They follow a more earthly item: a simple, elegant brass necklace with a key charm dipped in white gold, made by Armenian artisans in Lebanon, symbolizing the homes that refugees leave behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the keys and the accompanying look book, featuring refugees, children of refugees and activists from various creative fields, Ms. Semaan is seeking to highlight both the struggles and the triumphs of the approximately 65 million people scattered around the world whose treatment has recently been a contested topic in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a success story,'' Ms. Semaan said. ''I made it in America. There are a lot of people like us who are not represented in the media.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with all of Slow Factory's products, a portion of the proceeds from the necklace sales have been earmarked for a charity. In this case, 10 percent will go to job-training programs run by American Near East Refugee Aid, or Anera, which provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians and poor families in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WATCH: Our reporter visits Slow Factory in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anera has collaborated with Slow Factory since Ms. Semaan originally created the Gaza by Night scarves in 2014. ''We raised enough money to build a school in Gaza,'' she said. She added that Anera also used the funds to supply women in Gaza with so-called dignity kits, containing scarves, underwear, soap and feminine hygiene products. Other projects focusing on the environment, on outer space and on women in science have followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Semaan, a user experience designer, creative director and 2016 M.I.T. Media Lab Director's Fellow, approaches manufacturing with the mind-set of an engineer, sourcing materials from groups like Thread International, which produces fabric from recycled plastic bottles gathered by workers in Haiti and Honduras; using zero-waste printers; and creating a collection out of T-shirts from secondhand stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do a lot of research,'' she said. ''Designing for people is inevitably designing for our planet. When we use materials that harm our planet, we're not doing ourselves any favors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Semaan considers the key a universal symbol. ''I saw a lot of Palestinian grandmas wearing the keys on their necks in Lebanon,'' she said. ''When I came to the United States, and I discovered Tiffany, I was like, 'Oh, people wear keys around their necks here, too.' Even DJ Khaled has a key in his Snapchat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, a correspondent for AJ Plus, part of the <span class="companylink">Al Jazeera Media Network</span>, featured in the key collection look book, was attracted to the project despite having little interest in the fashion world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shihab-Eldin explained that though he had visited refugee camps in Lebanon as a reporter, he had felt limited in his ability to help those whose stories he has told. ''This makes me feel connected to them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hala Abdul Malak, who founded Design and Flow, teaches at Parsons School of Design and also modeled for Slow Factory, said she saw items like the keys as a way to prompt conversations about cultural dissemination and appropriation. ''Everybody expresses themselves one way or the other through what they're wearing,'' she said. ''It's easy to bridge boundaries through clothes and fashion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though it is also easy to dismiss the adaptation of such issues into commercial products, an insistence on context is part of Ms. Semaan's mission. ''Céline knows what it's like to be a refugee,'' said Maggie Forster Schmitz, vice president for philanthropy at Anera. ''She's genuine in her interest in helping refugees and marginalized communities in the Middle East.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COLORADO SPRINGS -- Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a ''golden age of space exploration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,'' he said. ''You will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I've witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the first-paying customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the heavy-lift rocket until many years after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin's commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a mistake to race to a deadline when you're talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you're going to put people on,'' he said. ''I still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250,000 a ticket, although that company's spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos's ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a single-stage booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about one-third of the surface area of the dome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110,000 pounds of thrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the padded-dome interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m.p.h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the concept is similar to the procedures <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has used to recover the boosters for its Falcon 9 rockets, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s endeavors have been far more challenging, because the boosters must accelerate to speeds of thousands of miles per hour in order to put payloads on a trajectory to reach orbit. Just last week, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> successfully launched a satellite into space with a reused booster, a first for commercial spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Bezos and his Blue Origin team believe that New Shepard, which is expected to fly many times, will give the company ample practice and experience that can be applied to New Glenn, which will be manufactured and launched in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Shepard booster on display at the Colorado symposium made five successful up-and-down flights beginning in November 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its last flight, in October, included a test of an emergency-abort system that is designed to blast the capsule -- and, eventually, passengers -- to safety in case something goes wrong with the booster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his long-term vision involves having millions of people living and working in space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Experiments have found that many microbes survive and even thrive in a space-vessel environment. But most do much worse when exposed to some of the actual conditions of outer space, either in the laboratory or in space, according to an extensive review of space microbiology, published in 2010 in the journal Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, was in the midst of a 75-day survey of a patch of sky known as the Chandra Deep Field-South, when it recorded the burst from a formerly quiescent spot in the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a few brief hours on Oct 1, 2014, the X-rays were a thousand times brighter than all the light from its home galaxy, a dwarf unremarkable speck almost 11 billion light years from here, in the constellation Fornax. Then whatever had gone bump in the night was over and the X-rays died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event as observed does not fit any known phenomena, according to Franz Bauer, an astronomer at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and lead author of a report to be published in Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely explanation, Dr. Bauer said in the paper and in an interview, is that the X-rays are the afterglow from a gamma ray burst seen sideways. These are caused by the collapse of a massive star into a black hole or the collision of a pair of the dense stellar remnants called neutron stars, and squirt gamma rays but only in one direction. If Earth is out of the beam then all astronomers will see is an ''orphan afterglow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if that were the case, a typical afterglow would appear about a hundred times more intense than it is, Dr. Bauer said, unless this was an unusually weak event, or it came from much farther away -- from something far behind the little galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility, the astronomers said, was that this was the result of a star being torn apart by a black hole, but that would produce a different spectrum of X-rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is to say: None of the usual cosmic catastrophe suspects work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately there is no 'smoking gun' evidence that favors one scenario over the other here,'' Dr. Bauer wrote in a recent blog post.</p>

<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launched a commercial satellite into space on Thursday with the boost of a partly used rocket, a feat that may open an era of cheaper space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Falcon 9 rocket from <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> -- formally <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, based in Hawthorne, Calif. -- lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to deposit the payload, a telecommunications satellite that will service Latin America, in the proper orbit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was noteworthy was that the first stage, or booster, of the rocket had already flown once before. It could conceivably launch again, since it returned in one piece, landing on a floating platform in the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It did this mission perfectly,'' Mr. Musk said during a <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> broadcast of the launch. ''It dropped off the second stage, came back and landed on the drone ship. Right in the bulls-eye.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A commercial flight employing a reused rocket is a stride toward reducing the cost of sending payload to space, for business ventures like satellite companies in particular. For Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, replicating this flight with reusable rockets on a regular basis would be a crucial step toward his dream of sending people to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It means you can fly and refly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket,'' Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, almost all rockets have been single use. Once the fuel is spent, a rocket stage plummets to Earth, a quick demise to a complex machine that cost tens of millions of dollars to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk has likened that to scrapping a 747 jet after one flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booster for Thursday's flight had been part of the rocket that carried cargo supplies to the International Space Station for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> last April. As the rocket's second stage and cargo capsule continued to orbit, the booster steered itself back and set down on the floating platform, which is playfully named ''Of Course I Still Love You.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the platform returned to port in Jacksonville, Fla., the booster was refurbished, tested and deemed ready for another flight. SES, the company that owns and operates the satellite launched Thursday, was the first commercial customer for a Falcon 9 in 2013, and it signed up for the first flight with a recycled booster at a discount from the usual $62 million launch price. Neither SES nor <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has publicly said how large the discount was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk has suggested that rocket launches could eventually be much cheaper because the cost of rocket propellants is less than 1 percent of the full price for a launch. So if a rocket could simply be refueled like a jetliner for another flight, the cost of space travel could drop to a fraction of what it is now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How that might play out in practice is still unclear. The same reasoning led <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to develop space shuttles in the 1970s, but the savings never materialized because of the extensive refurbishment of the orbiters needed between flights. ''We were pushing a lot of technology,'' said Daniel Dumbacher, a former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> official who is now a professor at Purdue University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, however, has a better chance. The Falcon 9 was designed from the start to be reusable. Its engines, for example, do not offer cutting-edge performance -- but that means they are simpler and more robust, and thus easier, faster and cheaper to get ready for the next flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've taken the right first steps,'' Mr. Dumbacher said. ''This is where you just have to get out and do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reusable rockets may soon become commonplace. Blue Origin, a rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, is putting similar emphasis on rockets that can be flown many times, not just once. <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, is also looking to incorporate reusability in its next rocket, Vulcan. But instead of landing the entire first stage, the plan is for the engine compartment -- the most valuable part -- to eject and descend via parachute, to be plucked out of the air by a helicopter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the near term, reusable rockets could lower the cost of launching satellites and thus make space affordable to more companies for more uses. Currently, most satellites are used for telecommunications or for observations of the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his Mars dreams, Mr. Musk envisions a gargantuan spaceship he calls the Interplanetary Transport System that would someday transport humans. That would be far too expensive to be thrown away, so <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> needs to solve the reusability problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps an even greater challenge is finding a way to finance the development of such a large rocket. Today, most of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s revenue comes from launching satellites for commercial companies and from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> contracts to take cargo and, soon, astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cliffs collapsed, boulders moved, cracks opened up, and jets of dust and gas erupted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are some of the transmogrifications that scientists discovered as they pored over two years of photographs of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko taken by Rosetta, the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> spacecraft whose comet-trailing mission came to a conclusion in September.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unexpected shape of the comet -- like a rubber duck instead of a simple sphere -- was most likely the result of a merger of two comets in the distant past. As 67P approached the sun, jets of dust and gas sped up the spin of the comet, increasing stresses on the body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crack in the neck of the comet, initially about 550 yards long when Rosetta arrived in August 2014, lengthened by 30 to 45 yards A new crack, about 160 yards long, opened up nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This comet is probably eventually going to split up as it speeds up more and more,'' M. Ramy El-Maarry, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado, said during a news conference on Tuesday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference outside Houston. ''When is that exactly going to happen? Of course, I have no idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. El-Maarry and his colleagues published their findings this week in the journal Science. A second paper, in the journal Nature Astronomy, described how the collapse of one particular cliff set off an eruption of dust and gas from the comet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Rosetta, astronomers had only brief glimpses of comets. Rosetta's journey around the solar system allowed the spacecraft to accompany Comet 67P, about 2.5 miles wide, for two years of its 6.5-year orbit as it approached the sun and then swung back out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two close-up images of the same spot on the comet, one taken in May 2015, before the comet made its closest approach to the sun, and the other about a year and half later as it was moving away, most features of the landscape were unchanged. But a boulder that was bigger than most houses had moved more than 160 yards, or more than the length of a football field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the minuscule gravity of the comet, that would have required the same amount of force for lifting a 550-pound boulder on Earth, Dr. El-Maarry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculations indicate that a powerful gas outburst could have shoved the boulder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some places, ripple patterns appeared, disappeared, then appeared again. In other places, the surface eroded quickly, at a pace of several yards a day, when the comet was closest to the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet none of the events that Rosetta observed could have created the giant cliffs and huge depressions seen on the surface, and the duck-shaped comet, as it sped away from the sun, looked pretty much like the same duck as when Rosetta arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That indicated that the comet was much more active earlier in its lifetime, Dr. El-Maarry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Nature Astronomy paper, Maurizio Pajola, a postdoctoral researcher at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., and his colleagues described a collapsed cliff that he had spotted in an image taken in December 2015. But an image of the same spot the previous year showed a rock overhang that had a 230-foot-long, three-foot-wide crack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pajola then searched through other images to figure out what had happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cliff was intact on July 4, 2015. The next time Rosetta observed it, on July 15, it had collapsed, leaving new boulders piled at the foot of the 440-foot-high cliff, with bright, reflective material from the comet's interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pajola estimated that 780,000 cubic feet of cliff had collapsed -- about the volume of nine Olympic-size swimming pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lower-resolution camera observed a plume of dust rising off the same region of Comet 67P on July 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were pretty sure it was an outburst directly related to the cliff collapse,'' Dr. Pajola said. ''So we were lucky this cliff collapse happened right in front of our eyes.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDIf you're an astronaut aboard the International Space Station, you spend much of your time running science experiments. Among the jobs for Thomas Pesquet, a 39-year-old Frenchman currently there on a six-month stint: using virtual reality to gauge the effects of zero gravity on his hand-eye coordination, trying out a suit designed to keep weightlessness from stretching out his spine, analyzing the microbes in his water and directing a robot in the Netherlands from about 240 miles up. In his spare time, he posts photos on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> of what's passing beneath him: Mount Etna erupting, the artificial islands of Dubai, the Australian Outback, the entire country of Denmark.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, however, there was a more unusual item on Mr. Pesquet's agenda. Working with the earthbound artist Eduardo Kac, he created an artwork in space. It was a simple piece: nothing more than could be done with two sheets of paper and a pair of scissors. ''Since the goal was to be born in space, it had to be created with materials that were already in the space station,'' Mr. Kac (pronounced katz) explained in a telephone interview from his home in suburban Oak Park, Ill. Transporting art materials by rocket ship was not in the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artwork -- a piece of paper cut into an M, and another piece of paper rolled into a tube and stuck through the middle of the M -- might look a bit silly on Earth, where gravity would accentuate its flimsiness. But floating weightlessly in the space station, it looks fragile, even magical -- not unlike the planet beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewed with a certain amount of imagination, the paper construction can be said to spell ''moi.'' Mr. Kac, a professor of art and technology at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, means this not as an individual ''me'' but in the collective sense: His ''moi'' stands for all of us. The piece itself is called ''Inner Telescope,'' for reasons that become clear only when you look through the O formed by the paper tube and view a tiny portion of Earth. ''We point a telescope to the stars,'' he said. ''But this is a telescope that from the stars we point to ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kac's artwork was made possible by the Space Observatory, an office of France's National Center for Space Studies that focuses on the cultural aspect of space exploration. Beginning Friday, March 24, the observatory is hosting its annual celebration of art and space at the center's headquarters in central Paris, just opposite Les Halles. Among the participants will be Mr. Kac, who will show a 12-minute art video of the paper cutout being assembled and floating through the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a simple, powerful work, evocative of language and poetry,'' Gérard Azoulay, the director of the Space Observatory, said by email in French. The contrast between the humble materials required to make it and ''the ultra-technological context in which it was realized intensifies its emotional power,'' he said. ''And it's only meaningful in a state of weightlessness.'' Outside the Earth's gravity, it can move freely, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is hardly the first time Mr. Kac has done something out of the ordinary. In the 1990s, after graduating from college in his native Rio de Janeiro and earning an M.F.A. at the Art Institute, he made a name for himself as a progenitor of ''bio art,'' meaning art made with living matter. For his 1999 work ''Genesis,'' he created a so-called ''artist's gene'' by writing a sentence from the Book of Genesis first in the dots and dashes of Morse code and then in the four-letter alphabet of DNA, creating an artificial gene that was subsequently incorporated into bacteria. By shining short-wavelength ultraviolet light on the bacteria, viewers online were able to alter its genetic code. When that was translated back into Morse code and then into English, a mutation occurred in the sentence from the Bible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following year, Mr. Kac enlisted scientists at the French National Institute of Agronomic Research to splice a genetic sequence that produces green fluorescent protein into the DNA of an albino rabbit. The result was ''GFP Bunny,'' a white rabbit that glowed green under blue light. The bunny, also known as Alba, was one of many such lab-generated creatures. Though the process that created her is now widely used in medical research and the scientists whose work made it possible were eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the idea that this could be art generated considerable controversy at the time. Mr. Kac considers the whole thing hypocritical, given that painters have been sealing their canvases with rabbit skin glue for centuries. ''Behind every da Vinci, Velázquez, Goya or Picasso,'' he said, ''there are countless dead rabbits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kac's focus on transgenics -- the transfer of new genes into existing organisms -- has long been matched by a fascination with escaping gravity. In 2007, he published ''Space Poetry,'' a manifesto in which he called for writing ''that requires and explores weightlessness.'' In Western languages, he points out, you read from left to right, in others from right to left. But almost universally, you read from top to bottom. As with writing, so with art. ''Look at the splatter paintings of Pollock,'' he said. ''The entire history of art has operated under an unspoken guiding force, which is gravity. So I started to ask myself in the '80s, what if we could remove this restraint?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries, it is safe to say, were not falling all over themselves to support space poetry. But Mr. Azoulay, an astrophysicist at the National Center for Space Studies -- known by the French acronym CNES -- had founded the Space Observatory in 2000 as a ''laboratory of the arts and sciences.'' The idea, he said, was ''to encourage the world of culture to create, in addition to stories of science and history and politics, stories of space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, of course, no shortage of space stories, from H. G. Wells's ''The War of the Worlds'' (1898) to ''Star Wars'' (1977) to last year's ''Arrival.'' But for the most part, Mr. Azoulay said, ''directors and screenwriters use their imagination to construct a story and then try to give it credibility by tapping into the available literature in magazines or on the internet, or by interviewing experts,'' as Ridley Scott did for ''The Martian.'' A film like ''Hidden Figures,'' based on a little-known, real-life story, is closer to what Mr. Azoulay has in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, he has opened the archives of CNES and even established an artists in residence program. There are 10 or so artists on the roster at the moment. Among them is Bertrand Dezoteux, whose recent video ''Waiting for Mars'' used marionettes to portray astronauts who in 2010 and 2011 spent 520 days in an isolation facility in Moscow on a simulated mission to Mars, and the novelist Christine Montalbetti, who published a book last fall about Sandra Magnus, a NASA astronaut who was on the final mission of the United States space shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was as an artist in residence several years ago that Mr. Kac started developing ''Inner Telescope.'' To him, a key aspect of the project is ''how this work speaks to a future that has yet to be invented'' -- 30 years from now, when space travel could be as common as air travel is today, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will this future be like? ''Imagine we find ourselves floating -- it's going to be an amazing sensation. Looking at the Earth will be amazing. But by the third day, you're going to start asking other kinds of questions. I wonder, what can you do in space that you cannot do on Earth? What would space cuisine be like? What would space theater be like? What would space poetry be like, in terms of developing something that is truly unique to that environment? Because now we're talking about the cultural dimension of space in a different sense'' -- not how space affects culture on Earth, but how culture will evolve in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 55, Mr. Kac is unlikely to go to space himself, and when he started talking with Mr. Azoulay, it was anyone's guess when another French astronaut would go. Mr. Pesquet had long dreamed of space travel, but at the time he was an airline pilot, flying the Airbus A320 passenger jet for <span class="companylink">Air France</span>. In 2009, however, he was selected for the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s training program, and in 2014 he was assigned to a mission on the International Space Station. Mr. Kac was introduced to him a year later at the Paris Air Show. In 2016, they met again to rehearse the operation -- how to cut the paper, how to record the experience on video -- at the European Astronaut Center outside Cologne, Germany. ''I trained him,'' Mr. Kac said, ''and he trained me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pesquet -- who jogs, sails, skis, plays basketball and squash, enjoys mountain biking and has a black belt in judo -- is clearly more jock than artist, though he does play the saxophone. Still, he has taken to the ''Inner Telescope'' project with evident enthusiasm. In November, shortly before blasting off on a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome on the steppes of Kazakhstan -- the only spaceport capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station -- he took a moment to describe his mission for posterity. His choice of words was perhaps inevitable: ''It will be a small step for man,'' he said, ''and a giant leap for art.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 1972, as Apollo 17 flew toward the moon, one of the astronauts (no one seems to remember who) picked up one of the mission's 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras and took the first-ever complete photograph of the Earth. The so-called blue marble picture became possibly the most widely distributed image in history. It is credited with a profound shift in global environmental consciousness, the view of Earth against the absolute darkness of space giving a simple form to our sense of the planet's beauty and fragility, and our absolute dependence on its ecology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same era, the golden age of manned spaceflight, also saw a cultural preoccupation with the extraordinary psychological situation of the astronaut. What did it feel like to find yourself outside Earth's life support system, far from the fellowship of other humans? The flip side of the profound loneliness of space is the tantalizing possibility that by transcending physical boundaries, spiritual forms of transcendence will follow. Figures like David Bowie's Major Tom, the spaceman who refuses to come back to Earth in the song ''Space Oddity,'' and Bowman, the astronaut in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' who is pulled by the alien monolith across vast reaches of space and time, are only the most prominent representatives of a genre that, judging by the success of recent Hollywood movies like ''Gravity'' and ''The Martian,'' retains its enduring fascination. The lonely astronaut can be a modern Robinson Crusoe, a white-knuckled survivalist, an existential freak and seer. For J.G. Ballard, who used the morbid figure of a dead astronaut orbiting the Earth in several short stories, the corpses become monuments, Ozymandias-like ruins that condemn the spiritual and intellectual failure of the military-industrial space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jakub Prochazka, the Czech hero of Jaroslav Kalfar's zany first novel, ''Spaceman of Bohemia,'' is an astronaut who has left a lot of baggage back on Earth. He is the shining hope of an entire nation, the biggest celebrity in his home country, so excruciatingly aware that his endeavor ''will carry the soul of the republic to the stars'' that he refuses water before liftoff lest he should inadvertently urinate and ''the purity of my mission'' become ''stained by such an undignified gesture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason the Czech Republic is launching a manned spacecraft is the arrival of a strange comet that has ''swept our solar system with a sandstorm of intergalactic cosmic dust.'' A cloud, named Chopra by its Indian discoverers, now floats between Earth and Venus, turning the night sky purple. Unmanned probes sent out to take samples have returned mysteriously empty. Likewise a German chimpanzee has returned to Earth with no information save the evidence that survival is possible. The Americans, the Russians and the Chinese show no sign of wishing to risk their citizens, so the Czechs have stepped up, with a rocket named for the Protestant reformer and national hero Jan Hus. At many points in the novel, Kalfar sketches key moments in Czech history, and the very premise of a Czech space mission is clearly a satire on the nationalist pretensions of a small post-Communist nation. Financed by local corporations whose branding is placed on his equipment, Jakub is the epitome of the scrappy underdog, grasping for fame by doing something too crazy or dangerous for the major players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on Earth he has left his wife, Lenka, and as the novel opens it is clear that their marriage is in trouble. Jakub feels guilty that on his last morning on Earth, he refused the breakfast she cooked; now he worries that this ''violation of a ritual'' is at the root of the ''long silences and lack of humor'' that have begun to cloud his video chats with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen weeks alone in space give Jakub plenty of time to think, and to fret about his mental health. He begins to hear scuttling noises on board the ship and fears that despite all other indications, he is losing his mind. In one of the most eyebrow-raising devices in a book not afraid of bold contrivances, he finds himself face to face with a spiderlike alien, a creature with many eyes, triple-jointed legs and ''a set of thick human lips, startlingly red, lipstick red, and .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. a set of yellowing teeth which resembled those of an average human smoker.'' The arachnid with the red lips has the ability to sift through Jakub's memories and speaks in the stilted, over-formal register that has long been traditional to aliens. A wife is a ''female partner,'' eggs are ''ova of the avian kind.'' The creature has ''discovered from your fictional television programming about soap that your species does not always utilize sexual intercourse solely for breeding.'' As will be clear from these examples, this isn't science fiction like, say, Ted Chiang's ''Story of Your Life'' (the basis for the film ''Arrival''), in which the writer pays scrupulous attention to xenolinguistics or rocket propulsion or the other nuts and bolts of a hypothetical world. Instead, the space mission, the alien and all the rest of the book's extravagant conceptual furniture are merely metaphors for the human-scale issues that are its real concerns, in particular the collapse of Jakub's marriage to Lenka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say Kalfar hasn't done his research. There are lovingly detailed passages on the mechanics of going to the toilet and cleaning your teeth in orbit, the dangers of muscle wastage and other minutiae of life in zero gravity, but all the whizzy space business is harnessed to the basic question of what it means to leave and whether it's possible to come back. The alien acts as a Proustian trigger for Jakub's memories, ''bringing about thoughts without my consent.'' We discover there are things in the past he needs to repress. Jakub's father was a devoted Communist, who worked as a secret policeman and tortured dissidents for the state. In the post-Communist era the family are among the losers, and Jakub's mission is, among other things, atonement for his father's crimes. Kalfar's satire of Czech Communism treads familiar territory (Jakub's rocket takes off from a ''state-owned potato field,'' while TV actresses are ''replete with the look of strong femininity and fierce dedication to the Party''), which, being retrospective, lacks the urgency that this kind of writing used to have before the Velvet Revolution. But for all the strangeness of outer space, it is the writing about his home village, the place to which he longs to return and perhaps never can, that beats strongest in this wry, melancholy book.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth sails through streams of cosmic debris as it orbits the sun. When specks of dust and ice left behind by comets or asteroids collide with our atmosphere, we experience meteor showers. But what we're seeing are only the final moments of a particle's path through space. Most flecks have traveled for millions of miles before we see them burn up (if we're lucky).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, astronomers and engineers have created an animation that lets you witness the entire journey. Using data from the Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance, a network of about 60 cameras pointed at the sky above San Francisco Bay, researchers have recorded more than 300,000 meteoroid trajectories since 2010. They plan to use the data to confirm more than 300 potential meteor showers that scientists have observed, but not verified.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each dot that you see is a shooting star that was captured by one of our cameras,'' said Peter Jenniskens, an astronomer at the SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, Calif., who runs CAMS. His interactive transforms meteor showers like the Geminids and the Orionids into shimmering rivers of space rocks. Viewers can pinpoint the moment the Lyrids or Eta Aquarids light up the night by watching when their streams intersect with the Earth's orbit, shown in blue. There is even an option to see all the meteor showers at once, making it look like a meteor hurricane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cameras that Dr. Jenniskens operates are like video surveillance cameras, but they are directed toward the night sky, watching for meteors. By having multiple cameras observing the same shooting star, he can determine the meteor's speed and direction through the atmosphere. Using that information, his computer software can estimate the space rock's path through the solar system. Then, by collecting enough data on meteors traveling from the same direction around the same time with the same speed, he can sketch out the orbit of an entire meteor stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observations also show that meteor showers, especially those that last for weeks or months at a time, move from night to night, according to Dr. Jenniskens. The Perseids, for example, get their name from the constellation Perseus because they appear to originate from that point in the sky during their peak in mid-August. But the cameras also observed that Perseids meteors are closer to the constellation Cassiopeia in July when they are first detected, and nearer to the constellation Camelopardalis in September. He attributes the drift to Earth's curved path around the sun, which changes the direction from which the particles hit the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also saw that several meteor showers, most noticeably the kappa Cygnids and the omicron Eridanids, drift widely throughout the duration of the shower. He said that Jupiter's gravity might be responsible for warping their meteor streams. In a paper published recently in the journal Planetary and Space Science, he identified 45 streams that move in the night sky. The animations were created by Ian Webster, a software engineer who worked with Dr. Jenniskens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jenniskens hopes the visualization will show skygazers what is behind the scenes of their favorite celestial light shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Next time you see a meteor shower, go to the tool and see what you're actually looking at,'' Dr. Jenniskens said. ''It'll make your experience of watching shooting stars more exciting.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not behind your refrigerator or underneath the bed. It's in a galaxy with only a number for a name in a constellation called Sculptor, and so far away that its distance barely has any meaning. The light from A2744_YD4, as it is known, has been on its way to us for 13.2 billion years, since the universe was only 600 million years old.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the galaxy is ''now'' is only a mathematical extrapolation -- about 30 billion light-years from here, according to the standard cosmological math. An international team led by Nicolas Laporte of <span class="companylink">University College London</span>, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, a radio telescope in Chile, was able to see this galaxy only because its light had been amplified by the gravity of a massive cluster of galaxies lying right in front of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interspersed with radio emissions from stars, the astronomers were surprised to find the characteristic heat emanations from some six million solar masses of dust. The dust consisted of tiny grains of carbon, silicon and aluminum -- an austere and unevolved version of the same stuff under your fingernails, and in the dust bunnies under your bed. The big news is that it existed in such quantities only 600 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primordial universe, as it emerged from the Big Bang, consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, the simplest and lightest elements, according to astronomers, with only a slight trace of lithium. The heavier elements, needed for planets and us among other things, were manufactured in stars, which then blew up. As the story goes, the exploding stars scattered their ashes across space where they could be incorporated into new stars and repeat the cycle, gradually enriching the chemistry of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new observations show that this relentless progression from dust to better-and-better dust had already been jump-started by the time the universe was just 600 million years old. The first stars had already been born and died in less than 200 million years in a wave of supernova explosions, according to Richard Ellis, of the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> and the <span class="companylink">University College London</span>, and one of the leaders of a paper published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, in the baby boom years of the universe, the young galaxy was feeling its oats, pumping out 20 new stars a year. By comparison the Milky Way, our own galaxy, today births only one star a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new results augur a bright future for the ALMA telescope, a $1.5 billion array of antennas tuned to record the heat emanations of stars and dust, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s coming James Webb Space Telescope, designed to investigate the early days of the universe. ''More observations should pinpoint the period when galaxies began to be first polluted by heavy elements,'' Dr. Ellis said in an email from London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until now, studies of early galaxies have largely been based on measures of colors and masses,'' he said. ''Now, finally, we are using chemistry.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Cassini spacecraft took the photographs on Tuesday, passing within 15,268 miles of the moon, which has a diameter of about 20 miles, roughly the size of New York City.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carolyn C. Porco, a visiting scholar at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, who leads Cassini's imaging team, was asleep when Cassini's shots were transmitted to Earth. She first saw an image on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw this picture, and I thought, that's an artist's conception,'' she said. ''Then I realized it was real.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the clearest images ever seen of Pan, named after the flute-playing Greek god of hunters and shepherds. They depict a ridge around the moon's Equator that rises perhaps a couple of miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The detailing in the last images is just astounding,'' Dr. Porco said. ''You can see where this ridge actually curves like a ribbon and where it's not completely smooth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pan is one of Saturn's shepherd moons, clearing out a 200-mile-wide space in Saturn's rings known as the Encke Gap. ''To see it with that detail, to be able to count craters on it,'' said Mark R. Showalter, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who discovered Pan in 1990, ''I could remember when it was not even a pixel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1980s, astronomers noticed that the ring edges along the gap had a scalloped appearance, almost like waves of water, possibly the wake of a small moon orbiting within the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By refining the calculations, Dr. Showalter, then at the NASA Ames Research Center, figured out an orbit for the unseen moon. He went back to images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its flyby of Saturn in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the first image I looked at, there was Pan,'' Dr. Showalter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ridge is most likely a pile of ring dust that fell on the moon as it cleared out the Encke Gap. ''It looks like some of it is very steep,'' said Peter Thomas, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science who helped plan the Pan encounter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini, in orbit around Saturn since 2004, has only a few months left. With its maneuvering fuel almost exhausted, the spacecraft will be sent on a swan dive into Saturn in September. But before that, it will make a few more orbits from a different angle, enabling it to study Saturn and the moons in new ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Pan flyby, the spacecraft was pointed in the right direction, capturing a sequence of images. ''If you see it edge on,'' Dr. Porco said, ''it really looks like a walnut, except the equatorial ridge is more extended.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, during a flyby of Daphnis, another of the shepherd moons, Cassini was able to successfully take only one photograph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, it will aim at Atlas, yet another shepherd moon, which, in the blurrier images seen to date, also resembles a flying saucer. ''It's built in the same way,'' Dr. Porco said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All new books, but debut novels especially, are blind dates. The raconteur who charmingly burbles during drinks is tapped out of stories by the time the oysters arrive; the genius who wears his erudition so lightly over appetizers starts clubbing you over the head with it during dessert. (No, your mind screams when things turn. And it was all going so well.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I start a lot of debut novels in this job. Most betray me at some point or another -- though a few make my heart do cartwheels, or at least a pirouette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaroslav Kalfar's ''Spaceman of Bohemia'' is not a perfect first effort. But it's a frenetically imaginative one, booming with vitality and originality when it isn't indulging in the occasional excess. Kalfar's voice is distinct enough to leave tread marks. He has a great snout for the absurd. He has such a lively mind and so many ideas to explore that it only bothered me a little -- well, more than a little, but less than usual -- that this book peaked two-thirds of the way through. Sigh. Don't we all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cast of this production is small. The spaceman of the title is Jakub Prochazka, a Czech astrophysicist who, as the book opens in 2018, launches into space from a state-owned potato field. Just 18 months earlier, a comet from a neighboring galaxy had swept into the Milky Way, bringing with it a cloud of intergalactic dust that permanently ''bathed Earth's nights in purple zodiacal light, altering the sky we had known since the birth of man.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cloud was unbudging, and therefore unnerving. Then it started to consume itself. Someone had to investigate. The Czech Republic is the first country to offer a human to hoover up particle samples. So away Jakub goes, seeking honor for his country and redemption of his family name. Before the Velvet Revolution, his father had been a member of the Communist Party's secret police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your father was a collaborator, a criminal, a symbol of what haunts the nation to this day,'' says the senator who recruits Jakub for the journey. ''As his son, you are the movement forward, away from the history of our shame.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But solitary space travel -- eight months in Jakub's case; four out and four back -- is not without its problems. It is hell on his marriage, for instance. Thirteen weeks into his voyage, Jakub's wife, Lenka, leaves him, occasioning a major reckoning with his motives for undertaking such a dangerous mission. (It also gives him many excuses to drain his stash of whiskey. Deep space is no place to experience marital strife.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space travel is also hard on Jakub psychologically. At roughly the same moment that his wife leaves, a monstrous, hairy spider appears on the spaceship. For a while, we assume that it's a hallucination, a companion spun from Jakub's lonely imagination. (His state-appointed psychologist had warned him about such things. ''I need to sleep you off,'' Jakub tells the spider. ''Like a stomachache.'') But soon, we begin to suspect: Perhaps this creature is real?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here it becomes clear that Kalfar has much larger aims with ''Spaceman of Bohemia'' than to write a spry, madcap work of speculative fiction. The giant spider has ready access to Jakub's unconscious, and ransacks it repeatedly, releasing a cascade of defining memories: of Jakub's falling in love with his wife; of his parents' deaths when he was 10; of watching his grandparents endure humiliation and hardship to raise him. The spaceman becomes the most far-flung analysand in the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these memories are inseparable from the history of the Czech Republic, and the book becomes, as much as anything, a rumination on that history, both recent and distant. Among Jakub's most painful recollections are those of his family's participation in the brutal workings of the state. (I won't reveal his father's specific role, but it's one of the book's most involving and satisfyingly realized story lines.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The desperate desire to become his father's opposite, we slowly see, is what has propelled Jakub into space. He believed he was the biological carrier of his father's curse -- ''the last remnant of Cain's sperm'' -- which meant he had no choice, really, but to lead a life of spectacular repentance. A psychoanalyst might say his fate was overdetermined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kalfar has an exhilarating flair for imagery. (''What good am I, a thin purse of brittle bones and spoiling meat?'' Jakub wonders to himself after his parents die.) He writes boisterously and mordantly, like a philosophy grad student who's had one too many vodka tonics at the faculty Christmas wingding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is generally a good thing, though it can also mean periodic forays into pretentiousness. In raking through the contents of Jakub's mind, the spider makes a study of human beings more generally -- the pain of our individuality comes as quite a shock -- and some of its observations about ''humanry'' can be self-satisfied, grating; the book is just sturdy enough to withstand its most irritating declamations without collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of Jakub's marriage, the spider, the voyage into space -- they all get their moments, but not all of them get their proper due; at the very end, there are philosophy and more soliloquizing where resolutions ought to be. That such speechifying can be forgiven says something about Kalfar's wild imagination, his ingenuity, his heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Endings are just so very hard. Kalfar, if I had to guess, is from the E. L. Doctorow school of writing: You let your characters guide you. (''You never see further than your headlights,'' Doctorow once told The Paris Review, ''but you can make the whole trip that way.'') The problem is that headlights in deep space don't really work. Unless the light bounces off something, it simply gets swallowed up in the dark.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Jeff Bezos, the billionaire chief executive of Amazon, founded a rocket company as a hobby 16 years ago. Now that company, Blue Origin, finally has its first paying customer as it ramps up to become a full-fledged business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos announced that customer, the satellite television provider Eutelsat, on Tuesday. In about five years, Eutelsat, which is based in Paris, will strap one of its satellites to a new Blue Origin rocket to be delivered to space, a process it has done dozens of times with other space partners.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Blue Origin, the relationship represents its evolution from an engineering-obsessed company into one that also seeks to make a profit eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That goal may be a moon shot, with high risks, high costs and no guarantee that enough customers need transportation beyond Earth. Blue Origin, based in Kent, Wash., has launched only its New Shepard rocket to the edge of space, 62 miles up, before returning to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial partnership brings Blue Origin closer in line with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, created by Elon Musk, which has been launching satellites and taking <span class="companylink">NASA</span> cargo to the International Space Station for several years. Last week, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> announced that two space tourists would pay to fly on a weeklong trip around the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies are part of a private sector space boom that has restored the United States' position in aerospace technology and exploration. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and other international commercial space companies are also competing with the tech entrepreneurs for business and government customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos, true to his approach in business ventures, is looking far into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The long-term vision is millions of people living and working in space,'' he said Tuesday during a speech at the Satellite 2017 conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make that happen, Blue Origin must take several intermediate steps, he said. It also needs to lower costs for launches by reusing rockets and other equipment, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We ''need to get to a place ultimately where it is much more like commercial airlines,'' Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for satellites, including broadband internet, mapping and other services, have fueled more demand. Analysts said private rocket companies would fill a need to get those satellites into orbit in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin's deal with Eutelsat is a ''definite statement to the industry that Blue Origin will be a viable commercial launch vehicle,'' said Carissa Bryce Christensen, the chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, a consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large crowd to hear Mr. Bezos speak at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Tuesday illustrated renewed enthusiasm about the commercial space industry. Space has long been a pursuit of wealthy investors, and Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have captured the most public attention in recent years for their audacious visions. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is focused on reaching and inhabiting Mars. Blue Origin may be building a fleet of rockets to make deliveries to the moon and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos ''is investing because he wants to transform people's lives with space capabilities, but the expectation has always been that this will be a successful business,'' Ms. Christensen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those ambitions have many doubters who do not see how expensive rocket projects can become profitable. Even with a surge in satellite technologies and perhaps a growing space tourism industry, demand may not be sufficient to cover rocket companies' great costs for research, development and launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You wouldn't get anything done without getting the dreamers out there, but how do you translate those dreams into a profitable business? That's very tricky,'' said Henry Hertzfeld, a research professor at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin, which has more than 1,000 employees, has improved its technology to carry bigger payloads. A few months ago, the company began to court customers, and Eutelsat emerged as an ideal partner because it had experience working with first-time launch vehicles, Mr. Bezos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, named after the astronaut John Glenn, will be manufactured and launched at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is expected to be completed in 2020 and will be used to carry one of Eutelsat's geostationary satellites. No financial details of the partnership with Eutelsat were disclosed. In a video, Mr. Bezos revealed details about the rocket's BE-4 engine and showed how it could carry 50 tons of payload and land on a moving sea barge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their solid engineering approach, and their policy to develop technologies that will form the base of a broad generation of launchers, corresponds to what we expect from our industrial partners,'' Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat's chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos said he was approaching his space project with an abundance of patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like to do things incrementally,'' he said, noting that Blue Origin's mascot is a tortoise. With such high costs and risks with each rocket launch, it is important not to skip steps, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Slow is smooth and smooth is fast,'' said Mr. Bezos, who also owns The <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span> and a clock that will keep time for 10,000 years. ''I've seen this in every endeavor I've been in.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning of Feb. 23, 1987, a couple of dozen subatomic particles known as neutrinos zinged through specially instrumented underground sensors in Japan, Ohio and Russia. The particles had squirted from the core of a collapsing star 163,000 light years away in a small galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud. They were the heralds of doom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On their heels, a couple of hours later came a rising blitzkrieg of light, heat, X-rays, shock waves, and rings and knots of gas and all manner of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum -- all the panoply of a star devouring itself in one of the great cataclysms of nature, a supernova explosion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SN1987A, as it is known, was the nearest supernova to be discovered since humans started using telescopes, and it sent astronomers rushing to observatories in Chile and Australia where the star was dying straight overhead. Since then, it has been studied by telescopes in space and on every continent, including Antarctica. And the show is still going on, as can be seen in new images obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope and released in honor of the event's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's the shredded star in the center, the circumstellar ring that looks like a string of pearls,'' Robert Kirshner, a longtime Harvard professor and currently science program director for the Moore Foundation, who has studied the supernova for 30 years, mused in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Time-lapse of SN 1987A and its ring Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its peak, SN1987A was radiating more energy than 100 million suns and was visible to the naked eye. Among other things, astronomers traced the explosion to a blue supergiant star that has now disappeared. The observations have allowed scientists to recreate the steps by which it started coming apart tens of thousands of years before the final cataclysm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data confirmed that most of the light from the supernova was caused by the decay of radioactive cobalt produced as the star shrank catastrophically and then rebounded even more catastrophically in a thermonuclear fury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another mystery remains. According to theory, the emission of neutrinos should have meant that the core of the doomed star was collapsing into a neutron star, a ball about the size of Manhattan but dense as an atomic nucleus, whose magnetic fields spinning and sweeping space like a lighthouse beam produce the clocklike signals known as pulsars. But there is no sign that a neutron star has been seen yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've looked, but we don't see any little dot in the center,'' Dr. Kirshner said. Maybe it is hidden by dust, or maybe enough star material fell back onto the star to nudge it into collapsing into a black hole. The end of the story of this star is still unwritten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most interesting thing to test is whether we understand correctly how a star explodes and which elements it forms, by looking directly at the shredded star,'' Dr. Kirshner said. ''After all, you and the Earth are made of five-billion-year-old supernova debris.''</p>

<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the ambitious rocket company headed by Elon Musk, wants to send a couple of tourists around the moon and back to Earth before the end of next year. If they manage that feat, the passengers would be the first humans to venture that far into space in more than 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk made the announcement on Monday in a telephone news conference. He said two private individuals approached the company to see if <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would be willing to send them on a weeklong cruise, which would fly past the surface of the moon -- but not land -- and continue outward before gravity turned the spacecraft around and brought it back to Earth for a landing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This would do a long loop around the moon,'' Mr. Musk said. The company is aiming to launch this moon mission in late 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two people would spend about a week inside one of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Dragon 2 capsules, launched on <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon Heavy rocket. The spacecraft would be automated, but the travelers would undergo training for emergencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk did not say how much the travelers would pay for the ride. ''A little bit more than the cost of a crewed mission to the space station would be,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Falcon Heavy itself has a list price of $90 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the trip appears to be within the technical capabilities of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, industry observers wondered whether the company could pull it off as quickly as Mr. Musk indicated. ''Dates are not <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s strong suit,'' said Mary Lynne Dittmar, executive director of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration. The Dragon 2 and Falcon Heavy are years behind schedule and have yet to fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It strikes me as risky,'' Dr. Dittmar said, adding that autonomous systems are not infallible. ''I find it extraordinary that these sorts of announcements are being made when <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has yet to get crew from the ground to low-Earth orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a crewless Dragon capsule taking cargo to the International Space Station aborted its rendezvous because of a glitch. It successfully arrived a day later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said the two would-be private space travelers wished to remain anonymous for now. He declined to describe them, except to say they knew each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven space tourists have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly on Russian Soyuz rockets to visit the International Space Station, which is about 200 miles above the Earth's surface. This would be a much more distant trip. The moon is about a quarter million miles away, and the trajectory would take the capsule 300,000 to 400,000 miles from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No astronauts have ventured beyond low-Earth orbit since the last of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Apollo moon landings in 1972. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is working on a rocket, the Space Launch System, and a capsule, Orion, that would be capable of taking astronauts to deep space once again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that first launch, without anyone on board, is scheduled for late next year, taking a path similar to what Mr. Musk has proposed for his space tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> announced it is looking at the possibility of putting astronauts on the first flight, but officials say that would probably delay the launch to 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would use for the voyage is more powerful than its current Falcon 9 workhorse, but not as large as <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Musk announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011, he said it would fly in 2013. The maiden flight is now scheduled for this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has a contract to take <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronauts to the International Space Station using the Dragon 2 capsule launched on the Falcon 9 rocket. That program has also encountered delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is scheduled to launch a crewless test flight this year and take its few <span class="companylink">NASA</span> passengers next spring, although a report by the <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> has cast doubt that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would be able to do it that quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> has financed much of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s spacecraft development, and Mr. Musk said the agency has priority. If <span class="companylink">NASA</span> wants to put its astronauts on the Falcon Heavy's first moon flight, he said, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will comply. But the Falcon Heavy has not been through <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s rigorous reviews to be judged safe for astronauts.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more than 160 swear words in Andy Weir's sci-fi thriller, ''The Martian,'' including two memorably deployed F-words in the novel's first three sentences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profanity did not strike Mr. Weir as excessive when he wrote the book nearly a decade ago. After all, the story's narrator, an astronaut named Mark Watney, is stranded alone on Mars with a dwindling supply of food and a rescue mission that is four years away -- circumstances that warrant constant cursing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But shortly after the book came out, Mr. Weir started hearing from a subset of readers who objected to the obscenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, 'Man I'd love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there's so much profanity in it that we can't really do that,''' said Mr. Weir, 44, who is cheerful, hyper-analytical and casually profane, much like his protagonist. ''It's hard to get that by a school board.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the four-letter words, ''The Martian'' is a science teacher's dream text. It's a gripping survival story that hinges on the hero's ability to solve a series of complex problems, using his knowledge of physics, chemistry, astronomy and math, in order to stay alive on a hostile planet. (The <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span> called the novel ''an advertisement for the importance of STEM education.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After getting dozens of inquiries from teachers, Mr. Weir, who describes himself as ''a lifelong space nerd,'' asked his publisher, Crown, if they could release a cleaned-up edition of the book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The novel was pretty easy to amend, by simply replacing the foul language with tamer words like ''screwed,'' ''jerk'' and ''crap'' (Mr. Weir said there were ''occasional squabbles'' when he tried to lobby the censors to keep some of the less offensive swear words in.) A kid-friendly version came out last year, and it is now being used to help teach science in classrooms around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Synergy Quantum Academy, a public charter high school in South Los Angeles, students are conducting experiments based on the novel. In physics class, students will build miniature solar-powered cars, and during astronomy next month, they will try to grow potatoes as Watney did, using a chamber modeled on <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Lunar Plant Growth Chamber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighth graders at Oak Middle School in Los Alamitos, Calif., are following a yearlong curriculum based on ''The Martian,'' with lesson plans that use dramatic moments in the narrative to illustrate concepts like Newton's laws of motion, chemical reactions and spacecraft engineering. In a science class at Northwestern High School in Mellette, S.D., sophomores are using the novel as a jumping-off point for some hands-on experiments, like splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really exciting for them to see the connection between the novel and the science they're learning,'' said Denise Clemens, a science teacher at Northwestern. ''Hopefully we're not going to blow anything up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her students seem happy to have an alternative to dry science textbooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a really good way to understand ionic compounds and bonds and all the things you can do with chemistry,'' Jarret Haven, 16, said of studying ''The Martian.'' ''It's really opened up my mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Weir and his publisher, getting the book into schools opens up a lucrative new market that could turn ''The Martian,'' which was already a blockbuster that sold several million copies, into a perennial best seller that guarantees a built-in audience every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weir did not set out to write a science textbook. A college dropout and former software engineer who is fascinated by space exploration, Mr. Weir started writing ''The Martian'' in 2009, mainly to entertain himself. The story grew out of a thought experiment, when Mr. Weir began imagining what a scientifically feasible manned mission to Mars would look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story took shape as Mr. Weir tried to work out what it would take to get to Mars, and how to keep a stranded astronaut alive on the planet (the creative use of duct tape is key).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oftentimes, when I was double-checking the math, I would discover problems that I hadn't thought of that Watney would run into,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wrote computer software to work out what the constant thrust trajectories would be for the spaceship's ion engine, and studied <span class="companylink">NASA</span> satellite images to map out Watney's treacherous 3,200-plus kilometer course across Mars in a rover. He also calculated how many calories Watney would need to stay alive, how much water he would need to grow potatoes, and how he could manufacture water out of oxygen and hydrazine, a compound used for rocket fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weir had failed to sell an earlier attempt at a novel, so rather than trying to get ''The Martian'' published, he serialized it for free on his website. Some of his fans urged him to list it on Amazon, and he began selling it for 99 cents. He quickly sold 35,000 copies, and started getting inquiries from publishers and agents. Crown bought the novel and published it in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A feature film adaptation, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon as Watney, came out the next year and grossed more than $630 million worldwide. The novel sold more than three million copies, and has racked up more than 29,500 reviews on Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crown has printed nearly 30,000 copies of the classroom edition, which comes with a teacher's guide that lists discussion questions and activities and includes an interview with Mr. Weir about the science behind the story. Next month, Mr. Weir will address science teachers at the <span class="companylink">National Science Teachers Association</span>'s conference in Los Angeles, and his publisher will give away around 500 copies of the classroom edition of the ''The Martian.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Beck, a science teacher at Oak Middle School, was one of the teachers who lobbied Mr. Weir for a sanitized version of the story. After he first read ''The Martian'' two years ago, Mr. Beck immediately wanted to create a curriculum based on the novel. ''I thought, I could teach all of my eighth-grade physical science out of this book,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He proposed using the novel in his class to the school's principal, who loved the idea but thought the foul language could be a problem. They approached the district school board to see if they could assign the novel to students, and were turned down. (They even considered buying copies of the novel and redacting the swear words by hand with markers, but decided against it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beck then emailed Mr. Weir and later, his publisher, and asked if they had considered releasing a PG edition for students. At that point, similar requests were piling up. Crown wanted to wait until after the movie adaptation came out, to avoid confusing retailers and readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Broadway Books, a Crown imprint, published the school edition in 2016, Mr. Beck created a yearlong curriculum for the school's 380 eighth graders, who each got a copy of the book. So far, the students have been enthusiastic, and many have finished the novel ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some teachers are skeptical that students need to be shielded from the profanity in ''The Martian.'' Marc Montalbano, an English teacher at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, said he was using the original version of ''The Martian'' with his seniors, who are also drawing on the text for science research projects. Watney's swearing makes him seem more relatable as a character and helps offset the heavy science, Mr. Montalbano said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nora Groft, a high school English teacher at Northwestern, said she taught the classroom edition of ''The Martian,'' but told her students that a version with more adult language was available, too, and that the curse words might be appropriate, given the context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Imagine if you were stranded on Mars,'' she said. ''Do you think you'd say, 'Goshdarnit'?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not just one, but seven Earth-size planets that could potentially harbor life have been identified orbiting a tiny star not too far away, offering the first realistic opportunity to search for signs of alien life outside the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planets orbit a dwarf star named Trappist-1, about 40 light-years, or 235 trillion miles, from Earth. That is quite close in cosmic terms, and by happy accident, the orientation of the orbits of the seven planets allows them to be studied in great detail.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One or more of the exoplanets in this new system could be at the right temperature to be awash in oceans of water, astronomers said, based on the distance of the planets from the dwarf star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the first time so many planets of this kind are found around the same star,'' Michael Gillon, an astronomer at the University of Liege in Belgium and the leader of an international team that has been observing Trappist-1, said during a telephone news conference organized by the journal Nature, which published the findings on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists could even discover compelling evidence of aliens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that we have made a crucial step toward finding if there is life out there,'' said Amaury H. M. J. Triaud, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge in England and another member of the research team. ''Here, if life managed to thrive and releases gases similar to that we have on Earth, then we will know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cool red dwarfs are the most common type of star, so astronomers are likely to find more planetary systems like that around Trappist-1 in the coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can just imagine how many worlds are out there that have a shot to becoming a habitable ecosystem,'' Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's science mission directorate, said during a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> news conference on Wednesday. ''Are we alone out there? We're making a step forward with this -- a leap forward, in fact -- towards answering that question.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telescopes on the ground now and the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit will be able to discern some of the molecules in the planetary atmospheres. The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch next year, will peer at the infrared wavelengths of light, ideal for studying Trappist-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparisons among the different conditions of the seven will also be revealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Trappist-1 planets make the search for life in the galaxy imminent,'' said Sara Seager, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not a member of the research team. ''For the first time ever, we don't have to speculate. We just have to wait and then make very careful observations and see what is in the atmospheres of the Trappist planets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the planets all turn out to be lifeless, scientists will have learned more about what keeps life from flourishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers always knew other stars must have planets, but until a couple of decades ago, they had not been able to spot them. Now they have confirmed more than 3,400, according to the Open Exoplanet Catalog. (An exoplanet is a planet around a star other than the sun.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors of the Nature paper include Didier Queloz, one of the astronomers who discovered in 1995 the first known exoplanet around a sunlike star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Trappist planets are about the size of Earth -- give or take 25 percent in diameter -- the star is very different from our sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trappist-1, named after a robotic telescope in the Atacama Desert of Chile that the astronomers initially used to study the star, is what astronomers call an ''ultracool dwarf,'' with only one-twelfth the mass of the sun and a surface temperature of 4,150 degrees Fahrenheit, much cooler than the 10,000 degrees radiating from the sun. Trappist is a shortening of Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> news conference, Dr. Gillon gave a simple analogy: If our sun were the size of a basketball, Trappist-1 would be a golf ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the last few years, scientists looking for life elsewhere in the galaxy have focused on finding Earth-size planets around sun-like stars. But it is hard to pick out the light of a planet from the glare of a bright star. Small dim dwarfs are much easier to study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-size planet around Proxima Centauri, the closest star at 4.24 light-years away. That discovery was made using a different technique that does not allow for study of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trappist-1 periodically dimmed noticeably, indicating that a planet might be passing in front of the star, blocking part of the light. From the shape of the dips, the astronomers calculate the size of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trappist-1's light dipped so many times that the astronomers concluded, in research reported last year, that there were at least three planets around the star. Telescopes from around the world then also observed Trappist-1, as did the Spitzer Space Telescope of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spitzer observed Trappist-1 nearly around the clock for 20 days, capturing 34 transits. Together with the ground observations, it let the scientists calculate not three planets, but seven. The planets are too small and too close to the star to be photographed directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All seven are very close to the dwarf star, circling more quickly than the planets in our solar system. The innermost completes an orbit in just 1.5 days. The farthest one completes an orbit in about 20 days. That makes the planetary system more like the moons of Jupiter than a larger planetary system like our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They form a very compact system,'' Dr. Gillon said, ''the planets being pulled close to each other and very close to the star.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the orbital periods of the inner six suggest that the planets formed farther away from the star and then were all gradually pulled inward, Dr. Gillon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the planets are so close to a cool star, their surfaces could be at the right temperatures to have water flow, considered one of the essential ingredients for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth, fifth and sixth planets orbit in the star's ''habitable zone,'' where the planets could sport oceans. So far that is just speculation, but by measuring which wavelengths of light are blocked by the planet, scientists will be able to figure out what gases float in the atmospheres of the seven planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, they have confirmed for the two innermost planets that they are not enveloped in hydrogen. That means they are rocky like Earth, ruling out the possibility that they were mini-Neptune gas planets that are prevalent around many other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the planets are so close to Trappist-1, they have quite likely become ''gravitationally locked'' to the star, always with one side of the planets facing the star, much as it is always the same side of Earth's moon facing Earth. That would mean one side would be warmer, but an atmosphere would distribute heat, and the scientists said that would not be an insurmountable obstacle for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a person standing on one of the planets, it would be a dim environment, with perhaps only about one two-hundredth the light that we see from the sun on Earth, Dr. Triaud said. (That would still be brighter than the moon at night.) The star would be far bigger. On Trappist-1f, the fifth planet, the star would be three times as wide as the sun seen from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the color of the star, ''we had a debate about that,'' Dr. Triaud said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the scientists expected a deep red, but with most of the star's light emitted at infrared wavelengths and out of view of human eyes, perhaps a person would ''see something more salmon-y,'' Dr. Triaud said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> released a poster illustrating what the sky of the fourth planet might look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If observations reveal oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, that could point to photosynthesis of plants -- although not conclusively. But oxygen together with methane, ozone and carbon dioxide, particularly in certain proportions, ''would tell us that there is life with 99 percent confidence,'' Dr. Gillon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers expect that a few decades of technological advances are needed before similar observations can be made of Earthlike planets around larger, brighter sunlike stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Triaud said that if there is life around Trappist-1, ''then it's good we didn't wait too long.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there isn't, then we have learned something quite deep about where life can emerge,'' he continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery might also mean that scientists who have been searching for radio signals from alien civilizations might also have been searching in the wrong places if most habitable planets orbit dwarfs, which live far longer than larger stars like the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., is using the Allen Telescope Array, a group of 42 radio dishes in California, to scrutinize 20,000 red dwarfs. ''This result is kind of a justification for that project,'' said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're looking for complex biology -- intelligent aliens that might take a long time to evolve from pond scum -- older could be better,'' Dr. Shostak said. ''It seems a good bet that the majority of clever beings populating the universe look up to see a dim, reddish sun hanging in their sky. And at least they wouldn't have to worry about sun block.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a crisis brewing in the cosmos, or perhaps in the community of cosmologists. The universe seems to be expanding too fast, some astronomers say. ¶ Recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies don't agree with a hard-won ''standard model'' of the cosmos that has prevailed for the past two decades. ¶ The latest result shows a 9 percent discrepancy in the value of a long-sought number called the Hubble constant, which describes how fast the universe is expanding. But in a measure of how precise cosmologists think their science has become, this small mismatch has fostered a debate about just how well we know the cosmos. ¶ ''If it is real, we will learn new physics,'' said Wendy Freedman of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>, who has spent most of her career charting the size and growth of the universe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble constant, named after Edwin Hubble, the Mount Wilson and Carnegie Observatories astronomer who discovered that the universe is expanding, has ever given astronomers fits. In an expanding universe, the farther something is away from you, the faster it is receding. Hubble's constant tells by how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But measuring it requires divining the distances of lights in the sky -- stars and even whole galaxies that we can never visit or recreate in the lab. The strategy since Hubble's day has been to find so-called standard candles, stars or whole galaxies whose distances can be calculated by how bright they look from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the calibrators themselves need to be calibrated, which has led to a rickety chain of assumptions and measurements in which small errors and disagreements -- about, say, how much dust is interfering with observations -- can build up to cosmic proportions. Only three decades ago, renowned astronomers could not agree on whether the universe was 10 billion or 20 billion years old. Now everybody has settled on its age as about 13.8 billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using a new generation of instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have steadily whittled down the uncertainty in the Hubble constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting Closer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, a team led by Dr. Freedman reported a value of 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec (about 3.3 million lightyears), in the galumphing units astronomers prefer. It meant that for every 3.3 million lightyears a galaxy was farther away from us, it was moving 72 kilometers a second faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble's original estimate was much higher, at 500 in the same units of measurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Freedman's result had an error margin that left it happily consistent with other more indirect calculations, that had gotten a slightly slower and lower value of 67 for the Hubble constant. Those were derived from studies of microwaves emitted and still lingering in the sky from the the primordial Big Bang fireball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, in recent years, astronomers have settled on a recipe for the universe that is as black and as decadent as a double dark chocolate chunk brownie. The universe consists of roughly 5 percent atomic matter by weight, 27 percent mysterious dark matter and 68 percent of the even more mysterious dark energy that is speeding up the cosmic expansion. Never mind that we don't know exactly what all this dark stuff is. Astronomers have a good theory about how it behaves, and that has allowed them to tell a plausible story about how the universe evolved from when it was a trillionth of a second old until today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the Hubble precision has gotten seemingly better, and the universe might be in trouble again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer a team led by Adam Riess of <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span> and the Space Telescope Science Institute, using the Hubble Space Telescope and the giant Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and supernova explosions as the ultimate distance markers, got a value of 73 plus or minus only 2.4 percent for the elusive constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That made waves because it meant that, if true, the Hubble constant as observed today was now clearly incompatible with a result of the lower slower value of 67 inferred from data obtained in 2013 by the European Planck spacecraft of relic radiation from the Big Bang. The Planck mission observations that show the universe when it was only 380,000 years old are considered the gold standard of cosmology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the standard cosmic recipe might now need to be modified -- for example, to account for a new species of subatomic particles streaming through space from the Big Bang -- depends on whom you talk to. Some say it is too soon to get excited about new physics sneaking through such a small discrepancy in a field noted for controversy. With more data and better understanding of statistical uncertainties, the discrepancy might disappear, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No explanation I know of is less ugly than the problem,'' Lawrence M. Krauss, a theorist at Arizona State, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say this could be the beginning of something big. David Spergel, a cosmologist at Princeton and the Simons Foundation, called the discrepancy ''very intriguing,'' but said he was not yet convinced that this was the signature of new physics. Michael S. Turner of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> said, ''If the discrepancy is real, this could be a disruption of the current highly successful standard model of cosmology and just what the younger generation wants -- a chance for big discoveries, new insights and breakthroughs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Riess and his colleague Stefano Casertano got roughly the same answer of 73later last summer, strengthening the claim for a mismatch of Hubble constants. They used early data from the European spacecraft GAIA, which is measuring the distances of more than a billion stars by triangulation, thus allowing astronomers to skip some of the lower rungs on the distance ladder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They calculated that the odds of this mismatch being a statistical fluke were less than one part in a hundred -- which might sound good in poker but not in physics, which requires odds of less than one in a million to cement a claim of a discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a potentially serious issue,'' said Alex Filippenko, a University of California astronomer who is part of the team. ''In this line of research the devil is in the details. And after getting the details right, we're left with a major puzzle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Efstathiou, of the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span> and one of the leaders of the Planck mission responsible for its cosmological analysis, said Dr. Riess and his team had underestimated the errors in their measurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So, in summary, I think that the Planck results are secure,'' he wrote in an email. ''They,'' he said, referring to the other astronomers, ''may be right and we have to modify their standard model, but the evidence looks weak to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Riess and his colleagues have stood by their work, however, and the plot thickened further in December when a group called H0LiCOW (don't ask) from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, reported its own value of 72 for the Hubble constant, also inconsistent with the Planck space mission's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by Sherry Suyu of Max Planck, the group measured the delays experienced by light rays from five distant flickering quasars as they followed different paths around massive galaxies on the way from Out There to us. . The technique, they say, depends only on geometry and Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, making it independent of other assumptions about dust or the makeup of stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a group known as BOSS, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, came up with a Hubble constant of about 68, based on how 1.5 million galaxies were clustered in space and time, but it used data from the cosmic microwave background for calibration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Comes Next?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is wiggle room, Dr. Riess and others say, for both the modern and the primordial results to be right, because Planck measures the Hubble constant only indirectly as one of several parameters in the standard model of the universe. Other parameters could be tweaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is where new physics might come in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely candidates to fill the gap, Dr. Riess said, might be a new form of the ghostly particles called neutrinos, already known to be abundant in the cosmos. They come in three types that can change into one another as they traverse space; some physicists have suggested there could be a fourth kind, called sterile neutrinos, that don't interact with anything at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their discovery could unlock new realms in particle physics and perhaps shed light, so to speak, on the quest to understand the dark matter that suffuses space and provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is that the most popular version of dark energy -- known as the cosmological constant, invented by Einstein 100 years ago and then rejected as a blunder -- might have to be replaced in the cosmological model by a more virulent and controversial form known as phantom energy, which could cause the universe to eventually expand so fast that even atoms would be torn apart in a Big Rip billions of years from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very interesting tension,'' Dr. Riess said. ''This is why we play the game. We look for something not fitting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''Clues about the dark sector or about fundamental physics are in play.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the age of ''precision cosmology,'' and while everybody agrees that it is still too soon to tell, the avalanche of data from GAIA and the coming James Webb Space Telescope is just beginning, Dr. Freedman said. In the next few years she hopes the Hubble constant can be measured to 1 percent accuracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And that's what makes it interesting -- this is feasible, and a lot of work is now ongoing that will allow us to resolve this within the next couple of years,'' she said. ''It's what makes me want to work on this again!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the situation reminded her of the late 1990s, when discrepant distances to distant supernova explosions led to the discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating under the influence of dark energy. Dr. Riess won a Nobel Prize for his part in that, and dark energy took its place in cosmic orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not quite 'déjà vu,''' he wrote in an email, ''but it's funny that whenever my colleagues and I look at the contemporary universe with our radar guns, it's expanding too fast for the contemporary expectations!''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Even as he was preparing for the biggest struggle of his life, leading Britain in its fight against Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill had something else on his mind: extraterrestrials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a newly unearthed essay sent to his publisher on Oct. 16, 1939 -- just weeks after Britain entered World War II and Churchill became part of the wartime cabinet -- and later revised, he was pondering the likelihood of life on other planets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill, who went on to become prime minister during much of World War II and again from 1951 to 1955, was so enthralled by the subject that he even ordered a suspected sighting of an unidentified flying object by the <span class="companylink">Royal Air Force</span> to be kept a secret for 50 years to avoid ''mass panic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an 11-page essay titled ''Are We Alone in the Universe?'' the statesman showed powers of reason ''like a scientist,'' said Mario Livio, an astrophysicist who read the rarely seen draft and wrote about it in an article published on Wednesday in Nature magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most amazing thing is that he started this essay when Europe was on the brink of war and there he is, musing about a question about a scientific topic that is really a question out of curiosity,'' he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill first defines what life is, then details the requirements for life to exist and progressively expands his reasoning to the existence of life in other solar systems, Mr. Livio said. ''He's really thinking about this,'' Mr. Livio said, ''and though he didn't have all the knowledge at hand, he thinks about this with the logic of a scientist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill's interest in science stemmed from his early years as an army officer in British-ruled India, where he had crates of books, including Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species,'' shipped to him by his mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He later became friends, at least for a time, with the writer H.G. Wells, whose novel ''The War of the Worlds,'' about Martians invading Britain, had been adapted by Orson Welles for a famous <span class="companylink">CBS</span> radio broadcast in 1938 -- a year before Churchill wrote his article. (Churchill once said Wells's ''The Time Machine'' was one of the books he would like to take with him to Purgatory.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill argued that it was probable that extraterrestrial life existed somewhere in the universe. This was years before Frank Drake, the American astronomer and astrophysicist, presented in 1961 his theory about the number of communicative civilizations in the cosmos. ''It is astonishing that Churchill wasn't a scientist and yet he showed such an interest in science,'' Mr. Livio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manuscript was passed on to the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Mo., the site of Churchill's famed 1946 Iron Curtain speech, in the 1980s by Wendy Reves, the wife of Churchill's publisher, Emery Reves. It had been overlooked for years until Timothy Riley, who became the museum's director last year, stumbled upon it recently. Soon after news of the discovery, two other copies were found in a separate archive in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the article was sent to Mr. Reves in 1939, it was not published. Churchill had revised it a number of times in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his article, Churchill wrote: ''I am not sufficiently conceited to think that my sun is the only one with a family of planets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I, for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilization here that I am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures,'' he wrote, ''or that we are the highest type of mental and physical development which has ever appeared in the vast compass of space and time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Largely self-educated in the sciences, Churchill had boundless curiosity for practically anything, an attitude he once described as ''picking up a few things as I went along.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wrote about 30 million words in his lifetime, including wartime speeches, an African travelogue, a book on oil painting, a lengthy memoir, and even an essay on an imagined invasion of Russia when he was just 15. For his body of work, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welding an active imagination with scientific thought, Churchill produced a few madcap ideas -- which he called ''funnies'' -- that he actually championed while he was prime minister, as a means to defeat Nazi Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was Operation Habakkuk, an imagined fleet of aircraft carriers made from wood pulp and ice to fight German U-boats in the mid-Atlantic. Then there was the Great Panjandrum, an enormous, rocket-propelled wheel packed with explosives. Churchill even invented a green velvet ''siren suit'' to be put on in a hurry during air raids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While none of these ideas came into being (the giant wheel having run amok in the testing stage), science was not just a hobby for Churchill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was the first prime minister to hire a science adviser. Frederick Lindemann, a physicist, became Churchill's ''on tap'' expert and once described him as a ''scientist who had missed his vocation,'' said Andrew Nahum, who organized an exhibition on Churchill and science at the <span class="companylink">Science Museum in London</span>. He found a separate copy of the essay in the Churchill Archives Center at the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill also met regularly with scientists such as Bernard Lovell, the father of radio astronomy and the Lovell telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Churchill presided over a culture that encouraged technological development,'' Mr. Nahum said. Churchill had such a genuine interest in science, he added, that as chancellor of the Exchequer in prewar Britain, he complained to a friend of having to draft the budget instead of reading a book on quantum physics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During World War I, when he was lord of the admiralty and later secretary of state for air and war, he encouraged military aviation, chemical warfare and tanks. During World War II, which he called in his memoirs ''The Wizard War,'' he supported the development of radar, rockets and Britain's nuclear program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill founded in 1958 the British equivalent of the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> at Cambridge -- Churchill College -- which has since produced 32 Nobel Prize winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interwar period, Churchill wrote numerous scientific articles, including one called ''Death Rays'' and another titled ''Are There Men on the Moon?'' In 1924, he published a text asking readers ''Shall We All Commit Suicide?'' in which he speculated that technological advances could lead to the creation of a small bomb that was powerful enough to destroy an entire town.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch was high-risk because the satellites, released in rapid-fire fashion every few seconds from a single rocket as it traveled at 17,000 miles an hour, could collide with one another if ejected into the wrong path.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have spent months figuring out how to make an adapter, which will release these small babies into space one after another,'' said Pallava Bagla, science editor for NDTV, a cable news station. ''Now, all of them are in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's launch was being watched closely by firms that place satellites in orbit, because India's space agency charges substantially less than its competitors in Europe and North America, said C. Uday Bhaskar, the director of the Society for Policy Studies, a public policy research group based in New Delhi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-eight of the 104 satellites released on Wednesday were tiny, weighing about 10 pounds. Called Doves, they belong to <span class="companylink">Planet Labs</span>, a private company based in San Francisco that sells data to governments and commercial entities, and they constituted the largest satellite constellation ever launched into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chairman of the Indian space agency, A. S. Kiran Kumar, has said that commercial fees covered around half of the cost of Wednesday's mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sure the global market will be looking at this pretty closely,'' Mr. Bhaskar said. ''If they can send 90 of them up for $10 million, hypothetically, then just by Moore's Law, next time they should be able to send 120 satellites.'' Moore's Law originated in the semiconductor industry and held that the number of components that could be crammed onto a computer chip would double at regular intervals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous record was set by <span class="companylink">Russia's space agency</span>, which launched 37 satellites into orbit with one rocket in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India is fascinated with world records, and Wednesday's satellite launch prompted a wave of celebratory crowing, some of it aimed at Asian rivals. Many declared it a ''century,'' a term for a cricketing milestone when a single batsman manages to score 100 runs in a single innings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president, Pranab Mukherjee, called it ''a landmark in the history of our space program,'' while Alok Kumar Dubey, a right-wing activist, said on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, ''Look china, pak THIS is Our power.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span> has gained attention in recent years for staging successful missions at very low cost, in part because its scientists are paid less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, India sent a spacecraft to Mars for $74 million, a small fraction of the $671 million the United States spent for a Mars mission that same year, and showing up a regional rival, China, whose own Mars mission failed in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By charging significantly less to launch satellites into space, India could carve out a niche in the $3 billion to $4 billion market for detailed information about climate, topography and defense, Mr. Bhaskar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robbie Schingler, a former NASA scientist and a co-founder of Planet Labs, described himself as ''ecstatic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sequencing needed to be very precise,'' he said. ''It worked perfectly and flawlessly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shri G. Madhavan Nair, a former chairman of India's space program, said newer satellites weigh as little as two pounds, meaning that there is ''no limit'' to the number that can be launched into space at a time -- a trend that he said worried him, as most satellites are operational for only two or three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are all concerned about space debris,'' he said. ''After that, it becomes a dead mass floating in space. Personally, I will not recommend such an increase in the number without a practical purpose.''</p>

Early 1960s: the Cuban missile crisis. 1980s: the Soviet Union's reaction to the ''Star Wars'' defense plan. Now: ''We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years, there's no doubt about that'' -- Stephen K. Bannon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apocalyptic visions are always in fashion, of course; it's just a question of where the end is seen to be coming from. The bellicose statements directed at other countries by our current president and some of his advisers have renewed fears (or, in some quarters, hopes) that we'll bring it about ourselves through all-out war.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trust television to remind us that whatever we do, there's a range of threats completely out of our control that will someday do the job for us. This programming category is a mainstay of a number of cable channels, and its latest iteration can be seen on Saturday when the Science Channel presents ''The Dark Side of the Sun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dark Side,'' a documentary about the inevitable catastrophe that will be caused by a coronal mass ejection -- huge solar winds -- isn't, strictly speaking, apocalyptic. But it's on the spectrum: coronal ejection, mega-volcano, asteroid strike. When Earth is hit by another solar wind like the 1859 Carrington Event (scientists estimate that we're about 50 years overdue), the likely result will be significant, with a long-lasting loss of electric power. Imagine the entire East Coast without any power for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(If you want real apocalypse, cable provides. On Sunday the American Heroes Channel begins the six-part series ''How the World Ends,'' beginning with nuclear war and proceeding through rogue planet and epidemic to alien invasion.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because ''Dark Side'' is on the Science Channel, it balances its scaremongering with reports on two major efforts to study the sun and predict when a massive solar wind is going to hit the Earth. (We couldn't send Ben Affleck up to stop the wind, but we could shut down our power grids and communication systems and ground our airplanes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can only hope that other current trends -- the belittling of climate research and general attacks on the scientific method -- don't derail the construction of a huge solar telescope in Maui or the launch of the first spacecraft that will provide close-up satellite views of the sun. The program doesn't suggest this, though it includes a highly pointed image in the current context: President Obama signing an executive order ''coordinating efforts to prepare the nation for space weather events.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, ''Dark Side'' leaves behind the problem of solar winds and indulges in some pure tabloid-cable fun: pointing out that the sun, according to scientists' best guesses, only has about five billion years to live. As the commentators talk dreamily about nuclear-fusion engines that will carry our descendants to other planets, you can't help wondering whether approaches to diplomacy might be affected by our popular culture's love affair with apocalypse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near-boiling pools of acidic water bubble between odd formations of rocks and minerals: white beehive-shaped mounds of salt, yolk-colored lattices of sulfuric crust, purplish-red crumbles. Nearby, iron-rich rock fans out into flat mushroom shapes. The ground crackles hollowly underfoot and emits the hiss of bubbling liquid. Cones and small mineral chimneys babble from one-holed spouts in alien whispers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it looks like an extraterrestrial scene, this landscape belongs to the Danakil Depression, in a remote northeast region of Ethiopia aptly named Afar, near Eritrea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 100 meters below sea level, the Danakil Depression is one of the world's lowest places. It is also one of the hottest places on Earth, with average daily temperatures of 34.4 degrees Celsius (93.9 degrees Fahrenheit) and only about 100 millimeters of rain each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This volcanic region is known as a geological wonder. Indeed, most of the relatively scant scientific research on the Danakil Depression involves its fantastical geology, not its biology. Now, scientists are studying this area to understand the possibilities of life on other planets and moons, despite the region's political volatility and sporadic violence between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This month, a team of astrobiologists from Europlanet, a consortium of research institutions and companies doing planetary research, returned to study the depression's geology, mineralogy and especially its biology, as an analogue to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felipe Gómez Gómez of the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid led the team's first expedition last spring to study Danakil's extremophiles, microbes that live in extreme conditions. Researchers from Madrid and the University of Bologna and the International Research School of Planetary Sciences, both in Italy, assisted by scientists from the University of Mekelle in Ethiopia, are isolating and identifying the hardy bacteria that thrive in this hostile environment of heat, acidity and salinity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aim is ''to try to know the limits of life and the possibility of such forms of life in other planets like Mars,'' said Dr. Gómez, who is part of the science team of Curiosity, the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> exploration rover that landed on Mars over four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also studied other extremophiles, such as microbes that thrive in the acidic iron-rich <span class="companylink">Río Tinto</span> in southwestern Spain. For that research, he and his colleagues exposed an acidophile to simulated Mars conditions, described in a 2010 paper in the journal Icarus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowledge from Danakil could be applied to Mars missions. Studying Danakil's microbes is ''a way to train ourselves to identify different forms of life for astrobiological exploration,'' Dr. Gómez said. While Mars today has subfreezing temperatures, its origins are volcanic and might be similar to the early history of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a broader goal of exploring ways to identify signs of life in extreme environments. ''What is life? What are the limits of life? Scientists don't agree on what is life,'' Dr. Gómez said. ''If we find life on Mars, would we be able to recognize it? We don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Danakil Depression, a rift valley stretching from the Dallol volcano in Ethiopia to the salt plains of Lake Assal in Djibouti, lies at the convergence of three tectonic plates that are slowly separating. As the earth pulls apart and thins over millenniums, the land sinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of years ago, the larger Danakil Desert was part of the Red Sea. But volcanic eruptions formed rock barriers and created an inland sea that eventually evaporated in the intense heat. Vast salt flats and salt lakes remain and are still mined by the nomadic Afar tribes, who transport salt slabs from Danakil by camel caravan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallol, which means disintegration in the Afar language, is the section that is home to colorful, otherworldly formations. Here, magma heats groundwater, which wells up and dissolves salt, potash and other minerals when emerging through hot springs. Brine evaporates, leaving crusty formations colored by minerals, iron and salt-thriving halophile algae to create this multicolored scenery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some pools of water reach 90 degrees Celsius. The combination of heat, high acidity and sulfur concentrations causes bright yellow chimneys to form. Other pools of water heated to 40 degrees Celsius take on a turquoise hue from copper salts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europlanet researchers last year took water samples from salt chimneys, blue and red pools, and yellow and brown crust. Although halophiles -- microbes that thrive in saline conditions -- have been identified in Dallol, this new research is the first to focus on microbes thriving in extreme acidity and heat, in addition to salinity, Dr. Gómez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers are isolating bacteria and their DNA and also doing genetic sequencing to identify the bacteria. Among them are chemolithotrophs -- micro-organisms that acquire energy from inorganic compounds -- that were found in the hot water on the mineral chimneys. These microbes do not require sunlight for energy and are usually found in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents on the seafloor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These simple organisms can survive with a ''very small battery,'' and were probably among the first bacteria on Earth, Dr. Gómez said. ''That is what makes them so interesting from an astrobiological point of view.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chemolithotrophs can use inorganic reduced compounds -- like sulfide, elemental sulfur, hydrogen and ammonia -- as energy sources, and can grow without organic compounds and light. Scientists believe this kind of metabolism happens only with prokaryotes, microbes without a nucleus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sulfur is abundant in Dallol because the area was covered by the sea ages ago. Here, sulfur vapor steams from chimneys on the ground. In dark submarine depths, sulfur can be the main energy source for certain bacteria living far from sunlight. In Dallol, these sources of sulfur are within arm's reach on the Earth's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are still studying their first samples from Danakil, but ''we know there is life,'' Dr. Gomez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter's expedition will focus on bacteria's relationship with the atmosphere. Researchers will set up weather stations to record wind, temperature, humidity and more, ''to study the environment completely, like what Curiosity does on Mars,'' Dr. Gómez said. In this case, though, scientists will not have to leave Earth to do so.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An asteroid is a smaller-than-a-planet rock orbiting in the inner solar system. A meteor is the streak of light of a space rock plunging into the atmosphere, and a meteorite is the remnant of space rock that survives the fiery descent and comes to rest on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, one might think that meteorites that fall on Earth ought to be just like the asteroids that pass through Earth's neighborhood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's what everybody would have expected,'' said Philipp R. Heck, the curator in charge for the meteorite and physical geology collections at the <span class="companylink">Field Museum of Natural History</span> in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists were surprised almost a decade ago when they discovered that the most plentiful types of meteorites they had collected and studied on Earth were actually not common in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published Monday by the journal Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Heck says it has uncovered part of the explanation. Mineralogical evidence in some meteorites had already pointed to a cataclysmic collision in the asteroid belt about 466 million years ago -- long before dinosaurs, when multicellular animals were still fairly new. (Dr. Heck estimated that any skywatchers back then would have seen about 100 times as many shooting stars as crisscross the night sky today.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Heck and his colleagues wanted to examine meteorites that landed on Earth before that, and for that they looked at ancient limestone from Russia -- one-time sediment of a seafloor transformed to rock -- that was about a million years older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They dissolved almost 600 pounds of rock to extract 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite. The crystals persist unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, and from the mix of elements in the crystals, the scientists could tell that 41 of them came from space and what types of asteroids they were once part of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mix of meteorites was very different. Back then, more than a third of them belonged to a type known as primitive achondrites; today, less than half a percent of them are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really inventive, their approach,'' said Tasha L. Dunn, a geology professor at Colby College in Maine who studies meteorites and who was not involved in the research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings fits in with the new understanding that a mix of meteorites is determined more by the history of collisions in the asteroid belt rather than by the mix of asteroids whose orbits around the sun are close to Earth's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It opens new roads of research,'' Pierre Vernazza, a researcher at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille, France, who first noted the discrepancy between asteroids and meteorites in 2008, said of the new paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, many of the achondrites then came from Vesta, a large asteroid that suffered a powerful impact about a billion years ago. But then there are other achondrites that did not. ''In the case of the other achondrites, we don't have any well-known source so far,'' Dr. Vernazza said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Back in his days as a test pilot at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Gus Grissom had a message for his wife, Betty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I die, have a party,'' he said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betty Grissom never did have that party. But on Friday, as for the past 25 years, there was a solemn observance at the little-known memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster. Mr. Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training mission on Jan. 27, 1967. Mr. Grissom was 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Grissom, 89, was at the memorial again on Friday, wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors. She joined old friends, family members, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials and veterans, among them Charlie Duke, who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing. With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington, the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the ceremony, candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families, including Cody Grissom, 22, a pilot, who is completing his last year at his grandfather's alma mater, <span class="companylink">Purdue University</span>. Representatives from the Navy, the Air Force and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> spoke, and a Navy bugler performed taps after the sun went down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is important that Challenger and Columbia are remembered, and that Apollo 1 is remembered,'' said the Kennedy Space Center director, Robert D. Cabana. ''And that we take those steps that create an environment where everyone has a voice, that we really work to ensure the success and the safety of the crew as we continue to explore and move beyond our planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Grissom said this year's ceremony was probably her last. It coincided with a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> tribute exhibit about Apollo 1 at the Kennedy Space Center, which she, like many, thought was long overdue. ''I thought this is probably a good time to call it quits with them finally getting a memorial of some kind,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's event drew around 150 people, one of the largest crowds ever for a memorial that few people knew of unless they were related to an astronaut or were a die-hard space fan. ''We need heroes today, and these were heroes,'' said one such fan, Robert Pearlman, an American space historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People from all over the world traveled to the memorial, among them Masato Maruyama, 65, who has come for the past 10 years from Tokyo. He brought a big bottle of sake to share with the family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maruyama said Mr. Grissom reminded him of his father, who was in the Japanese Navy. He remembers just where he was when the fire occurred. ''It's not the distance -- it's in here,'' he said, pointing to his heart. ''I'm just one of hundreds of thousands. Apollo counted a lot not just for Americans, but human beings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the launch platform is crumbling like a concrete Greek ruin, and stenciled with an eerie ''Abandon in Place,'' the site was decorated with three red-white-and-blue floral wreaths brought by the Grissom family. A bagpiper stood ready and Ms. Grissom sat front and center. She was treated as the event's grande dame as people lined up to speak with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want you to know it is such an honor,'' said Shirley Brown, whose shop provided the wreaths. ''The first time you walked in my shop and said, 'I'm Betty Grissom,' I thought Queen Elizabeth had walked in. You never went down, you fought all the way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never quit,'' Ms. Grissom agreed, in the kind of taciturn response her astronaut husband might have offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many years after the accident, two space buffs, Bob Castro and Mark Pinchell, started going out to the site of the fire, which is on Air Force property, in their own private tribute. One year, they bumped into each other, and came up with the idea of doing something bigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just two space geeks who were going to Pad 34 and doing their own separate ceremonies,'' said Mark Grissom, 63, who was 13 when his father died. ''They met at the pad and decided to invite the families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grissoms were the first astronaut family to become involved. Early on, car headlights provided the only illumination. While other astronauts and families have been absent over the years, this year Roger Chaffee's wife, Martha, and her daughter, Sheryl, attended, along with Ed White's daughter Bonnie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the families' memorial,'' said Sonny Witt, the 45th Space Wing director of operations for Division 1 at Patrick Air Force Base, who helps provide the access. ''Not the Air Force and not <span class="companylink">NASA</span>. They are the ones that lost the husbands and brothers and fathers. Mistakes were made, and they paid the price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the three Apollo 1 astronauts were trapped in their burning capsule on Pad 34, a cry for help, believed to be from Mr. Chaffee, a rookie astronaut, came over the communications system: ''Hey, we're burning up.'' Mr. White tried opening the hatch, but caught within the highly combustible pure oxygen atmosphere, the crew suffocated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want any of this forgotten,'' Ms. Grissom said. ''Gus Grissom was a human being.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grissom, often seen as an underdog, was a favorite astronaut of many Americans. He infamously ''screwed the pooch'' -- as Tom Wolfe put it in ''The Right Stuff'' -- when the hatch blew on his Mercury capsule, causing it to sink it in the Atlantic upon splashdown. Mr. Grissom was initially blamed, and the sunken capsule cost the astronaut couple a visit to the Kennedy White House. In the end, he was cleared of responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Grissom, who lives in Houston by herself, and Mr. Grissom were high school sweethearts in Mitchell, Ind. Her life always revolved around him. She worked as a late-night telephone operator for Indiana Bell, putting her husband through college at Purdue, where he studied mechanical engineering on the G.I. Bill. He was selected as an astronaut after flying an F-86 Sabre on over a hundred combat missions in Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Death was always on the horizon for the wives. The program lost seven astronauts on the path to the moon, largely as a result of crashes of the T-38, the supersonic jet trainer airplanes the astronauts flew back and forth from where they lived in Houston and Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the news of the Apollo 1 accident came to her, delivered by a NASA doctor when she was at a friend's home for a weekly poker night, Ms. Grissom told her friend that she had ''already died 100,000 deaths'' living with her husband. Martha Chaffee, the youngest space widow, slept with the flag that hung over her husband's coffin at Arlington. Pat White killed herself years later, a weekend before she and some of the other wives had a reunion planned, her friends said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space widows felt rejected after their husbands died, while still living in the closely knit community of astronaut families in the ''space burbs'' by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Johnson Space Center) in Houston, nicknamed ''Togethersville'' because of its exclusivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late '60s, Ms. Grissom became a black sheep among the astronaut community. She was the first of the widows to sue <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s largest contractor, North American Rockwell, over the construction of the capsule, and she inspired Ms. Chaffee and Ms. White to do the same. Ms. Grissom eventually settled for $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, as Ms. Grissom was helped off the old launching pad, professional and amateur stargazers pointed out the International Space Station passing in the sky above, along with Venus and a shooting star. Back in the car and about to be driven to a celebratory dinner for friends and family at a hotel in nearby Cocoa Beach, she turned to her son and said, ''The stars are out tonight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, she spoke of how her husband's sacrifice helped pave the way for the missions to come like the Apollo 11 moonwalk her husband never got to see. Still, she said, ''I'm pretty sure he got to the moon before they did.'' She added: ''Of course he didn't make it, but in spirit I think he was already there.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes to about 9.5 x 10^41 kilograms -- that is, 95 followed by 40 zeros. The number, of course, is inexact, as obviously no direct measure of all the billions of stars and other objects in the Milky Way could be taken.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a paper to be published in The Astrophysical Journal, scientists used methods of measurement that involve complex mathematical and statistical techniques called hierarchical Bayesian analysis, as well as direct measurements of the velocity of globular clusters, the tightly packed spherical groups of 10,000 to 100,000 old stars that move through the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the mass of the sun can be calculated by measuring its gravitational pull on Earth, the mass of the Milky Way can be calculated by measuring its gravitational pull on the globular clusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimate includes everything within 125 kiloparsecs of the center of the galaxy -- that is, within 3.9 x 10^18 kilometers. And ''everything'' is not just stars: There are planets, moons, gases, dust and other objects, not to mention the immense amount of dark matter. It cannot be detected directly, but its mass can be inferred from its gravitational effect on other objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest thing is that we're including measurement uncertainties that are carried through the analysis,'' said the lead author, Gwendolyn M. Eadie, a doctoral candidate at <span class="companylink">McMaster University</span> in Hamilton, Ontario. ''So we have a good handle on the uncertainty in our mass estimate. The low end is 4.0 x 10^11 solar masses, and the high end is 5.8 x 10^11.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Eadie said that the findings were important from an astronomer's perspective. ''The methods we've developed could be important in other studies that do other kinds of research,'' she said. ''These methods have been used in other fields, but they're starting to become more useful in astronomy now that we have computers that can do these complex calculations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it mean for the rest of us? ''It just satisfies curiosity about the world we live in,'' she said.</p>

Dr. McEwen said that the image was taken while <span class="companylink">NASA</span> researchers were trying to calibrate the camera. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> knows precisely what color the moon's near side is, so when it wants to calibrate HiRise, it points it at the moon and takes some images. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> then analyzes the pictures and if the colors appear off it can correct the calibration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moon is boring. It doesn't change, it's relatively bland and it doesn't have all of these variations or changing clouds. It's a good calibration target,'' Dr. McEwen said. ''The Earth is a bad calibration target with all its variability like clouds and such, but it makes a pretty picture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth and the moon appear close in this image, but that is because the moon is actually just behind Earth. The researchers had to wait until the two celestial bodies were positioned like this because it provided them with the best view of the moon to perform their calibration, Dr. McEwen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make this picture, scientists combined two separate exposures taken on Nov. 20, 2016, which were processed differently. Dr. McEwen said that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> needed two exposures to make this image because a good image of the moon saturates Earth, and a good image of Earth makes the moon appear too dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vegetation appears red in this image, according to Dr. McEwen. The red spot in the middle of Earth is Australia, the one on the top left is Southeast Asia and Antarctica is the bright white blob in the bottom left.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk's long-range plans for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and his vision of sending people to Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, based in Hawthorne, Calif., has been set back since September, when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida, destroying the rocket and its payload, a $200 million Israeli satellite that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> had planned to lease to expand global internet services. The company's rockets had been grounded since then. An internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, which regulates commercial space launches, accepted <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s report on the explosion's causes on Jan. 6 and issued a launch license, clearing the way for Saturday's liftoff here, on the other side of the country. To prevent a recurrence, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday's countdown proceeded smoothly, with the liftoff occurring within a one-second window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current <span class="companylink">Iridium Communications</span> satellites. The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones, which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named ''Just Read the Instructions'' in the Pacific. Less than 90 minutes later, mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next 14 months, the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short-term, the successful launch helps put <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> back on track. The explosion and subsequent four-month grounding created a backlog of launches, including cargo missions for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to the International Space Station. September's explosion was <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s second failure in 15 months; a Falcon 9 rocket carrying <span class="companylink">NASA</span> cargo disintegrated in flight in June 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had lost $260 million in 2015 after the earlier accident, and revenue dropped 6 percent to $945 million. In earlier years, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> officials including Mr. Musk described the company as consistently profitable; that claim has been removed from <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company officials did not dispute the numbers reported in The Wall Street Journal article, but portrayed a rosy future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,'' Bret Johnsen, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief financial officer, said in a statement. ''Furthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hopes to launch its larger Falcon Heavy this spring. The Heavy, years behind schedule, would become the world's most powerful rocket since <span class="companylink">NASA</span> retired the Saturn 5 more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring. By reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on the schedule is an in-flight abort test of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Dragon 2 capsule, a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronauts to the space station next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By applying Silicon Valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business. That brought in many customers like Iridium, which is paying more than $450 million for the seven launches. The next-lowest bid from one of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s competitors was $1.2 billion, said Matthew J. Desch, Iridium's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s lower costs, Iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites, Mr. Desch said. ''The Falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lower costs make it difficult to see how <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Mr. Musk unveiled his vision for what he called the Interplanetary Transport System -- a gigantic rocket with 42 engines that could take 100 passengers to Mars as early as 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4,000 satellites. The forecasts described by The Wall Street Journal, which were produced in early 2016, show how much the company is depending on this new business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue, to $5 billion, in 2025. Satellite internet services, still in the early planning stages, were projected to bring in more than $30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than $20 billion in profit for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the September announcement, Mr. Musk spoke of ''a huge public-private partnership'' to get to Mars, but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw. The incoming Trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, although some of the president-elect's advisers, including Newt Gingrich, are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Republicans, however, have been strong defenders of the Space Launch System, the big, expensive rocket that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is developing for a Mars mission.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- When George Lucas spoke to Mayor Eric Garcetti about opening his Museum of Narrative Art here in Exposition Park, the filmmaker said he was captivated by the potential of being just steps away from a bevy of other museums. The California Science Center would be just next door, housing the Endeavor Space Shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lucas ''loved the idea of being able to see space travel imagined and space travel realized in the same park,'' Mr. Garcetti said in an interview Wednesday. And his decision to open the museum in Los Angeles instead of San Francisco offers a tremendous boon for the city, Mr. Garcetti said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Los Angeles is arguably the creative capital of the world,'' he said. ''This cements that and offers and offers a catalyst for the next generation of story tellers and story makers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lucas's decision on Tuesday ended a longcompetition between the two cities, which both vied to host the museum. The creator of ''Star Wars'' has spent years designing and redesigning a museum for his collection of fine and popular art, with each one tailored to a different site in different cities. He has pledged to finance the $1 billion project here, which is expected to bring thousands of construction and museum jobs to Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After previous plans to open in Chicago were canceled, Mr. Lucas and his architects revealed new renderings for both San Francisco and Los Angeles, causing months of speculation about which city was a better spot for the futuristic-looking museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will house his sprawling collection of some 10,000 paintings and book and magazine illustrations assembled over decades, including those by Norman Rockwell, R. Crumb, and N.C. Wyeth (whose artwork enriched ''Treasure Island''), as well as Hollywood memorabilia from Mr. Lucas's films and digital animation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lucas had previously proposed a Beaux-Arts style museum in San Francisco's Presidio park. In an interview in 2013 with The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>, Mr. Lucas said that the Presidio staff and board had stalled for four years on the project and snubbed his taste in architecture as an exercise in ''mimicking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then moved the evolving museum plan to the lakefront in downtown Chicago, but faced considerable opposition there and scrapped those plans before turning to the two California cities with new ones. The museum in Exposition Park will be surrounded by several other museums that already attract visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles location ''best positions the museum to have the greatest impact on the broader community, fulfilling our goal of inspiring, engaging and educating a broad and diverse visitorship,'' the board of directors wrote in the statement. The Exposition Park site is steps away from a Metro stop, and just across the street from the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span>, Mr. Lucas's alma mater.</p>

<span class="companylink">NASA</span> will be heading to a metal world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency announced on Wednesday that a spacecraft named Psyche would visit an asteroid named Psyche, one of two new missions it will be launching into the solar system in the 2020s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the purpose of simplicity, and out of our initial excitement, we just named our mission directly after what we're going to visit,'' said Lindy Elkins-Tanton, director of the Arizona State University school of earth and space exploration, who will serve as the mission's principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From radar observations, Psyche the asteroid appears ellipsoid in shape, about as wide as Massachusetts. It is also quite dense, with estimates of 200 to 450 pounds per cubic foot, which is much denser than most asteroids. (By comparison, the average density of Earth is 344 pounds per cubic foot.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psyche is also very bright, adding to suspicions that it is made of metal. ''Humankind has visited rocky worlds and icy worlds and worlds made of gas, but we have never seen a metal world,'' Dr. Elkins-Tanton said. ''It's the only roundish, fairly spherical metal body in our solar system. Not only is it unique, it's improbable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists like Dr. Elkins-Tanton think it is the nickel-iron core of a small planet that was bashed to pieces early in the history of the solar system. A trip to Psyche could reveal clues about what is at the center of Earth, something scientists will never be able to observe directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psyche, the spacecraft, is to launch in 2023 and arrive at Psyche, the asteroid, in 2030. The spacecraft is to orbit the asteroid for 20 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucy, the other mission <span class="companylink">NASA</span> selected on Wednesday, will also explore asteroids. Named after the fossil of a hominid ancestor of humans that lived more than three million years ago, Lucy is to launch in 2021 and then fly by six asteroids that are thought to be relics of the solar system, completing its mission in 2033. Its targets are the Trojans, asteroids that have been captured by Jupiter's gravity and now share the same orbit around the sun as Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The characteristics of Trojan asteroids vary widely, and planetary scientists think they formed in different parts of the solar system before being swept into Jupiter's orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that's telling something about how the solar system formed and evolved,'' said Harold F. Levison, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is the principal investigator of Lucy. ''The small bodies are really the fossils of planet formation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Psyche and Lucy are part of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Discovery program, a competition where scientists propose missions to the space agency to fit within a certain cost. The price tags for Psyche and Lucy are capped at $450 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> also announced that a third finalist, Neocam, a telescope to search for asteroids that could collide with Earth, would receive another year of funding to address issues that have been raised about that proposal.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as much as you might be hoping or dreading it to be true, this is probably not E.T.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chatterjee is the lead author of a paper published in Nature on Wednesday that details the search for the source of the radio waves known as ''fast radio bursts,'' intense pulses of radiation from the sky lasting only a few milliseconds. He also spoke at a news conference sponsored by the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span> in Grapevine, Tex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These have been disappointing times for those yearning for some alien direction from Out There. Last summer, Russian astronomers reported that they had recorded a promising-sounding signal from a star in the Hercules constellation, but they dismissed it when it became public as a freak bit of random radio noise, the astrophysical equivalent of a cosmic butt dial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, searches for radio signals from a set of stars with anomalous spectral features and another star known as Tabby's Star that has shown suspicious variations in its light seem to have come up empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So at least for now, the skies appear to be bereft of intelligence. But the new results from the fast radio burster, known as 121102 -- after Nov. 2, 2012, the date it was first observed -- need not discourage any aficionados of cosmic mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most likely, Dr. Chatterjee said in a telephone interview, the bursts could be caused by weird reactions between a neutron star -- the dense spinning magnet left behind by a supernova explosion -- and the debris from that explosion. Or perhaps from some unexpected quirk of a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy, a dwarf assemblage of stars some three billion light-years away in the constellation Auriga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are problems with both explanations, however, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast radio bursts have led astronomers on a merry chase ever since they were discovered in 2007 in data recorded earlier by the Parkes radio telescope in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they are so short and until recently have never been seen to repeat, these phantoms have been hard for astronomers to study. Usually, astronomers notice them after the fact. Moreover, radio telescopes have poor angular resolution, making it impossible to determine exactly what star or distant galaxy they came from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radio emissions themselves, Dr. Chatterjee said, resemble the blasts from pulsars -- the spinning neutron stars that emit clocklike pulses of radiation and whose discovery in 1968 did indeed elicit speculation about little green men. But the radio waves arrive on Earth dispersed or spread out in time by wavelength, which implies that they have traveled from far outside our galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That great distance also implies that they are enormously more powerful than pulsars in our galaxy, adding to the mystery of what they are and raising the question of why they are not seen within our own galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, 18 of the fast bursters have been spotted since they were first recognized in 2007 -- a small number. If extrapolated to the whole sky, that means 5,000 to 10,000 of these flashes should happen every day. Where are they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lacking much evidence to the contrary, astronomers theorized that the bursts resulted from apocalyptic events like collisions of neutron stars. At one point, Dr. Chatterjee said, there were more theoretical models of the bursts than observed bursts. ''Many things go bang,'' he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big break came in 2012 when the burst known as 121102 repeated itself. Subsequent observing campaigns with the Very Large Array of telescopes in New Mexico and the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico recorded a total of nine bursts over 83 hours of observing time and a terabyte of data during a six-month period in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That meant that whatever was causing 121102, at least, was not destroying it. ''We definitely know, for this one case anyway, the radio burst is not cataclysmic,'' Dr. Chatterjee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, papers also have been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters by two other groups led by Shriharsh Tendulkar of <span class="companylink">McGill University</span> and by Benito Marcote of the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe, in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following up on the Very Large Array observations, Dr. Marcote's team on the European VLBI network was able to pinpoint the location of the burst to a faint dwarf galaxy in the Auriga constellation. Dr. Tendulkar and his colleagues then used the eight-meter Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii to observe the galaxy and measure its distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That distance, three billion light-years, confirmed the original supposition that the fast bursts come from far, far away. ''The host galaxy is puny,'' Dr. Tendulkar said during the news conference in Grapevine. That dwarf galaxy is only a hundredth of the mass of the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this burster, 121102, is indeed typical of the bunch, the astronomers said, this might be a clue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such galaxies are typically home to some of the most violent events in the universe, Dr. Chatterjee said, things that go seriously boom in the night like certain kinds of gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernova explosions that result in extremely magnetic pulsars known as magnetars. These are the signatures of massive stars, of the deaths of massive stars, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this only raises more questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only one that repeats is from three billion light-years,'' Dr. Chatterjee mused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Where are all the nearby ones?'' he asked, noting that they should be even brighter, saturating our radio receivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very curious,'' he said.</p>

Over the next four years, Pan-Starrs, short for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, photographed the entire sky, as seen from Hawaii, 12 times in five colors of visible and infrared light.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the astronomers who operate Pan-Starrs released the first results from their survey. Their big data universe lists the positions, colors and brightness of three billion stars, galaxies and other objects. It amounts to two petabytes of data, roughly equivalent to a billion selfies, according to a statement from the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy. All this information, the universe in a box, now resides in the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (named for Barbara A. Mikulski, the retiring Maryland senator and space champion) at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore where any astronomer can get access to it. In 2017, the Pan-Starrs team plans to produce a new catalog of how these things are moving and changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was an exercise in more than just curiosity. A big goal of the project, run by an international consortium led by the <span class="companylink">University of Hawaii</span>, is to discover moving objects like asteroids so that we can visit them and perhaps steer them away before they visit us, as well as discover supernovas and other rare violent events while they are still exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pan-Starrs is the biggest digital mapping effort yet done, but it is not the last. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope now being built in Chile by the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span> will eventually supersede it, surveying 37 billion galaxies and stars and producing 15 terabytes of data every night for 10 years once it is completed in 2022.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe 1947 crash of a mysterious aircraft near Roswell, N.M., that fueled half a century's worth of U.F.O. theories occurred near a ranch where Mitchell, then 16, lived. There is a photograph of the astronaut Edgar Mitchell emerging from the Apollo 14 capsule, a ragged cone of scorched metal and shredded foil bobbing in the South Pacific 880 miles off the coast of American Samoa. A wetsuit-clad Navy swimmer is helping him out of the access hatch and into an inflatable raft. Mitchell, dressed in an olive-drab flight suit and a biological mask, steadies himself with his left hand on the door frame. He is 40, with the receding hairline and blandly gentle affect of a family dentist. It is Feb. 9, 1971, and he has just had an epiphany.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened on the flight back from the moon, where Mitchell and his colleague Alan Shepard had traversed the Fra Mauro region and trekked to the Cone Crater to gather geological samples that, it was hoped, might reveal something of the moon's inner structure. As the Kitty Hawk command module hurtled homeward, Mitchell watched the earth, moon and sun passing by the window of the rotating capsule in two-minute intervals. Looking out into space, Mitchell later recalled, ''I realized that the molecules of my body and the molecules of the spacecraft had been manufactured in an ancient generation of stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell was a naval aviator whose doctoral dissertation, from M.I.T., was on guidance systems in low-thrust interplanetary vehicles. Nothing in his training had equipped him for a sudden discovery of the oneness of all things. ''It was a subjective visceral experience accompanied by ecstasy,'' he would later tell a yoga magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Apollo years, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> sent military test pilots into space, not poets or preachers; they came back in possession of extraordinary knowledge that, by dint of personality or professional inclination, they seemed helpless to communicate. As the Gemini and Apollo astronaut Michael Collins once put it, ''It was not within our ken to share emotions or to utter extraneous information.'' Asked what it was like to go to the moon, Apollo 12's Pete Conrad replied: ''Super! Really enjoyed it!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then there was Mitchell. After returning to Earth, he left <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, grew a beard and divorced his wife. He founded the <span class="companylink">Institute of Noetic Sciences</span>, which advocated exploring the universe by means of inquiry that lay outside of science and religion. He sought out South American shamans and Haitian Vodou priests, promoted the benefits of Tibetan Buddhist lucid dreaming, visited the homes of people who claimed their children could bend spoons with their minds. He went on Jack Paar's talk show with the self-proclaimed psychic Uri Geller. Two more marriages, one of them to a former Playboy playmate, came and went. He got deep, very deep, into theories about extraterrestrials. He had a posthumous cameo in the cache of John Podesta's hacked emails that <span class="companylink">WikiLeaks</span> published this year, which included messages Mitchell sent to Podesta (a U.F.O. buff) asking him to discuss the possibility of disclosing the federal government's records of alien contact. He signed the emails ''6th man to walk on the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he got weird sometimes -- O.K., a lot of times -- could you really blame him? Few people had a closer view than Mitchell of the staggering velocity of the 20th century. He spent his early years on a West Texas farm with horse-drawn plows, watched a mushroom cloud bloom over a Marshall Islands atoll as a young Navy pilot and temporarily escaped his home planet before his 41st birthday. ''I have wondered if we are prepared for our own survival,'' he wrote late in life. The only way for humans to gain some control of the species' mad trajectory, he believed, was ''by questioning many fundamental assumptions underlying civilization.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell was the last surviving member of his mission. The seven living Apollo astronauts who stood on the lunar surface are all in their 80s now; within a decade, probably, the experience of walking on the moon will be as alien to the living as the experience of fighting in the Peloponnesian War. The American flags Mitchell and the others planted there are most likely faded to white now, after years of unimpeded solar radiation, gnomic banners of no particular nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans, and especially American politicians, tend to consider this an indictment of the national character, the final departure from the moon in 1972 the beginning of a slow retreat from destiny. But Mitchell believed his odyssey was beyond ''the capricious political whim of a technological civilization.'' When he first stepped onto the moon, ''that pristine bone-white world,'' he was overcome with a sensation of belonging. ''The stillness,'' he wrote, ''seemed to convey that the landscape itself had been patiently awaiting our arrival for millions of years.''//</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a blazing light at the center of the interplanetary romance ''Passengers,'' and its name is Jennifer Lawrence. In a love story whose attempt to be an interstellar ''Titanic'' eventually falls flat, Ms. Lawrence's character, Aurora, is an ambitious journalist aboard the Avalon, a commercial spacecraft making a historic 120-year voyage. Its destination is Homestead II, a pioneer colony of an overcrowded Earth. The spunky, whip-smart Aurora, who bought a round-trip ticket, hopes to write the first book about Homestead II upon her return to New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Aurora is prematurely roused from a state of suspended animation, her hopes are dashed. Her awakener, Jim (Chris Pratt), is a hunky mechanical engineer who is jolted back to consciousness when an asteroid hits the Avalon and is aghast to find himself alone. Realizing that he faces 90 years of solitude on the spacecraft, can't return to his hibernation pod and will never live to reach his destination, he begins to fall apart.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spotting the recumbent Aurora, radiant in her pod, he savors her beauty, admires her thumbnail biography and falls in love. Against his better moral judgment, he revives her. Once outside her pod, Aurora is devastated to learn that she, like Jim, will almost certainly die en route to Homestead II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon Jim and Aurora embark on a romantic courtship and quickly fall in love. Given their beauty, that may not sound bad until you consider their future in joint isolation with nothing to do but eat, drink, make love and play shadow games with holograms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its most gripping, ''Passengers,'' directed by Morten Tyldum (''The Imitation Game'') from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts (a collaborator on the scripts for ''The Darkest Hour,'' ''Prometheus'' and ''Doctor Strange''), conveys the panic and despair of finding yourself trapped in a luxurious corporate prison in the middle of nowhere. Solitary confinement, even amid opulence, is solitary torture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after ''Passengers'' ends, this creepy premise haunts your imagination. And the contrast between the chilly impersonality of the Avalon and the anguish of its human cargo lends the first half of the movie a desperate poignancy. Were I in Jim's shoes, I would also drown my sorrows nightly the way he does at the well-stocked bar tended by a friendly android, Arthur (an amusing Michael Sheen).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their idyll abruptly ends when Arthur spills the beans to Aurora about Jim's role in her awakening, and she explodes in a stunning fit of fury that is the movie's dramatic high point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its more relaxed first half, ''Passengers'' allows room for needling satire of the airline industry. Depending on the ticket price, the 5,000 passengers can expect different levels of service once they're revived in the journey's final four months. As a ''gold star'' passenger, Aurora is entitled to a sumptuous breakfast, while Jim has to settle for cold cereal. We also learn that the corporation behind this space travel is a very successful operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before its midpoint, the film begins its retreat from the moral questions raised by Jim's selfishly dragging Aurora into his personal hell. He may be handsome and charming and mechanically adept, but he's rather dull and inarticulate with no defined personality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aurora and Jim are the latest embodiments of Hollywood's ever-evolving ideal of young lovers. Both are white and beautiful, with the likable Mr. Pratt suggesting a new-and-improved perfect specimen of a familiar jock type. It is Ms. Lawrence's feisty wonder woman who warms the movie with her sizzling volatility and intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''Passengers'' increasingly succumbs to timidity and begins shrinking into a bland science-fiction adventure whose feats of daring and skill feel stale and secondhand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things briefly improve when another accidentally reawakened passenger, Gus (Laurence Fishburne), appears, and helps the couple figure out what's wrong with the ship. But because his character is dying, his appearance amounts to little more than an extended cameo. It seems the asteroid strike set off the Avalon's slow breakdown, and it is up to Jim, with Aurora's help, to set things right, save them, and in the process redeem himself in her eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its haste to tie up loose ends as efficiently as possible, ''Passengers'' becomes a banal, formulaic pastiche of dozens of other like-minded space operas in which the human drama gives way to technological awe. And Ms. Lawrence's light softens to a 40-watt glow. Except for one special effect, its action scenes are anything but awesome. None are more disappointing than the couple's perfunctory, suspense-free spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one exception is a scene in which the gravity aboard the ship suddenly fails. Aurora is swimming when the water in the pool suddenly rises and she risks drowning inside an aquatic plume. Such delicious moments of movie magic are in painfully short supply.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 23, 2016, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Take a Number article on Tuesday about <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System misstated one aspect of the system. It will only receive GPS signals; it will not also reflect them. In addition, the article referred imprecisely to the number of GPS satellites the Cygnss mission will work with. While each of the eight satellites will talk to four GPS satellites at any given time, there are 30 GPS satellites to choose from -- not just four.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> announced that it would open an official account at Giphy, a GIF database and social media platform, bringing the space agency up to speed with the way young people communicate in the internet age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, kind of. The agency announced its new account (and one on <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>) in somewhat bureaucratic, defiantly non-millennial terms.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> engages and inspires the public by sharing unique content through social media,'' it said in a news release. ''Don't forget to check out <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s accounts regularly, as there are more Pins and GIFs to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Animated GIFs -- or graphics interchange format -- are short, looped video clips often shared around the internet. You may not know the term, but you've seen them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s official mission is to educate the public, and the agency has been using new media to accomplish that task for more than half a century, even as the cutting edge has shifted from the TV screen to the computer screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 20, 1969, an estimated 600 million people watched live as the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first humans to walk on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 1980s, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> specialists communicated with interested members of the public on Usenet, a digital forerunner of modern web forums -- like an early version of Reddit's A.M.A.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had a site on Gopher, an early system for sharing information over the internet, which featured downloadable image links and technical papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyler Menzel, Giphy's editorial director, said that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had approached them about the partnership. The agency's decades of ''mind blowing footage of planets, space travel and astronauts flipping around in zero gravity'' made it an ideal partner, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What more would you want from a partner?'' he asked. ''Someone comes to you and is like, 'We've got this. What do we do with it now?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site's editorial team helped <span class="companylink">NASA</span> translate its videos into the more than 462 short clips now featured on its giphy page, no charge, it said. They include footage of engineers celebrating in a mission control room, astronauts experimenting aboard a spacecraft and a rover that seems to wave from the surface of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in new media, said communicating with the public has become more complicated for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> as the internet has grown more commercial since those early days of Usenet forum chats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think they've done a good job within the constraints that they have to operate,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a government agency, they can't play favorites with corporate entities,'' he added. ''And they can reach millions of people easily; I think they have to be careful about how they do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Pyle, a graphic artist who has worked with <span class="companylink">NASA</span> for over a decade, said that he created his first GIF for the agency about a year and a half ago. It was an artistic imagination of Kepler-452b, an exoplanet that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> described as Earth's ''bigger, older cousin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love what an animated GIF like this gives you,'' Mr. Pyle said. ''There's no real beginning or end to it, which I think creates a very 'you are there' vibe. You can imagine sitting in your spaceship parked next to this thing, just watching it spinning on its axis forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GIFs have become a ubiquitous feature of digital communication. If emojis can be seen as the virtual equivalent of body language, as some linguists have argued, then GIFs could be seen as representing particularly outsized gestures, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loren Grush, who reports on space for The Verge, described GIFs as essential to online expression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As someone who writes about space and who communicates primarily with moving images that last just a few seconds in length, a NASA Giphy account is basically an entire dictionary for me,'' she wrote. (Ms. Grush is the daughter of two former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> engineers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Eppink, a curator of digital media at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens who recently put together an exhibit on reaction GIFs, explained the operative feature of GIFs. He said that GIFs were one of the few mediums people were content to watch over and over again, as the duration of each loop is so short, often only a few seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was a particularly good fit for the medium, both because space ''captures the imagination'' as the best GIFs do, and because celestial bodies tend to do the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything that's been around for billions of years is probably doing something repeatable,'' he said. ''The motion of the stars, planets and moons, all orbiting other bodies: There's a sort of cosmic symmetry there that intuitively seems to make sense for GIFs.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks after a presidential election that could have vaulted him to the head of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, John Grunsfeld reached across his peanut curry at a small restaurant on the Far West Side of Manhattan, grabbed my notebook and sketched out a plan for a trip to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld, astronomer, astronaut, and former associate administrator of NASA, was in town to promote a National Geographic TV series about Martian exploration. On his shirt was a picture of a space shuttle and the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've been having a kind of Mars moment lately. Audiences filled theaters last year to watch Matt Damon as ''The Martian.'' Personalities as diverse as President Obama and Elon Musk have declared the Red Planet the next great destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days leading up the election, Dr. Grunsfeld said, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was thinking about a Mars mission to get ready for the transition. He himself was rumored to be on the short list to run the space agency should Hillary Clinton have won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> has never had a scientist as administrator; you and I would have had fun,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, nobody knows where <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s rockets are going on their biblical smoke pillars. Donald J. Trump's one mention of the space program during his campaign was to tell a kid that potholes on Earth need fixing first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he also campaigned on the promise to ''make America great again,'' and hardly anything in recent history says that more clearly than the Apollo moon landings. That has some space buffs hoping that a Trump administration will put its weight behind another grand adventure in space, most likely a return for good to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, there is no evidence that Congress would give <span class="companylink">NASA</span> any more money than it is already getting to carry out these adventures. Mr. Trump's potholes, a military buildup and tax cuts beckon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in December, the first member of Mr. Trump's transition ''landing team,'' Christopher Shank, policy director for the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and a former member of <span class="companylink">NASA</span> arrived at its headquarters to begin taking stock of the agency. He did not respond to an email request for an interview and none of the other members of the team, which now numbers seven, have commented publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">NASA</span> insiders are reduced to reading tea leaves and possible smoke signals, clues scattered by Mr. Trump and Republican space and science insiders during the last year. In a recent speech in Washington, Bob Walker, a former congressman who advised the Trump campaign on space, reiterated his desire for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to concentrate on basic science and exploration and farm out climate research, which he has referred to as ''politicized science,'' to other agencies like <span class="companylink">NOAA</span>. That's a notion that alarmed climate scientists regard as either naïve or cynical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walker also said that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would be presiding over a reinstated National Space Council, last used during George W. Bush's administration, to oversee and coordinate civilian and military space efforts. One of its jobs would be to decide how much <span class="companylink">NASA</span> should depend on commercial space entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk and Jeff Bezos to shoulder the rocket load.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer many of these insiders, including Michael Griffin, a former NASA former administrator, gathered around a television at Mr. Shank's house to cheer on Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, as she spoke at the Republican National Convention. Denouncing what she saw as a lack of American leadership, at least as far as human spaceflight was concerned, she noted that it had been five years since an American was launched into space from American soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are a nation of explorers,'' she declared. ''Nations that lead on the frontier lead in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since John Glenn orbited Earth in 1962, the United States space program has limped through a series of auspicious starts and stops. Americans landed on the moon in 1969 and abandoned it in 1972. We built the space shuttle and then retired it; we embarked on the Constellation program to return to the moon, then canceled it in favor of eventually going to Mars. The International Space Station was supposed to get us ready for deep space travel, but we haven't gone anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glenn died last week, at age 95. Reflecting on the long arc of his life and the space program, Dr. Grunsfeld asked, ''What do we have to show for it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are we in for another outer space pivot back to the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the many Trump advisers is Newt Gingrich, who promised a lunar colony by 2020 when he was running for president four years ago, quipping that it could apply for statehood someday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time eyes rolled, but times have changed. Recently Jeb Bush declared it a ''cool'' idea. Europe, China and Russia are all reportedly eager to establish a base on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Bridenstine, an Oklahoma congressman rumored to be in the hunt for NASA administrator, said in a recent speech: ''This is our Sputnik moment. America must forever be the pre-eminent spacefaring nation, and the moon is our path to being so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the attractions of a lunar base, its adherents say, would be the ability to mine ice at the moon's poles to produce rocket fuel. According to recent studies, refueling at the moon, or nearby, would be the cheapest way to go to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be the mother of all infrastructure projects, perhaps a notion attractive to Mr. Trump's developer instincts, in effect paving a highway to Mars and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would also take a lot of money, time and political capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moon's a nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we can go to Mars without breaking <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s budget, Dr. Grunsfeld said, reaching for my notebook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First he drew a line of rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget the giant heavy-lift super booster rocket. Assemble a Mars spacecraft in orbit using the kinds of rockets like Atlas or Delta we already have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose it takes 10 launches to get all the pieces up there, he said. At $350 million a launch, that adds up to $3.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding in another $500 million to launch the crew brings the total to $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the spaceship segments themselves cost $1 billion apiece, the whole Mars ship is $14 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make two, just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For $4 billion a year for seven years you get a Martian spaceship including a full spare,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does the money come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, this is the amount of money <span class="companylink">NASA</span> now spends on the space station every year, money that will be available one day to go someplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could only go around Mars, without landing . But it would still be an epochal voyage, the interplanetary version of Apollo 8's Christmas voyage around the moon in 1968, setting the stage for what is to come if people are ever going to live off-planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone should do it. All that money would be spent here -- on things we say we care about, like science, technological development and education, things that stimulate the economy and inspire generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Going to Mars would make <span class="companylink">NASA</span> great again,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked him how long it would all take. Seven to 10 years, he texted me later. ''Whenever someone decides to start.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rochester -- On April 1, 1960, the newly established <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> heaved a 270-pound box of electronics into Earth orbit. In those days, getting anything into space was a major achievement. But the real significance of that early satellite, Tiros-1, was not its survival, but its mission: Its sensors were not pointed outward toward deep space, but downward, at the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiros-1 was the first world's first weather satellite. After its launch, Americans would never again be caught without warning as storms approached.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This small piece of history says a lot about the call by Bob Walker, an adviser to President-elect Donald J. Trump who worked with his campaign on space policy, to defund <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s earth science efforts, moving those functions to other agencies and letting it focus on deep-space research. ''Earth-centric science is better placed at other agencies where it is their prime mission,'' he told The Guardian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> critics have long wanted to shut the agency out of research related to climate change. The problem is, not only is earth science a long-running part of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s ''prime mission,'' but it is uniquely positioned to do it. Without <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, climate research worldwide would be hobbled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s role in earth science began at its inception: The Space Act of 1958, which created <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, made the study of our atmosphere one of its top priorities. During the Reagan years, Congress amended the act to make Earth the first of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s nine fundamental missions. Right now there are at least 15 earth-science satellites that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> helped build, launch and operate; they monitor everything from global rainfall to soil moisture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These spacecraft foster billions of dollars of economic activity and affect millions of lives. Soil moisture measurements, for example, make their way back to farmers planning their crops. Ice-pattern measurements find their way to the shipping industry for navigation. Space-based measurements of environmental conditions make it to medical workers predicting the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these missions were explicitly designed to study climate change. They were planned to study the Earth, which naturally includes the climate. But the data from these missions tell us that Earth's climate is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or Grace, mission. It was designed to study Earth's gravity field, meaning the planet's distribution of mass. Grace could ''see'' changes in ocean currents, precipitation runoff on land and changes in groundwater storage. Grace showed us the spreading of drought conditions as water tables dropped. In this way the Grace data speak directly to a fundamental mistake of the agency's critics. Climate change is not the direction of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s earth-science enterprise; it's a conclusion of that effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheer scale of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s 60-year mission to study Earth is why conclusions about climate change caused by human activity are so firmly established. And it's that scale that makes proposals to move <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s earth-science program somewhere else a recipe for taxpayer waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics make it seem like the program's $2 billion budget goes to a handful of climate-crazed computer modelers, and that moving earth science from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> would just be an exercise in pushing desks around. But that money covers a lot: It goes to thousands of technicians building satellites for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and its contractors. It goes to people at Cape Canaveral who launch satellites atop of 100-foot pillars of high explosives. It goes to engineers operating those satellites as they wheel some 300 miles overhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s storied success comes in part through its economies of scale. Engineers building instruments for a Mars mission will bring their expertise to developing sensors for an earth-science satellite. Thus the kind of experience <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has built isn't fungible. Just as it would be folly to ask the Army to build and operate submarines, asking someone else to do <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s job would be an invitation to organizational chaos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agencies like the <span class="companylink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span> and the <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span> also represent monumental accomplishments of American science. But neither has the reach or experience to take on what America asks of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>. <span class="companylink">NOAA</span>, an agency of the Department of Commerce, has a budget of just $6 billion, a fraction of which is spent on earth science. Asking it to absorb part or all of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s earth science effort would be like watching a snake try to swallow an elephant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proposals to get <span class="companylink">NASA</span> ''back to'' some other kind of science not only ring false but their wasteful price tag would also fly in the face of fiscal conservative values. And worse, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s climate critics miss an essential point in their effort to politicize the science. The planet is changing, and that change will pose challenges and opportunities. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> brings the capacity to know something about what tomorrow will bring. We would be foolish to mess with that kind of competence.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Iridium Communications</span>, which provides communications services through a constellation of more than 60 satellites, announced Thursday that it was aiming to launch the first batch of its next-generation satellites on a <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> Falcon 9 rocket on Dec. 16.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch hinges on approval by the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, which is reviewing <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s investigation of the Sept. 1 launchpad explosion. A Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Fla., caught fire and exploded during fueling before a test firing of its engines. The explosion destroyed a $200 million Israeli satellite that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> had planned to use to expand internet services in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Matthew J. Desch, chief executive of Iridium, said his company had taken part in the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> investigation, adding that he had read a preliminary explanation for the accident. ''I wouldn't approve our satellites to be launched if I wasn't confident,'' Mr. Desch said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking forward to return to flight with the first Iridium NEXT launch,'' Gwynne Shotwell, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement, referring to Iridium's satellite constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.A.A. said that the investigation was still underway and that it had not yet approved the launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> officials did not provide any new technical details of what went wrong in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview on CNBC in November, Elon Musk, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s chief executive, said the company had identified the cause. Liquid oxygen flowing into a second-stage tank had frozen solid, setting off a catastrophic sequence of events, he said. In that same interview, Mr. Musk said he hoped to resume flights in mid-December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explosion damaged <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 Iridium satellites will instead lift off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the site of a second <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launchpad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iridium provides communication services including satellite telephones through its network of satellites circling the Earth at an altitude of 485 miles. The original satellites launched two decades ago at a cost of $5 billion, but Iridium flopped, declaring bankruptcy in 1999. The company finally found its financial footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixty-five of the original satellites are still in orbit, and Iridium is planning to replace all of them in the next year and a half, with seven Falcon 9 launches carrying 70 satellites, each roughly the size of a Mini Cooper. The new satellites are bigger and more powerful, able to send data at faster rates. Iridium is also planning new services like the tracking of planes and ships in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will know where every airplane is, second by second,'' Mr. Desch said. That could prevent another disaster like the disappearance of <span class="companylink">Malaysia Airlines</span> Flight 370, which vanished in March 2014. More important, Mr. Desch said, that kind of real-time global information would allow the assignment of more efficient flight paths for airliners while still making sure they stay safely apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For launches from Florida, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. It is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span>, the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span>, reported that a Soyuz rocket carrying the Progress 65 cargo ship successfully lifted off from Kazakhstan. The first six minutes and 22 seconds of the flight proceeded normally. But shortly after the upper stage separated from the core booster, flight telemetry stopped, leaving ground controllers confused about what had happened.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span> later confirmed that the Progress 65 and its cargo had been destroyed, with the failure occurring about 120 miles over Tuva, a Russian republic in southern Siberia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six astronauts at the space station -- three Russian, two American and one French -- are safe and have adequate supplies, <span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span> and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo included 1,400 pounds of propellant, 112 pounds of oxygen, 925 pounds of water, and 2,750 pounds of spare parts, supplies and scientific experiment hardware. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> said the Progress was not carrying any supplies crucial for the United States side of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Japanese cargo ship is scheduled to launch and head to the space station on Dec. 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space station managers will have to do some juggling of plans and adjust coming cargo flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the fourth loss of a spacecraft carrying cargo to the space station in the past 25 months. In October 2014, an Antares rocket built by <span class="companylink">Orbital ATK</span> exploded six seconds after it lifted off in Virginia. Six months later, a Russian Progress cargo ship spun out of control. Then, a Falcon 9 rocket built by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> disintegrated during flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before that, the space station program had experienced the loss of only one cargo ship -- another Progress, in August 2011 -- in nearly 16 years. This fall, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called for accelerated construction at a new launch site to replace the current Cosmodrome, which Russia leases from Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financially ailing Russian space program will temporarily reduce the number of crew members to two from three at the space station next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the flow of supplies to the space station appeared to be getting back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Antares rocket with different engines successfully reached the space station in October. Several Progress ships successfully ferried cargo to the space station before Thursday's failure. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 also resumed flights but then was grounded again after one of the Falcon 9 rockets exploded on the launchpad during fueling for an engine test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is now aiming to resume the launching of commercial satellites this month, and its next cargo flight is planned for January 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials now seem prescient in asking <span class="companylink">Orbital ATK</span> to launch its next cargo mission with an Atlas 5 rocket, built by <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, rather than an Antares rocket. Although the redesigned Antares worked well, the Atlas 5 has a long, successful track record and it can lift a heavier payload, allowing <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to pack in more supplies. That mission is to take off in the spring.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDC. Megan Urry is a former president of the American Astronomical Society and the first woman to head the physics department at <span class="companylink">Yale University</span>. Recently inducted to the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span>, she has published pioneering studies on the role of black holes in the formation of galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20 years ago, Dr. Urry helped organize 200 scientists who issued the Baltimore Charter for Women in Astronomy, which declared that ''women should not have to be clones of male astronomers in order to participate in mainstream astronomical research.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, she announced that scientists with a record of sexual harassment would no longer be welcome at the astronomical society's meetings. We spoke at her New Haven, Conn., office. A condensed and edited version of the conversation follows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why was the meeting ban necessary?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We had a situation where we had young female astronomers reporting conference experiences that were very different from those of their male counterparts. The men came and used the event to network. The women came and sometimes found themselves worried about people propositioning them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wanted to make clear what our values are. I said straight out, ''Look, our meetings are not 'The Dating Game.' This is a professional environment. Act professionally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was there much sexual harassment at astronomy conferences?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably no more than at other corners of academe. It's a problem all over. I suspect we're hearing more about astronomy because our young people are complaining more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen, two years ago, there was a survey published about scientific disciplines where people do field work. A high level of harassment was reported. For the men, the approaches came mainly from peers. The women reported being hit on by their superiors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's extremely troubling because in academia your career is in the hands of your adviser. If he's approaching you for sex, you're in trouble. There's generally no path forward in academe for the woman who has a powerful antagonist angry at her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's your own story? Did you always want to be an astronomer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. In high school, I was the girl who was good at everything -- English, history, math, science. For a while, I thought I might like to become the first woman president. A female chemistry teacher counseled me to think about a scientific career. She said I thought like a scientist because I was always comparing things to one another. I think it was my father, a science professor at Tufts, who suggested astrophysics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those days, the 1970s, I thought I'd be able to do anything with my life. I chose physics because it was clean and elegant. I didn't go through that thing that often happens to teenage girls where they fall off of the cliff of self-confidence and get discouraged about science. The discouraging things happened later on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In graduate school and later, when I was a postdoc at M.I.T. Before then, there was a lot of discrimination around me, but I had rationalizations. If I didn't see other females in advanced classes, I thought, ''Maybe no other woman wants to do this.'' I now think my attitude was laughable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I got to M.I.T., in 1984, there were very few women full professors, maybe two. I was the only female postdoc at the Center for Space Research. It was there that I first started examining the environment I had chosen. I could see that there were plenty of young women starting out in STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] fields, though the higher one went, the fewer the women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was the atmosphere at M.I.T. discouraging to your own ambitions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guy who hired me was wonderful, but there were very few women. I remember a male assistant professor once telling me I'd have an easy time obtaining employment once I finished, because affirmative action ''gave women a big advantage over more qualified men.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1990, when I got my first faculty position, I saw more sexism. This was at the Space Telescope Science Institute, on the <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins</span> campus. At the time, around 15 percent of the Ph.D.s in astronomy went to women. Yet, there were only three other woman among 52 faculty members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When women applied for jobs, the guys would come hear their talks. Then, they'd go, ''Well, I don't know how much of that was hers.'' And then some guy gave a talk that was vague and undocumented, and they'd go, ''Let's try to hire him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why remain at such a workplace?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-body problem. My husband worked near Baltimore, and I wanted to be where he was. And the work itself was exciting. We did the science for the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wasn't paid equally. How do I know? At a certain point, I received something called an ''equity raise,'' which signaled my pay was at the bottom of my cohort. Just about all the other women got similar equity raises. We were, as a group, at the bottom of the heap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I struggled between intellectual self-confidence and constant put-downs. Once, when I requested a raise because I'd been offered tenure and a 30 percent increase at another institution, I was turned down with ''maybe you're not as smart as you think you are.'' I cried for hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another time, I applied for a job I was qualified for. A male administrator sneered, ''You know what makes a leader? Someone others will follow -- you're not that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was so beaten down I didn't even argue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People say this is the best time in history to be doing astronomy. Is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absolutely. The big news is in my own area -- black holes, the center of galaxies. Last year, LIGO [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory] detected gravitational waves from a pair of merging black holes in a galaxy probably a billion light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waves were, of course, interesting by themselves. What fascinated me was that the merged black holes were roughly 30 times the mass of our sun. They were, at once, too small and too big for a black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's much smaller than the supermassive black holes we've seen in the centers of galaxies, and much bigger than the black holes that come from exploding stars. It could be something entirely new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to LIGO, we've learned that the masses of the two black holes appear to have merged. The two are measured at about 30 solar masses, which is different, smaller, from what we usually see. There's some thought that they may be remnants from the first generation of stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past 15 years, I've been discovering where and when black holes grew. My tools have been ground and space telescopes such as Keck and Hubble. We've learned a lot from them. The LIGO discovery suggests a new way to study the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will we not need those space-based satellites anymore?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, the Chandra X-ray telescope and the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope have taught us the most about black holes. It appears that every black hole emits X-rays. The newest space telescopes spot them instantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The James Webb Space Telescope, which is slated to be launched in 2018, is utterly amazing. It's much bigger than Hubble, and it will enable us to see some of the first galaxies ever.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- Sitting in a drab industrial neighborhood surrounded by warehouses and factories, Astroscale's Tokyo office seems appropriately located for a company seeking to enter the waste management business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only inside do visitors see signs that its founder, Mitsunobu Okada, aspires to be more than an ordinary garbageman. Schoolroom pictures of the planets decorate the door to the meeting room. Satellite mock-ups occupy a corner. Mr. Okada greets guests in a dark blue T-shirt emblazoned with his company's slogan: Space Sweepers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Okada is an entrepreneur with a vision of creating the first trash collection company dedicated to cleaning up some of humanity's hardest-to-reach rubbish: the spent rocket stages, inert satellites and other debris that have been collecting above Earth since Sputnik ushered in the space age. He launched Astroscale three years ago in the belief that national space agencies were dragging their feet in facing the problem, which could be tackled more quickly by a small private company motivated by profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's face it, waste management isn't sexy enough for a space agency to convince taxpayers to allocate money,'' said Mr. Okada, 43, who put Astroscale's headquarters in start-up-friendly Singapore but is building its spacecraft in his native Japan, where he found more engineers. ''My breakthrough is figuring out how to make this into a business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last half-century, low Earth orbit has become so littered with debris that space agencies and scientists warn of the increasing danger of collisions for satellites and manned spacecraft. The <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> now keeps track of about 23,000 pieces of space junk that are big enough -- about four inches or larger -- to be detected from the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say there could be tens of millions of smaller particles, such as bolts or chunks of frozen engine coolant, that cannot be discerned from Earth. Even the tiniest pieces move through orbit at speeds fast enough to turn them into potentially deadly projectiles. In 1983, the space shuttle Challenger returned to Earth with a pea-size pit in its windshield from a paint-chip strike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And plans are being made to make low orbit even busier, and more essential for communications on Earth. Companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and OneWeb are aiming to create vast new networks of hundreds or even thousands of satellites to provide global internet connectivity and cellphone coverage. The growth of traffic increases the risk of collisions that could disrupt communications, as in 2009 when a dormant Russian military satellite slammed into a private American communications satellite, causing brief disruptions for satellite-phone users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, each strike like that creates a cloud of shrapnel, potentially setting off a chain reaction of collisions that could render low orbit unusable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we don't start removing these things, the debris environment will become unstable,'' said William Ailor, a fellow at the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research and development center in California. ''We will continue to have a growing debris population that could affect the ability to operate satellites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Mr. Okada, a former government official and internet entrepreneur, who said a midlife crisis four years ago prompted him to return to his childhood passion of space. As a teenager in 1988, he flew to Alabama to join the United States Space Camp at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, and later chose to attend business school at <span class="companylink">Purdue University</span>, the alma mater of his hero, Neil Armstrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, Mr. Okada realized that he could use his experience in the start-up world -- he had founded a software company in 2009 -- to get a jump on other space debris projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The projects all smelled like government, not crisp or quick,'' he said of conferences he attended to learn about other efforts. ''I came from the start-up world where we think in days or weeks, not years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has created a two-step plan for making money from debris removal. First, Astroscale plans to launch a 50-pound satellite called IDEA OSG 1 next year aboard a Russian rocket. The craft will carry panels that can measure the number of strikes from debris of even less than a millimeter. Astroscale will use this data to compile the first detailed maps of debris density at various altitudes and locations, which can then be sold to satellite operators and space agencies, Mr. Okada said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to get revenue at an early stage, even before doing actual debris removal, to prove that we are commercial, as a business,'' said Mr. Okada, who added that he had already raised $43 million from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more ambitious step will come in 2018, when Mr. Okada says Astroscale will launch a craft called the ELSA 1. Larger than its predecessor, the ELSA 1 will be loaded with sensors and maneuvering thrusters that will allow it to track and intercept a piece of debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company settled on a lightweight and simple approach to grabbing space debris: glue. Astroscale has worked with a Japanese chemical company to create an adhesive that would cover a flat surface about the size of a dinner plate on the ELSA 1. The craft would bump into a piece of space junk, which would stick to the craft and be dragged out of orbit. Both the ELSA 1 and the debris would burn up on re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of deorbiting space junk is not novel. As the debris problem has grown in urgency in recent years, space agencies and companies have released dozens of concepts for cleaning up low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force has proposed a ''laser broom'' that would use ground-based lasers to vaporize a spot on an object's surface, creating a puff that would act like an engine to push it down toward the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other proposals call for using robotic arms, nets, tethers and even harpoons to spear debris. The challenge, experts say, is to build an unmanned spacecraft that can be used to track, approach and grab a dark object tumbling through space at 17,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Imagine trying to grab a spinning skater on an ice rink,'' said Raymond J. Sedwick, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland, ''except, instead of a person, it's an S.U.V. And instead of you being there in person, you're remotely flying a drone, the lighting is bad, you have limited sensory data, there is no obvious place to grab onto, and you might be operating under a time delay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That said, we need to do something'' about space debris, Dr. Sedwick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if a technology works, such efforts face another hurdle: the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Okada said the key to bringing down a price tag of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars is to reduce the weight. He said that the Elsa 1's adhesive would weigh just a few ounces, far less than, say, a 100-pound robotic arm, and that his company's engineers had found ways to bring the spacecraft's weight down to 200 pounds, making it much lighter than other proposed craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the U.S., aerospace engineers are more interested in working on missions to Mars, not waste management,'' Mr. Okada said. ''Japan doesn't have so many interesting space missions, so engineers were excited by my idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that Astroscale would start by contracting with companies that will operate big satellite networks to remove their own malfunctioning satellites. He said that if a company has a thousand satellites, several are bound to fail. Astroscale will remove these, allowing the company to fill the gap in its network by replacing the failed unit with a functioning satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our first targets won't be random debris, but our clients' own satellites,'' he said. ''We can build up to removing debris as we perfect our technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said this approach would also get around a hurdle in international law to the removal of space debris -- the required permission of the owner. Under a 1967 treaty, man-made objects in space belong to the countries that launched them, and cannot be touched without approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Okada said finding ways around these various barriers was more than a business proposition; it would also be the fulfillment of a childhood dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see a business opportunity in solving a problem that nobody knows how to solve,'' Mr. Okada said. ''But my enthusiasm is because I am going back to my teenage passion: space.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using radar soundings from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, scientists probed what lies in Utopia Planitia, a 2,000-mile-wide basin within an ancient impact crater.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the region looked intriguing because of polygonal cracking and scalloped depressions in the landscape. In places on Earth like the Canadian Arctic, patterns like these arise from ice beneath the surface. The ground cracks as ice underneath expands and contracts with the changing temperatures; the scallops, as if carved by an ice cream scoop, are places where the surface sinks as the ice melts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd say, 'It looks like there's ground ice there,''' Cassie Stuurman, a graduate student at the <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>, said about Utopia Planitia. ''What we haven't known is how much is there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An older <span class="companylink">NASA</span> orbiter, Mars Odyssey, found the region dry, but its instruments could only investigate about a yard beneath the surface. Ground-penetrating radar on Reconnaissance could peer much deeper into the ground, collecting data as the orbiter made more than 600 passes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stuurman, the lead author of an article in the journal Geophysical Research Letters that described the findings, said the radar reflections revealed that the ice sheet, ranging in thickness from 260 to 560 feet, covered an area larger than New Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ice is fairly pure -- at least 50 percent frozen water -- with dirt, rocks and porous empty spaces mixed in, researchers believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's kind of what I'm imagining,'' Ms. Stuurman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water ice is plentiful at the Martian poles, but Utopia Planitia might be a more attractive landing site for future astronauts, because it is in the more temperate mid-northern latitudes. Water ice cannot persist on this part of the Martian surface. The solid ice would transform to water vapor and float away. But hidden by a layer of soil, the ice remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to providing something to drink, water could be split into oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stuurman said the vast deposit of ice suggests that it accumulated as snowfall during one of the planet's ice ages and was later buried. She said there were no signs that this snow ever melted into a lake.</p>

For 12 years Cassini has been buzzing about Saturn, its rings and its moons. As a result we know that there are methane lakes on Titan and jets of water shooting from Enceladus, and the rings themselves have warps, ripples, hills twists and braids.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">313 pp. Crown Archetype, $28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes before his first spaceflight, Massimino had an epiphany: This was really stupid. He hated heights and roller coasters, so why had he strapped himself into a space shuttle, the most dangerous ride imaginable? If something malfunctioned now, ''all those years of training were completely pointless,'' he realized. ''There are emergency placards and safety signs all over the interior of the shuttle. .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. That stuff is there to give you something to read before you die.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Spaceman'' isn't a typical astronaut memoir. Massimino confesses to feeling scared and inadequate sometimes, and rarely flatters himself. Some astronauts look fighter-pilot cool; he looks like ''a guy who'd be working at a deli in Brooklyn, handing out cold cuts.'' In an engineering course in college, he once scored 11 percent on a midterm. He also failed his Ph.D. oral exam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What kept Massimino going was an unrivaled ability to shrug off humiliation. ''Everyone from the NASA administrator to our janitorial support .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. had confidence in me,'' he writes about one low moment. ''I needed to have the same confidence in myself.'' However hokey, these pep talks worked: He eventually became a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> ''Jedi,'' a member of the ace spacewalking crew that repaired the billion-dollar Hubble Space Telescope in orbit. (Of course, being Massimino, he almost broke it later.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Massimino was right to feel a premonition of death on his first launch. His mission actually got swapped in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s shuttle lineup with Mission 107 -- the Columbia flight that disintegrated over Texas in 2003. That should have been him up there, and in a poignant scene he describes being flooded with memories as he wandered the wreckage. Yet he supports continued human spaceflight, dismissing the argument that unmanned probes can make progress more quickly. If nothing else, he says, we need humans up there to inspire us. During astronaut training, Massimino was merely adequate at most tasks, never the best. But after returning to Earth, he began lecturing on his experiences, and he decided, ''Maybe I could be one of the best at telling the story of space.'' If ''Spaceman'' is any indication, he might well be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SPACE TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mark Thompson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">257 pp. Pegasus, $27.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts typically spend weeks at most in space and reach altitudes of just a few hundred miles. In ''A Space Traveler's Guide to the Solar System,'' Thompson, an astronomer, takes readers on a grander journey -- a hypothetical 50-year, multibillion-mile rocket tour of every planetoid and moon between the sun and Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like any good guidebook, this one highlights some overlooked gems in our neck of the cosmos. Mercury rotates so slowly that the sun often appears to stop in the sky and reverse course. The weather on Uranus might include ''diamond rain'' that collects in a ''diamond ocean.'' Even overrated sites will still wow you. Mars's Olympus Mons -- the ''tallest volcano in the solar system,'' a mountain the size of Arizona -- is actually too big to appreciate with the naked eye. It slopes upward so gradually that it curves beyond the horizon, and you can't see the summit from the base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thompson also includes several nice asides about the biology and psychology of long-term spaceflight, including aspects of sex in zero gravity. We might titter over details like the proposed 2Suit, which would prevent couples in the million-mile-high club from floating apart. But we do need to research coitus in outer space if we hope to colonize distant planets someday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially at the beginning, ''A Space Traveler's Guide to the Solar System'' sometimes gets mired in details. You can't fault Thompson's enthusiasm for propulsion systems and axes of rotation -- he loves geeking out -- but these passages lack immediacy. Still, once we're off and sailing, he steers readers on a heavenly course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE 37TH PARALLEL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Secret Truth Behind America's UFO Highway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Ben Mezrich</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">260 pp. Atria, $26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The 37th Parallel'' is part conspiracy thriller and part character sketch -- but it doesn't quite deliver on either. Mezrich details the exploits of Chuck Zukowski, a microchip engineer in Colorado who scours the West for evidence that aliens have invaded. He's especially obsessed with animal mutilations -- creepy incidents in which cows and horses have their eyes, tongues and internal organs sliced out. Why aliens would travel a trillion miles to butcher some poor cows isn't clear, but Zukowski turns his life upside down to establish a connection, tracking down animal autopsies and becoming a volunteer sheriff to get access to incident reports. He eventually stops working full time, forcing his wife to take two jobs. Even then, he blows their savings on night-vision goggles and a freezer to store horse remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book falls flat as a conspiracy thriller because its revelations are so pathetic. Zukowski cherry-picks some reports and decides that most animal mutilations fall along a ''paranormal highway'' centered on the 37th parallel. Inconveniently, the alien epicenter of Roswell, N.M., lies 275 miles south of the mark, but the Pentagon and Area 51 are pretty close, as was the earthquake that rumbled Washington, D.C., in 2011. Again, it's not clear why cow-mutilating aliens would trigger earthquakes, but that doesn't dampen Zukowski's enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the character study, Mezrich provides some vivid scenes to get inside the mind of a convinced alien hunter -- the paranoia, the convoluted reasoning, the slide down ''that slope from hobby to passion to obsession.'' But this doesn't build to much, since Zukowski never meaningfully changes; he merely grows more and more convinced. Nor does his relationship with his wife develop. I kept reading in part to see whether she'd finally file for divorce, but time and again she forgives him. However admirable, this makes for frustrating reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incredibly, Zukowski considers himself a skeptic, a dispassionate sifter of facts. ''There's more physical evidence that U.F.O.s exist than there's physical evidence that Jesus Christ existed,'' he says. It's a good line, but the chasm between real evidence and cow-mutilating aliens can be measured only in light-years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the petals of a 20-foot sunflower seeking the light, the 18 hexagonal mirrors that make up the heart of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s James Webb Space Telescope were faced toward a glassed-in balcony overlooking a cavernous clean room at the <span class="companylink">Goddard Space Flight Center</span> here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the room, reporters and a gaggle of space agency officials, including the ebullient administrator Charles Bolden, were getting their pictures taken in front of the giant mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after 20 years with a budget of $8.7 billion, the Webb telescope is on track and on budget to be launched in October 2018 and sent a million miles from Earth, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope, named after NASA Administrator James Webb, who led the space agency in the 1960s, is the long-awaited successor of the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven times larger than the Hubble in light-gathering ability, the Webb was designed to see farther out in space and deeper into the past of the universe. It may solve mysteries about how and when the first stars and galaxies emerged some 13 billion years ago in the smoky aftermath of the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipped with the sort of infrared goggles that give troops and police officers night vision, the Webb would peer into the dust clouds and gas storms of the Milky Way in which stars and planets are presently being birthed. It would be able to study planets around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s dream since 1996 when the idea for the telescope was conceived with a projected price tag then of $500 million But as recently as six years ago, the James Webb Space Telescope was, in the words of Nature magazine, ''the telescope that ate astronomy,'' mismanaged, over budget and behind schedule so that it had crushed everything else out of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s science budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A House subcommittee once voted to cancel it. Instead, the program was rebooted with a strict spending cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientific capabilities of the telescope emerged unscathed from that period, astronomers on the project say. The major change, said Jonathan P. Gardner, the deputy senior project scientist, was to simplify the testing of the telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the pain was dealt to other <span class="companylink">NASA</span> projects like a proposed space telescope to study dark energy, which the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> had hoped to put on a fast track to be launched this decade. It's now delayed until 2025 or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, the Webb telescope was a technologically ambitious project, requiring 10 new technologies to make it work. Bill Ochs, a veteran Goddard engineer who became project manager in 2010 during what he calls the ''replan,'' said the key to its success so far, was having enough money in the budget to provide a cushion for nasty surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telescope smiling up at us like a giant Tiffany shaving mirror is 6.5 meters in diameter, or just over 21 feet, compared with 2.4 meters for the Hubble. The aim is to explore a realm of cosmic history about 150 million to one billion years after time began -- known as the reionization epoch, when bright and violent new stars and the searing radiation from quasars were burning away a gloomy fog of hydrogen gas that prevailed at the end of the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, astronomers don't know how the spectacle that greets our eyes every night when the sun goes down or the lights go out wrenched itself into luminous existence. They theorize that an initial generation of stars made purely of hydrogen and helium -- the elements created during the Big Bang -- burned ferociously and exploded apocalyptically, jump-starting the seeding of the cosmos with progressively more diverse materials. But nobody has ever seen any so-called Population 3 stars, as those first stars are known. They don't exist in the modern universe. Astronomers have to hunt them in the dim past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ambition requires the Webb to be tuned to a different kind of light than our eyes or the Hubble can see. Because the expansion of the cosmos is rushing those earliest stars and galaxies away from us so fast, their light is ''red-shifted'' to longer wavelengths the way the siren from an ambulance shifts to a lower register as it passes by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So blue light from an infant galaxy bursting with bright spanking new stars way back then has been stretched to invisible infrared wavelengths, or heat radiation, by the time it reaches us 13 billion years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the Webb telescope will produce cosmic postcards in colors no eye has ever seen. It also turns out that infrared emanations are the best way to study exoplanets, the worlds beyond our own solar system that have been discovered in the thousands since the Webb telescope was first conceived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to see those infrared colors, however, the telescope has to be very cold -- less than 45 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero -- so that its own heat does not swamp the heat from outer space. Once in space, the telescope will unfold a giant umbrella the size of a tennis court to keep the sun off it. The telescope, marooned in permanent shade a million miles beyond the moon, will experience an infinite cold soak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sunshield consists of five thin, kite-shaped layers of a material called Kapton. Way too big to fit into a rocket, the shield, as well as the telescope mirror, will have be launched folded up. It will then be unfolded in space in a series of some 180 maneuvers that look in computer animations like a cross between a parachute opening and a swimming pool cover going into place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least that is the $8 billion plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers have done it on the ground, and it worked. The same people who refolded the shield after each test will fold it again, in a process Mr. Ochs compares to packing up your parachute before a jump. The test will come in space, where no one will be able to help if things go wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That whole process will amount to what Mr. Ochs called ''six months of high anxiety.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the most part, it all has to work,'' Mr. Ochs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time <span class="companylink">NASA</span> did something this big astronomically, in 1990, things didn't quite work. Once in orbit, the Hubble couldn't be focused; it had a misshapen mirror that had never been properly tested. Astronauts eventually fitted it with corrective lenses, and it went on to become the crown jewel of astronomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making sure that doesn't happen this time is the agenda for the next two years. ''Our telescope is finished,'' John C. Mather, the senior project scientist, said. ''Now we are about to prove it works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming weeks, the mirror and the box of scientific instruments on its back will be put on a rig and shaken to simulate the vibrations of a launch, and then sealed in an acoustic chamber and bombarded with the noise of a launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the parts survive unscathed, the telescope assembly will be shipped to a giant vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. There it will be chilled to the deep-space temperatures at which it will have to work, and engineers will actually focus the telescope, twiddling the controls for seven actuators on each of the 18 mirror segments. No Hubble surprises here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the telescope will go to Los Angeles to be mounted on its gigantic sunshield. That whole contraption, now too big for even the giant C-5A military transport plane, will travel by ship through the Panama Canal to French Guiana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket supplied by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> as part of Europe's contribution to the observatory, and go into orbit around the sun at a point called L2 about a million miles from Earth. Canada, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s other partner, supplied some of the instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then come the six months of anxiety. Sometime in the spring of 2019, if all goes well, the telescope will record its first real image -- of what, the assembled astronomers were not ready to guess. In a bonus undreamed of when the Webb telescope was first conceived, it looks as if the Hubble will still be going strong when the Webb is launched. They will share the sky and the potential for joint observing projects. A million miles apart, they can view objects in the solar system from different angles, providing a kind of stereoscopic perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the expected baby galaxies and the exoplanets, there are, as astronomers like to remind us, always new surprises (like colliding black holes when the LIGO observatory was turned on last year) when humanity devises a new way to look at the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what the telescope's greatest discovery would be, Dr. Mather said, ''If I knew, I would tell you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor would the project members talk about contingency plans to rescue the telescope if anything goes wrong a million miles from Earth. There are no plans to fix it or bring it back. They know how to attach a probe or robot to the telescope, Dr. Mather said, but ''we are planning to not need it, thank you.''</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention galactic space, at least as it's represented at the Children's Museum of the Arts. This downtown institution, dedicated to helping young visitors experience artwork as well as create it, has devoted its latest exhibition to interstellar travel. The show, ''Mission to Space,'' displays pieces by contemporary artists, including David Bowie. He appears as the alien Ziggy Stardust in 1972 photographs by Masayoshi Sukita and as both the hapless astronaut Major Tom and his Ground Control handler in the earliest incarnation of the 1969 music video ''Space Oddity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He used to bring his daughter, Lexi, to the museum when it was on Lafayette Street,'' Barbara Hunt McLanahan, the museum's executive director, said, referring to its original SoHo location. (Lexi, more formally known as Alexandria Zahra Jones, is now 16.) ''It looks homemade, as if kids could have made it,'' Ms. McLanahan said of the video, noting that it is not the official version. ''I like that this is here as a tribute to Bowie, with very homespun special effects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other pieces are just as fanciful, like E. V. Day's ''Bridal Supernova,'' which uses fishing tackle and hardware to transform a Barbie doll wedding dress into an exploding star. Nina Katchadourian's photographs seem to show real space rocks, but their title, ''Popcorn Asteroids,'' gives them away: They're enlarged images of popped kernels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other photographic subjects couldn't be more genuine. Andrew Zuckerman contributed not only his portraits of objects used in space travel and his prints derived from previously undeveloped film from Apollo missions, but also his space memorabilia: a Russian astronaut's glove and a mock-up of a lunar rake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some artists have added playful twists to the idea of space exploration. Tom Sachs made his own astronaut's glove, and Penelope Umbrico called up <span class="companylink">Google</span> Moon images on her computer, then shot them with her iPhone. Paintings capture the adventure, too, like Thomas Broadbent's eerily floating ''Spaceman,'' and Michael Kagan's ''Rattle Them Bones,'' an exuberant, wildly colorful shuttle liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard not to get your imagination fired up by space,'' Ms. McLanahan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum gives visitors additional ways to fire theirs, with related art projects and ''Crazy Space,'' a play installation in its tube-shaped bridge area. Here, they can look out on stars and friendly extraterrestrials and push a small comet around a model galaxy. At the end is a bench for listening to numbers that always rock: a taped countdown to liftoff.</p>

And their amber glass ashtrays overflowed with cigarette butts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, that atmospheric clutter has largely been removed. ''Right now the room looks pretty sterile,'' said Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, historian for the Johnson Space Center, which contains the Apollo control room, now a national historic landmark.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall Space Center Houston, a nonprofit that organizes public tours of the Apollo operations center, has set out to raise $3 million to help restore the center's late-1960s appearance. In the next few months, staff members will begin bringing back historically accurate details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Binders, maps, pencil sharpeners, logbooks, flags and plastic foam coffee cups will be placed on consoles and desks. The original configurations of keyboards, monitors and TV sets will be recreated, and buttons and lights will be activated to evoke a sense of missions in progress. Rows of cameras will be reinstalled on the ceilings. Period clothing and hats will be hung from coat racks. (Some of the low-tech equipment will most likely puzzle children unfamiliar with the workings of rotary phones, reel-to-reel tapes and pneumatic tubes that delivered data printouts.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want it to look like the flight controllers have just walked away from their consoles for a bit,'' said Sandra J. Tetley, a historic preservation officer at the Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historians have interviewed former mission workers, who remember squinting at consoles through the haze of cigarette and cigar smoke. Headsets blared multiple audio channels at the same time, and the cacophony echoed in the workers' ears even after they went home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the intensity of their Apollo workdays, Ms. Tetley said, ''They get very emotional when they start talking about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that the center's employees are still reaching out to former space mission workers and their descendants in hopes of documenting their recollections. They are also seeking photos and other souvenirs that will yield insights into the control room's original appearance and workings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum</span> in Washington is also restoring equipment used on Apollo missions. Galleries for the material, with items like spacesuits and even a toothbrush and a container of shark repellent (for those ocean splashdowns), will be redone in the next few years. Among the recent acquisitions going on display will be a camera that was mounted on the lunar module of Apollo 11 during the 1969 landing that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. Two years ago, Mr. Armstrong's widow, Carol, found the camera at the couple's home, forgotten in a bag in a closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan Needell, curator of the museum's space history division, said there are also plans to exhibit the mangled remains of an Apollo 11 engine, which were rediscovered a few years ago during underwater expeditions off the Florida coast. (Other chunks of Apollo engines that turned up during the dives have been sent to the Museum of Flight in Seattle.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The photographer Roland Miller has published images of ruined and preserved Apollo launch and operations sites and artifacts in a recent book, ''Abandoned in Place: Preserving America's Space History.'' Among the relatively well-maintained facilities is Launch Complex 34 at Cape Canaveral in Florida, where three astronauts died in a fire during a test aboard their spacecraft in 1967. But on buildings and their remnants elsewhere, paint is peeling, vines are choking walkways and owls have nested in the crannies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that he took home a few souvenir bolts and fiberglass fragments from structures being demolished. While visiting dozens of sites and reflecting on the space program's achievements and tragedies, he said, ''There were times when it was a very overpowering feeling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Nov. 11, Heritage Auctions in Dallas offered a few hundred objects related to Apollo missions. Equipment and supplies included foodstuffs (which sold for $4,000), a film fragment that was part of a roll of photos taken by Mr. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin while on the moon ($550), a heat shield plug ($5,500) and an aluminum tool ($37,500) with a lens and brush that were used to clean and analyze moon rocks. Flags and silver medallions that astronauts carried on the flights each took in $1,500 to $37,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale's contingent of paperwork that was consulted during flights, either onboard spacecraft or at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> offices, included an engineers' logbook recording the demands of ''working all weekends'' ($4,500), a plan book for lunar surface operations ($6,875) and a launch checklist ($42,500). Cue cards and lunar surface maps brought a few thousand dollars each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autographed photos in the sale (which sold for up to $2,750 each) showed Houston staff members during Apollo flights, smoking cigars, wearing headsets and surrounded by coffee cups, snacks and stacks of binders. They were also photographed waving American flags after missions went well.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if scientists discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a 330-foot asteroid hitting the Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simulation projected a worst-case blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, the movie ''Armageddon'' dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: ''The United States government just asked us to save the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, ''but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,'' Mr. Chodas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif., comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy's National Laboratories, the Air Force and the <span class="companylink">California Governor's Office of Emergency Services</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid'' years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could take up to two years to build such a ''kinetic impactor'' spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a ''deflection mission,'' was necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered, was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the ''100x Declaration,'' which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100,000 per year in the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,'' Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group's website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest space-related explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a medium-size hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the <span class="companylink">British Broadcasting Corporation</span> reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more Chelyabinsk-size space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement debunking the idea, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth ''without incident -- just as <span class="companylink">NASA</span> said they would.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing is everything, and ''Mars,'' a six-episode experiment in hybridization that begins Monday on the National Geographic Channel, feels as if it is landing at a particularly inopportune moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series, from Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, is half-fiction, half-documentary, mixing real-life interviews about the possibility of going to Mars with a fictional story set in 2033 about the first people to land there. It is hoping to rekindle the spirit of President John F. Kennedy's call to go to the moon. But that would require an aspirational resolve that looks outward with hope and confidence. The series has its premiere at a moment when, in the United States at least, the presidential election has left many looking inward with snarls full of uncertainty.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mars'' has conceptual problems in any case, though the attempt is interesting. The fictional half isn't particularly sophisticated as space odysseys go. A crew of six is arriving at Mars as it opens, and there's trouble during the landing that leaves the commander (Ben Cotton) injured and the ship a long way from its intended touchdown spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're conditioned to expect impressive special effects in a space story, but don't look for many here. In the first two episodes, at least, the crew spends a lot of time either staring with alarm at video screens or marching across the barren Martian landscape. Some effort is made to give the crew members back stories, though in the early going it's focused mostly on the commander (whom we see as a child in flashbacks) and the mission pilot, whose twin sister is part of the team monitoring the flight back on Earth. (The singer and composer JiHae plays both roles.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the series gets sometimes intriguing, sometimes awkward, is in the shifts to documentary mode. The idea is to have present-day Mars enthusiasts explain the challenges scientists are grappling with as they contemplate a mission to Mars even as we're seeing the fictional crew of 2033 encounter those challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trip to Mars is a long trip, seven months,'' says Norm Knight, a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> official. ''And we have to understand: What does it mean for an astronaut to be in orbit for that amount of time?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strain on astronauts' bodies; the harshness of the Martian environment; the technical problems of building a landing base robotically, so there's a habitat for the first humans -- those and more are among the issues discussed, and these segments are illuminating. Less welcome are the ones that sound like promotional videos for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> or for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the space transport and exploration company founded by Elon Musk, who is a frequent presence here. At least these portions don't gloss over things; we see the failures of the agency and the company along with their successes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole enterprise is short on sophistication, as if it's aimed at high school students with an interest in science. Nothing wrong with that, of course, since that's the age group that would have to become interested enough to carry an actual Mars mission forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all of this seems a decidedly remote possibility at the moment, with many of us Earthlings preoccupied with more immediate, less lofty matters. It's easy to see how the hopes for this series might have progressed: ''The Martian,'' the acclaimed 2015 film, piqued interest, then last month President Obama reiterated the goal of reaching the Red Planet, and now ''Mars'' could get the buzz into high gear, right? Probably not. There's too much buzz about too many earthbound topics at the moment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it's true that on Sunday and Monday nights the moon will be at its closest to Earth in nearly 70 years. But to the casual observer, it probably won't look much different from a regular full moon. Yet headlines heralding the event as some sort of don't-miss spectacle are everywhere.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supermoon isn't unique in being sensationalized. Several times every year some sort of catchy-named lunar activity grabs attention, whether warranted or not. That's how we've ended up with must-see events like the blood moon, the black moon, the blue moon, the strawberry moon and the harvest moon, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some of these names have historical and cultural origins, many are rooted in folklore and are often overhyped. Below you'll find an explanation of the science and origins behind some of these events that will let you decide whether they are worth late nights or early mornings of moongazing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you do want to watch the supermoon, the exact time that the moon will be closest will be Monday around 6:22 a.m. Eastern time, but it may shine brighter when the sky is darkest on Sunday and Monday nights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supermoon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The supermoon is a made-up term,'' said James Lattis, an astronomer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ''It's not an astronomical term, there's no technical definition of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supermoon was actually coined by an astrologer in the 1970s, not by a scientist. The term has come to loosely mean a full moon that is at perigee, or when the moon is at its closest position to Earth along its orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, this definition can vary, which means supermoons can occur multiple times a year, or about once every 14 months, depending on the definition you use. The next so-called supermoon will be on Dec. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supermoon on Sunday and Monday nights is supposed to be special because it is the closest the full moon will be to Earth since 1948. That means it will be the biggest and brightest full moon in about 68 years. Compared to an average full moon, this supermoon will be approximately 7 percent larger and 15 percent brighter. But most people won't be able to tell the difference between it and a regular moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no fireworks show, no blinking sign that says, 'Hey, this is the supermoon!' '' said Noah Petro, a deputy project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the supermoon really shines when it is compared with the full moon at apogee, or its farthest position from Earth. If you place images of the two side by side, you can see the difference more easily, Dr. Petro said. The supemoon is 14 times larger than the apogee full moon and 30 percent brighter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, the moon is about 238,900 miles away from Earth. But Sunday and Monday's supermoon will be approximately 221,524 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers measure the distance of the moon from Earth by shooting lasers to the surface of the moon, which then bounce off mirrors called retroreflectors, which were left behind by the Apollo missions and two Soviet landers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though most people will not notice anything special about this supermoon, Dr. Petro said it will still be a good excuse to start gazing at the night sky more regularly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blood Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon moves completely behind Earth's shadow. Recently, this event has given rise to the sinisterly named blood moon, because the moon becomes a dark reddish-brown as it's consumed by Earth's shadow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A term like that has a number of problems,'' Dr. Lattis said. ''In the case of a total lunar eclipse, they aren't always red. The term blood moon not only suggests, it exaggerates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lattis also said that the reddish color of the moon during a total lunar eclipse did not have anything to do with the moon itself. Instead, it get's its red appearance because of the way the Earth's atmosphere scatters light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than make a fuss about its sanguine color, people should admire the total lunar eclipse. Early astronomers like Aristotle used it to figure out that Earth was round by observing the shape of the shadow that the planet casts on the moon. You can expect the next total lunar eclipse in July 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've all heard the saying ''once in a blue moon,'' but what does that really mean? And how often do they occur?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two definitions that float around for the elusive blue moon. One refers to the second full moon in a calendar month. Full moons typically occur once every 29.5 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other definition, which is older, says that a blue moon is the third full moon in a season that had four full moons. Typically, a three-month season has three full moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So to answer the question, blue moons occur about once every two and a half to three years -- most recently on May 21, 2016. But depending on the definition you use, they could occur more frequently. The next one will be on Jan. 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And no, they are not blue in color.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ominously named twin to the blue moon, a black moon is in some ways the opposite of its brother. It's the name given to the second new moon in a month. New moons are the first phases of the moon, during which time they are not visible. So they appear black against the night sky, but not any darker than any other new moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other definition is that a black moon is the third new moon in a season of four new moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar to blue moons, these typically occur about every two and a half to three years -- most recently on Oct. 31, 2016, which made for the spooky-sounding Halloween black moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strawberry Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every month's full moon has a unique name if you look at The Old Farmer's Almanac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It bestows names like full wolf moon, full worm moon, full flower moon, full buck moon, full sturgeon moon and full beaver moon. Folklore has it that those names came from Algonquin Indian tribes and their terms for the full moon during different times of the year. But that might be debated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one knows whether someone made those up in the '30s or if they go back to real Indian use because there aren't real records prior to that,'' said Gordon Johnston, an Osiris-Rex program executive at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> who studies moon names as a hobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's moon is known as the full strawberry moon or the full rose moon. The idea behind the names is that they have to do with the season when the Algonquin collected strawberries. Rose moon might have been named by Europeans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the moon is tinged red, but that occurs in the summer because the moon appears lower on the horizon. The most recent strawberry moon happened on June 20 and coincided with the summer solstice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvest Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The harvest moon, unlike some of the other moons, has an astronomical meaning. It is the closest full moon to the autumnal equinox. Folklore says that farmers would use the light of the harvest moon to collect their crops in the fall. The harvest moon appears in September and shines brightly for a few nights in a row. Following the harvest moon is the hunter's moon, which is thought to have provided people with extra moonlight to seek out food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both names are relics of a more agrarian era. Now, they provide us with an opportunity to reflect on the moon's importance to people of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of these names of the moons are due to the fact that the moon for centuries has captivated humans,'' Dr. Petro said. ''I wish nowadays we'd do the Super Bowl moon or modernize these names for our culture so people pay attention to the moon.''</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the simulations also show how the dynamics of the moon and Earth slowed down and straightened up over the next four billion years of the solar system, leaving them where they are today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the first time, this paper has a model that says we can start in one place and explain all of that without invoking any other follow-on event,'' said Sarah T. Stewart, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Davis. ''And that's new, and that's exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Where did the moon come from?'' has been a persistent question over the eons. Among the rocky planets of the inner solar system, Earth is an anomaly. Mercury and Venus have no moons at all, and Mars has only a couple of potato-shape tiny moons (both less than 15 miles across) that may be captured asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth's moon, by comparison, is a giant, more than 2,000 miles in diameter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the preferred explanation for the origin of the moon has been ''the big whack'': very soon after the formation of Earth and the rest of the solar system, the Mars-size interloper that astronomers have named Theia bumped into Earth. The resulting slosh of debris coalesced into a slightly larger Earth and the moon in orbit around Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hypothesis explains a lot, in particular how to create a big moon. (Others have suggested that the moon formed elsewhere and was then captured by Earth's gravity or that the two formed at the same time, in orbit around each other, but no one could calculate how these could plausibly occur.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there remained nagging discrepancies between the moon as it exists and the predictions of the big whack model. For one, the composition of the moon is very similar to that of Earth. Planetary scientists would have thought the moon would more closely resemble Theia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, Dr. Stewart and Matija Cuk, then a postdoctoral researcher, proposed a variation, that Theia slammed into Earth at high speed, scrambling up the materials of the two bodies. The resulting Earth would also have been spinning fast, and they explained how the gravitational interactions with the sun would have then slowed everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We changed the impactor,'' Dr. Stewart said. ''We changed the energy. We're changing momentum. We're changing the way the moon forms. We're now changing the whole dynamical sequence. Everything is different except the words, 'giant impact.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stewart and Dr. Cuk said the revised calculations explained most everything about the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was still a nagging discrepancy -- a five-degree tilt of the moon's orbit compared with the orbits of the planets and most everything else in the solar system. It's what astronomers call the plane of the ecliptic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The motion of moons and planets follow an orderly set of rules, Dr. Stewart said. ''It makes very clean predictions, and when something goes against the orderly set of rules, it requires something special happening,'' she said. ''The clean prediction is the moon is in the ecliptic. Period. That's where it should be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its birth, the moon was quite close to Earth, probably within 20,000 miles. Because of the tidal pulls between Earth and moon, the moon's orbit has been spiraling outward ever since, and as it does, Earth's pull diminishes and the pull of the sun becomes more dominant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, with the moon a quarter of a million miles from Earth, the sun's gravity should have tipped the moon's orbit to lie in the same plane as the ecliptic. Last year, two astronomers proposed that planetesimals perhaps as big as the moon itself buzzing through the inner solar system tipped the moon's orbit through repeated close passes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Cuk, now a scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., came up with an alternate idea: Maybe the moon's orbit is still tilted, because the Earth started off very tilted. The flexing of the Earth and the moon by the gravitational tidal forces dissipates energy, causing the moon to spiral outward. The dynamics can become complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lunar spin axis does interesting things,'' said Dr. Cuk, the lead author of the new Nature paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, tidal locking -- where one side of the moon always faces Earth -- is lost for a while before locking in again. It is possible that the far side of the moon was originally the near side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stewart said some of the transitions in orbits could have heated up the interior of the moon, and signs of that melting might be observable in rocks on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alessandro Morbidelli, one of the astronomers who proposed the planetesimals hypothesis, said nothing was proved yet, and both models relied on assumptions. ''Certainly it is an interesting model and it will trigger a lot of future work,'' he said of the new paper. ''I think that our model cannot be ruled out.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we've gotten to the bottom of the problem,'' Mr. Musk said during an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box program. ''Really surprising problem that's never been encountered before in the history of rocketry.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk described it as the toughest puzzle solved that the company has ever had to solve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed the Falcon 9 rocket as well as a $200 million satellite was perplexing because it occurred before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. The actual launch was scheduled for two days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accident has complicated <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s operations with the International Space Station. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is one of two companies ferrying cargo to the space mission. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s next flight had been scheduled to launch this month but is postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> juggled its order for the next flight from the other company, <span class="companylink">Orbital ATK</span> of Dulles, Va., switching to a larger rocket that would allow additional cargo. That launch is scheduled for the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also has a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> contract to carry astronauts to the space station beginning as early as late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk indicated on Friday that the problem occurred during fueling. As liquid oxygen flowed into a tank on the second stage, the propellant was so cold that it froze solid, setting off a domino effect that destroyed the rocket in a succession of fireballs on the launchpad. At normal atmospheric pressures, oxygen turns solid at -362 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> released a statement that it was focusing the investigation on one of three helium containers within the oxygen tank. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated up and released to maintain pressure within the tank. The company said that its tests had replicated the rupture of the helium containers, made of carbon fiber composite materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It basically involves a combination of liquid helium, advanced carbon fiber composites and solid oxygen,'' Mr. Musk said. ''Oxygen so cold that it actually enters solid phase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk did not provide other details about how solid oxygen affected the carbon fiber composites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2015, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at -340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used for rocket propulsion. The lower temperatures make the oxygen denser and improve engine thrust, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the helium were in a liquid state, it would be even colder (-452 degrees), and that appears to have provided unintended additional cooling that turned some of the oxygen solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported this week that hazards could be greater for future astronauts riding on <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rockets. With supercooled fuel, the launch occurs soon after the fuel is pumped into the rocket. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has proposed that the astronauts would be strapped in before fueling begins instead of boarding after fueling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter last December, a space station advisory committee headed by retired Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford of the Air Force strongly and unanimously objected to that idea, saying it was ''contrary to booster safety criteria that has been in place for over 50 years, both in this country and internationally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> officials have suggested that a change of procedure would prevent a recurrence, and the rocket's launch abort system would have carried the astronauts to safety in case of an emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> resumes launching, the first flight will be for one of its commercial customers, but company officials have not said where the next launch will occur. The accident damaged the Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has used for almost all of its Falcon 9 launches so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has also been renovating Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches, and it also has a launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, the space station is not running short of supplies. But <span class="companylink">Orbital ATK</span> is recovering from its own mishap, when an Antares rocket with <span class="companylink">NASA</span> cargo exploded two years ago. It then launched two of its Cygnus cargo ships on a competitor's rocket, the Atlas 5 built by <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, and last month, it launched with a redesigned Antares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian and Japanese cargo ships are scheduled to head to the station before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Frank DeMauro, the vice president of Orbital ATK's advanced programs division, said that a couple of months ago, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials began discussions to launch the next cargo flight with an Atlas 5 instead of an Antares rocket. That would increase the cargo capacity by about 660 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeMauro said that an Atlas, which has a track record of more than 60 successful launches, would decrease the chances of delays. ''It highlights our focus on supporting our customer even if it means launching on another company's rocket,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting all that information back to Earth where scientists could study it took 15 months.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last bits of data -- an infrared scan of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, that tells something about the composition of the two -- arrived on Earth on Tuesday at 5:48 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well, you know, in our hearts, it's still there,'' Alice Bowman, the missions operations manager, said of Pluto, ''but our data is on the ground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, New Horizons made more than 400 scientific observations, most of them on July 14, 2015, when the spacecraft made its closest approach to Pluto, passing within 8,000 miles of the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft beamed back the highlights the next day, July 15 -- what the mission team cheekily called ''The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> data set,'' because they expected breathtaking images that would be splashed across the front page of The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>. (They were right.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists had to wait for the bulk of the data -- more than 50 billion bits -- because the radio signal from two 12-watt transmitters on a spacecraft more than three billion miles away is tenuously faint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In modern-day computing terms, 50 billion bits is not much -- 6.25 gigabytes, or what easily fits on a cheap USB flash drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spread over 469 days, the effective data rate was about 1,200 bits per second, on par with computer modems of the early 1980s. New Horizons was actually pushing the data at a somewhat faster pace, but it could not do so continuously, because it had to share <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s large radio dishes with other missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bowman said the scientists were checking one more time to make sure that they had everything, and then in a few weeks, a command would be sent to wipe the data memory banks clean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Horizons team is already planning for its next encounter on New Year's Day in 2019, passing within 2,000 miles of a distant clump of rock and ice known as 2014 MU69. So far, astronomers do not know much about 2014 MU69 beyond that it is tiny and red -- redder than Pluto though not quite as red as Mars -- and that it is part of what is known as the classical Kuiper belt, a disk of icy bodies beyond Neptune whose circular orbits appear undisturbed since the beginning of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. (Pluto by contrast, has been bullied by Neptune's gravity into an elliptical, tilted orbit with a travel time around the sun 1.5 times that of Neptune.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that they are the primordial remnants of the disk that formed the planets,'' Amanda M. Zangari, a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. working on the New Horizons mission, said during a news conference last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of New Horizons, declined to make predictions of what will be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on Hubble Space Telescope observations, astronomers guess its diameter to be 20 to 30 miles. That would make its mass about a thousandth of Pluto's, Dr. Stern said, yet 10,000 times the mass of Comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, which was studied by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Rosetta mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've never been to anything like MU69,'' Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists will have to wait awhile. With the greater distance from Earth and slower transmission rates, it will take 21 months, until September 2020, for New Horizons to get the data from that encounter back to Earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't be surprised if that was one of the key focus areas for him post-presidency,'' said Steve Case, a co-founder of AOL.</p>

Smith, a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who is now the United States chief technology officer, and Kurt DelBene, who left <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> in 2013 to manage Healthcare.gov and later returned to the tech company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Obama has also angered civil liberties advocates who grew to view him as the ''surveillance president,'' too willing to continue government programs, put in place after the terrorist attacks of 2001, that use technology to snoop on Americans. A report last week from the Center for Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law chided the F.B.I. and the police for assembling a face-recognition database system that contains more than 117 million American adults, half of all adults in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This president has presided over an era in which universal tracking is becoming more pervasive, not just from intelligence agencies but also at the level of local law enforcement,'' said Ben Wizner, the director of the speech, privacy and technology project at the American Civil Liberties Union and the chief legal adviser to Edward J. Snowden, a former government contractor who revealed in 2013 that United States intelligence agencies had created a mass surveillance system to comb through Americans' phone records and international internet traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public controversy that followed the disclosures emboldened some technology executives to stand up to government intrusion, leading to disagreements about how to ensure data security and privacy while meeting the needs of law enforcement. This year, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> refused to comply with an F.B.I. demand that the company unlock an iPhone during a terrorism investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that has not stopped Silicon Valley from keeping an open door for Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley start-up accelerator, suggested that the soon-to-be ex-president would be a good job candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd happily hire him,'' Mr. Altman joked, ''and give him a chance.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that ''space situational awareness'' is what a football player needs when he goes up for a pass in a crowd of 300-pound helmeted assassins. But to the Department of Defense, it has a more precise and chilling meaning: namely the need to identify and track the untold hundreds of thousands of objects inhabiting the not-so-empty space around our planet -- space junk, missile tests, dead rocket parts, foreign satellites of unknown intent and uncharted asteroids coming in for the kill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force operates a globe-girdling network of telescopes, radars and even two satellites to keep track of all this stuff.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tuesday, the latest addition to this sky patrol was unveiled at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico: the Space Surveillance Telescope, a 90-ton telescope powered by a 38,000-horsepower engine. Swiveling swiftly and almost silently like a ballerina, it can follow objects as small as a softball as they fly through the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new telescope, with an innovative mirror and detector array, represents a hundredfold improvement in the ability to see and track small objects in geosynchronous orbit and beyond, according to the <span class="companylink">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</span>, famous for its blue-sky efforts like the internet and GPS, which developed the telescope and is handing it over to the Air Force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years of testing in New Mexico, during which time it discovered 3,600 new asteroids -- including four that could eventually hit Earth -- the telescope will be installed next year in Australia, where it will fill a gap in surveillance of the Southern sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the telescope's heart is a 138-inch-diameter highly curved mirror, which has a wider field of view than previous surveillance telescopes. It moves the game, as Darpa said in a statement, ''from seeing only a few large objects at a time through the equivalent of a drinking straw, to a 'windshield' view with 10,000 objects at a time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result will be an avalanche of data, a terabyte a night, the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to this prodigious capability is a revolutionary curved detector, which could change the way astronomical telescopes are built in the future, astronomers say. Emmanuel Hugot of the Laboratory for Astrophysics in Marseille, France, called the Darpa telescope ''a real breakthrough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electronic detectors used in modern cameras and telescopes are imprinted on flat, rigid chips of silicon. When images from wide-field mirrors like the one in the new Darpa telescope are projected on such flat devices, however, they wind up distorted, the way Greenland looks too big on some maps of the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get rid of such distortions and ''flatten'' the light for conventional flat detectors, astronomers have traditionally had to add complicated optical systems to the back ends of their telescopes, making them more expensive to build and operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The detectors in the Darpa telescope, developed by the Lincoln Laboratory at M.I.T., are bendable, demonstrating a way for astronomers to simplify the design and operation of their telescopes, according to Dr. Hugot, the lead author of a paper on recent attempts to make them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hugot said European astronomers would be meeting this month to talk about how to incorporate curved detectors into the European Extremely Large Telescope, a behemoth under construction in Chile that will be the world's largest ground-based telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What remains to be seen is when the technologies developed by Darpa will spread to civilian astronomers. The main obstacles, Dr. Hugot and his colleagues said in their paper, were manufacturing costs and the need for a parallel commercial market that would make it worthwhile for big companies to invest.</p>

But actually, that plane is slightly tilted, and now astronomers think they know why: The elusive Planet Nine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year Michael Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, presented evidence that there may be a massive planet beyond Neptune orbiting the sun. The so-called Planet Nine is thought to be about 10 times the mass of Earth and about as large as Neptune. At its farthest point it is about 155 billion miles away from the sun.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that size and distance, this planet's mass would have large effects on the other planets orbiting the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so far away that it essentially gets this huge lever arm on the solar system, and it slowly tilts the planets in its direction,'' Dr. Brown said Wednesday during a joint meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>'s Division for Planetary Sciences and European Planetary Science Congress in Pasadena, Calif. ''It can tilt the solar system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight planets (sorry, Pluto) orbit the sun along a plane. From our position on Earth, it appears as if the sun is tilted at a six-degree angle against that plane. But according to Dr. Brown, it's actually the planets that are tilted, because of Planet Nine's gravity. He said it was one of many effects that the elusive planet had on the solar system, and a clue to proving its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really hard for me to think that the solar system could be doing all that it's doing without there being a massive planet out there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renu Malhotra, a planetary scientist from the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>, also presented clues at the presentation that point to the existence of Planet Nine. She said there are four objects deep in the Kuiper Belt, which is a minefield of ice and debris beyond Neptune, that orbit the sun in a synchronized pattern, or orbital resonance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Malhotra said the only way these extreme Kuiper Belt objects could orbit in the pattern that they do is if ''they are in resonance with an unseen massive planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers know that it takes those objects about 10,000 years to orbit the sun. If her findings are correct, that would mean that Planet Nine orbits the sun about once every 17,117 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown said he thinks that Planet Nine is within the reach of giant telescopes and that astronomers will find it sometime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the end of next winter,'' he said, ''there will be enough people looking at it that I think somebody will track this down.''</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings include images showing seven small, bright spots that might be clouds floating just above Pluto's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons had already discovered haze in Pluto's tenuous atmosphere, rising more than 120 miles into the sky and separated into at least 24 distinct layers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But hazes are not clouds,'' S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of New Horizons, said during a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hazes spread out and do not block sunlight. If you were to stand on Pluto and look upward, its haze would filter only 2 percent of the light, Dr. Stern said. A cloud, on the other hand, is a puff that you cannot see through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crystal-clear images that New Horizons took during its flyby in July 2015 showed that Pluto was almost entirely cloud-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But careful sifting of high-resolution images revealed seven possible clouds, although Dr. Stern said there was no way to know for sure. All seven are bright features of similar size -- on the order of miles -- and all occurred near dawn or dusk, perhaps times when Plutonian clouds are more likely to form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't see any decks or banks of clouds,'' Dr. Stern said. ''We see individual, discrete potential cloud features.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonnie J. Buratti, an astronomer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, also noted the widely ranging reflectivity of Pluto's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regions near the Equator reflect just 8 percent of the sunlight, while places in Sputnik Planitia, the western half of the heart-shape feature on Pluto, are as bright as fresh snow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at the space agency had not been optimistic about the fate of the Schiaparelli lander but lacked conclusive evidence that it had been destroyed. During its six-minute trip through the Martian atmosphere, the lander at first appeared to be operating well, but it stopped sending data after the ejection of its heat shield.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli was part of ExoMars 2016, a joint mission by the European and Russian space agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, passing overhead, took photographs of the area, which revealed two new features on the landscape, compared with what the orbiter had seen in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One was a bright spot, probably Schiaparelli's 40-foot parachute. The other was a fuzzy dark patch about 50 feet by 130 feet, just over half a mile north of the parachute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is interpreted as arising from the impact of the Schiaparelli module itself following a much longer free fall than planned, after the thrusters were switched off prematurely,'' the space agency said in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli fell from an estimated altitude of 1.2 to 2.5 miles, hitting the ground at a speed greater than 186 miles an hour, the space agency said, creating the large, dark blemish. The lander, with its propellent tanks mostly full, may have exploded on impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These preliminary interpretations will be refined following further analysis,'' the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is expected to pass over again next week and will take more detailed photographs with a high-resolution camera. Engineers are examining the final communications from Schiaparelli for clues to what went wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash is the space agency's second failure in two tries at landing on Mars. On Christmas Day 2003, the Beagle 2 lander headed for the surface but was not heard from again. Last year, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found the lander on the ground, partly deployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ExoMars is still a success, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other part of the mission, an orbiter to measure trace gases in the Martian atmosphere, entered orbit above Mars on Wednesday, and its science investigations will continue unaffected by the demise of Schiaparelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study of the atmosphere's trace gases may yield important clues to the geological processes on Mars, as well as possible hints that microbes thrive somewhere on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli was a test of a landing system for future missions to Mars. A weather station on the lander also was to have made measurements of the atmosphere for a few days until the batteries drained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure does not directly affect another ExoMars mission in 2020 to put a rover on the surface of Mars. That landing system is a different design, conceived and built by the Russians.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other part of the spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter, has been transmitting data since it entered orbit around Mars on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Following yesterday's events, we have an impressive orbiter around Mars ready for science and for relay support for the ExoMars rover mission in 2020,'' Johann-Dietrich Wörner, director general of the European Space Agency, said in a statement. ''Schiaparelli's primary role was to test European landing technologies. Recording the data during the descent was part of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that it was important to ''learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future,'' but said that it would take time for officials to decode the data. The mission is a joint effort by the European and Russian space agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Parker, the European agency's director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration, said that ''we have data coming back that allow us to fully understand the steps that did occur, and why the soft landing did not occur,'' and that a board of inquiry would ''dig deeper into the data.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli's mother ship will remain in orbit to analyze gases in the planet's atmosphere, an effort that could answer questions like whether the planet has ever supported life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atmosphere of Mars makes it tricky to land a spacecraft there. It is thick enough to heat an arriving lander to thousands of degrees, yet too thin for parachutes to provide a gentle descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, spacecraft designers have had to devise complex landing systems for Mars, including retrorockets, giant airbags like those used by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Spirit and Opportunity rovers, and the Rube Goldberg-esque ''sky crane'' that lowered the Curiosity rover to the Martian surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of Schiaparelli would not directly affect the ExoMars 2020 mission, which will rely on a different landing system developed and built by the Russians. But that too is as yet unproven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> so far is the only space agency to explore the surface of Mars, beginning with the Viking landers in 1976 through the arrival of Curiosity in 2012 -- seven successful landings in all. (The Soviet Union did manage to land its Mars 3 lander in 1971, but the spacecraft died seconds later.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">NASA</span> spends considerably more on its missions, wringing out as many possible problems as its engineers can think of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Curiosity mission cost $2.5 billion. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s next rover, largely a clone of Curiosity with different instruments, will cost at least $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the price tag for the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s 2016 and 2020 ExoMars missions -- for the orbiter and lander in 2016, and the rover in 2020 -- is about $1.4 billion. (That does not include the Russian contributions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">NASA</span> attempted Mars landings on the cheap, it too failed. The Mars Polar Lander, which cost $110 million, crashed in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inadequate testing failed to uncover design flaws, an investigation concluded, including the one that is thought to have doomed the lander. The unfolding of its landing legs high above the surface may have inadvertently set off a sensor that turned off its engine, and the lander plunged to its demise. Two basketball-size probes released by Polar Lander also failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not yet clear what happened to Schiaparelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early indications from radio signals captured by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India, and from the orbiter suggest that the landing module ''successfully completed most steps of its six-minute descent through the Martian atmosphere,'' including deceleration through the atmosphere and the deployment of its parachute and heat shield, E.S.A. officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet both sets of signals ceased shortly before the module was to have settled to the surface. Discrepancies between the two data sets are being analyzed at the agency's space operations center in Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli appears to have ejected its back heat shield and unfurled its parachute, officials said early Thursday morning. But the thrusters may have shut down sooner than expected.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ExoMars 2016, a joint mission of the European and Russian space agencies that launched in March on a Russian rocket from Kazakhstan, consists of an orbiter and a lander that arrived at the red planet on Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trace Gas Orbiter pulled in around Mars as planned, to cheers and fist pumps at the mission's center in Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a good capture,'' Michel Denis, the ExoMars flight director, said shortly after the signal arrived at 12:35 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of hours later, Mr. Denis confirmed that the orbiter was almost exactly in the targeted orbit and that everything appeared to be operating well. ''We have a mission around Mars,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fate of the lander remains unknown. No radio signal has yet been received to indicate the spacecraft made it to the surface in working order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The European Space Agency</span>, which built the Schiaparelli lander, has never successfully planted a spacecraft on Mars. Schiaparelli separated from the orbiter on Sunday and was to have set down just before 11 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft had been sending information back during its descent, and officials say the parachutes deployed. But then the signal, received by a radio dish in Pune, India, disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At a certain point, it stopped,'' said Paolo Ferri, head of the mission operations department. ''It was unexpected, but we couldn't conclude anything from that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiaparelli also sent its data to Mars Express, an older European orbiter, and Mars Express relayed what it heard to Earth. Again, the signal ended abruptly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It stopped at a certain point that we reckon was before the landing,'' Dr. Ferri said. ''To conclude more on this, we need more information. It is clear these are not good signs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trace Gas Orbiter recorded full telemetry information from Schiaparelli during the landing attempt, and that was to be sent back to Earth later on Wednesday. Engineers were to spend the night analyzing the data, and Dr. Ferri said he was confident that there would be answers in time for a morning news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars is littered with the wreckage of crashed landers, including the European Beagle 2 probe, lost in 2003. So far, there have been seven successful missions on the surface of Mars -- all by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soviet Union came close in December 1971 with its Mars 3 mission. The lander made it down in one piece, but then malfunctioned 20 seconds after landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thin atmosphere of Mars makes landing tricky. It is thick enough to heat an arriving spacecraft to thousands of degrees, yet too thin for parachutes to provide a gentle descent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the lander Schiaparelli failed, it will not have a major impact on the overall success of the mission. The main purpose of Schiaparelli is to test landing technologies for future missions, and its batteries were expected to be drained after a few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary scientific value of ExoMars was expected to come from the orbiter's observations as it searches for methane and other gases in the Martian atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transient methane has been detected on the planet, presumably produced by a geological process requiring heat and liquid water or, even more exciting, by microbes. More evidence of the gas on Mars could provide important clues about the planet's geology, or even offer hints of life there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither the orbiter nor the lander -- if it is intact -- will want for company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, two rovers sent by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> are exploring Mars's dunes and craters. Opportunity, active since 2004, has lasted 12 years beyond its planned expiration date. Curiosity, which landed in 2012, has drilled into the planet's surface and discovered organic chemicals essential to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company in orbit includes the Mars Express orbiter, launched in 2003, and three <span class="companylink">NASA</span> craft: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Odyssey and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission, or Maven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Indian probe, the Mars Orbiter Mission, has also orbited the planet since 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years ahead, a variety of space agencies and private companies have announced plans for further exploration of the solar system's fourth planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2018, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> plans to land the InSight probe on Mars to study the planet's interior processes. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> also is looking to drop one of its Dragon capsules on the surface, a test that could lead to a much larger spacecraft carrying colonists there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe and Russia have an ambitious follow-up to the ExoMars collaboration that is to launch in 2020 and land in April 2021. That mission will consist of a rover and a surface science platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be a busy period for Mars. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, India, China and the United Arab Emirates also are looking to launch spacecraft to the planet then.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hours before a close flyby of Jupiter on Wednesday, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Juno spacecraft experienced a malfunction that scrambled plans for peering deep into the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1:47 a.m. Eastern, the spacecraft put itself into ''safe mode'' and restarted its computer. Juno's instruments shut down, scuttling observations that were to take place as it passed 3,000 miles above Jupiter's clouds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials said that Juno appeared healthy, however, and engineers were working to pinpoint what went wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The spacecraft is in totally safe condition,'' said Scott Bolton of <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in San Antonio, the mission's principal investigator, at a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computer problem followed a glitch that led mission managers last week to put off one last firing of Juno's main engine in order to refine its orbit. Occurring at closest approach, that engine burn would have shortened Juno's orbit, bringing it close to Jupiter every 14 days instead of every 53.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each close pass, instruments on Juno are to peer beneath Jupiter's dense clouds. With enough passes, scientists should be able to piece together a picture of the planet's composition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the propulsion system was being turned on last week, there were problems with valves that regulate the flow of helium that pressurizes the engine fuel. Two valves took several minutes to open, instead of a few seconds, raising concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to better understand this issue before moving forward with a burn of the main engine,'' Rick Nybakken, the Juno project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next opportunity to shorten the orbit will be during Juno's close approach on Dec. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno launched on Aug. 5, 2011, and entered orbit around Jupiter on July 4. On Aug. 27, the spacecraft made the first close swing by Jupiter with its instruments turned on. Even that one pass has revealed interesting hints about the solar system's largest planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno measured radio waves emanating from 215 to 250 miles below Jupiter's colorful striped cloud tops. The data shows that these mysterious stripes descend toward the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whatever is making those colors, whatever is making those stripes, is still existing pretty far down into Jupiter,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Juno's camera provided the first clear pictures of Jupiter's polar regions. A huge hexagonal cloud pattern sits over Saturn's north pole, and scientists had wondered if similar patterns might appear on Jupiter. So far they have not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Juno did observe a cyclone that rose higher than the surrounding clouds like a thunderhead, casting a shadow. The storm was nearly 4,000 miles across. ''That's more than half the size of the earth,'' Dr. Bolton said. ''It is a truly towering beast of a storm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bolton said that even if there turned out to be a serious failure with the engine and Juno needed to remain in its current orbit, the mission could achieve its scientific objectives, but it would take longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The worst-case scenario is I have to be patient,'' Dr. Bolton said.</p>

In addition to searing surface temperatures, wind in the upper atmosphere howls at up to 250 miles per hour, carrying clouds around the planet once every four days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Venus itself spins very slowly: one rotation every 243 Earth days -- in the wrong direction, no less, opposite to almost every other body in the solar system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the whole, the atmosphere on Earth rotates about the same speed as the planet. So why does the air on slow-spinning Venus speed around so much faster than the planet itself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese space probe Akatsuki, now in orbit around Venus, seeks to solve the mystery of so-called super-rotation. Scientists working on the mission are presenting some of their early findings at a meeting this week of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>'s Division for Planetary Sciences in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not just an idle trivia question for planetary scientists. Computer models of our own weather fail when applied to Venus, and knowledge of the planet's workings could better our understanding of Earth's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't know what is the missing point in meteorology,'' said Masato Nakamura, Akatsuki's project manager. ''If we know what makes such a super-rotation, we will have a much deeper understanding of the atmospheric dynamics, not just on Venus but also on Earth. We will learn much more about the Earth climate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, Venus has been a backwater of planetary exploration, even though it is much closer in size to Earth than is Mars. For a long time, scientists imagined there could be a habitable tropical paradise beneath Venus's thick clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1950s, intense thermal emissions, measured by a radio telescope on Earth, told a different story. Venus broils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average surface temperature is more than 850 degrees Fahrenheit -- an extreme demonstration of the heat-trapping prowess of carbon dioxide, the primary constituent of the Venusian atmosphere. Clouds of sulfuric acid make it an even less appealing place to visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Magellan spacecraft precisely mapped the topography of Venus through radar. Except for a few flybys by spacecraft on the way to somewhere else, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has not returned to Venus, although the agency is considering two modest proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European mission, Venus Express, studied the planet from 2006 to 2014, discovering among other things a frigid layer of atmosphere, minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit at an altitude of 75 miles, sandwiched between two warmer layers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now Akatsuki, which entered orbit last December, has begun its work. Takehiko Satoh, one of the mission scientists, said that one of ''the most exciting, most surprising results'' so far came almost immediately after the spacecraft arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The camera that captures long-wavelength infrared light from the cloud tops discovered an arc-shaped white streak that stretched some 6,000 miles from nearly the south pole to nearly the north pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, this giant atmospheric feature does not move with the atmosphere. ''It seems to be fixed to the ground Dr. Satoh said. The arc sits above Aphrodite Terra, a highland region about the size of Africa that rises up to three miles from the surface. Scientists working on data from the Venus Express reported a similar finding in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility is that as the wind blows over Aphrodite Terra, clouds are pushed higher and the temperature of the cloud tops falls. ''Our interpretation is there is some disturbance from the high mountain,'' Dr. Nakamura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Satoh said there were primarily two competing ideas for where the energy for the Venus wind comes from. One is that energy coming from the sun accelerates the wind. The second is that atmosphere is so thick that it gradually slows down the spinning of the planet, and that angular momentum is transferred to the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to this theory, even though breezes on the surface are slight -- a couple of miles per hour -- the speeds increase at higher altitudes as the air thins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small spacecraft -- the main body is a box a bit bigger than a refrigerator -- carries five cameras, collecting light at different wavelengths to monitor the Venusian atmosphere at different altitudes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another experiment, scientists will observe how the radio signal from the spacecraft to Earth is distorted when it passes through the atmosphere. That will reveal temperature, abundance of sulfuric acid vapor and other properties. By observing the atmosphere at different altitudes, they can detect wavelike features that rise and fall, like blobs in a lava lamp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the solar heating or thermal tide hypothesis is correct,'' Dr. Satoh said, ''we may see different propagation of the wave, from cloud top to the lower level.'' If the viscosity theory is correct, the waves should propagate in the opposite direction, from the ground to the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the answers will become clear in a year -- or maybe four. ''We need to analyze a lot of big data,'' Dr. Nakamura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Akatsuki, which means ''dawn'' in Japanese, is there at all is the result of ingenuity and perseverance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It launched in May 2010 and arrived at Venus seven months later. But when its main engine failed to fire properly, it sailed right past the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a very sad moment,'' Dr. Satoh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a day, Dr. Satoh said, calculations indicated that in six years, Akatsuki, in orbit around the sun instead of Venus, could meet up with Venus again. But it was not clear the spacecraft still would be able to slow down and enter orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investigation found that a valve in the engine had leaked, leading to the formation of salts that fused it shut. The engine, as it fired, had overheated beyond repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Akatsuki still had the maneuvering thrusters that were to be used after it entered orbit. They were not as powerful as the broken engine, but they could apply enough force to slow it down enough so that Venus' gravity could capture it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of worries that the longer stay in space, with the bombardment of solar radiation and cosmic rays, would degrade the instruments, the craft was maneuvered so the second rendezvous would occur a year earlier, in November 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then calculations suggested that orbit might not be stable, and the spacecraft might crash into Venus shortly afterward. Another adjustment pushed the arrival back a couple of weeks to Dec. 7, exactly five years after the original arrival date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, everything worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Akatsuki's orbit is different from the one originally envisioned. Instead of being synchronized to the spinning atmosphere, which would have allowed scientists to better track small changes, the spacecraft now loops around Venus in a large elliptical orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That provides different benefits. Instead of intently staring at one spot, seeing the smallest changes, scientists are now able to see what happens on a global scale, although they will miss some of the details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Akatsuki is to continue operating until at least April 2018, depending on how much fuel it has left. ''We know at least we have one kilogram of fuel,'' said Dr. Nakamura, likening the uncertainty to an imprecise fuel gauge in a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it turns out that Akatsuki has more, the spacecraft could continue operating for perhaps up to six years, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,'' he wrote.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is not new: The president laid out the same goal in 2010 during a speech at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the column on Tuesday, along with a joint blog post by senior White House and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials, offered new details on how the United States expected to reach the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> awarded contracts to six companies to develop habitats that could eventually sustain astronauts on deep-space missions like Mars. On Tuesday, John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser, and Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, announced that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> would also allow private companies to hitch their own modules to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next decade, the officials added, work aboard the space station will move into a stage in which new technologies will be tested in the stretch of space between Earth and the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, plenty of challenges remain. Here are some answers to the most pressing questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is travel to Mars even possible?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes. For decades, a human mission to Mars has been regarded as difficult but doable, given enough time and money and a willingness to subject astronauts to risks like radiation during the long journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then why aren't we there already?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his article, President Obama quoted John Noble Wilford, the New York Times reporter who covered the Apollo moon landings in the 1960s and '70s. Mars tugs at the imagination ''with a force mightier than gravity,'' Mr. Wilford wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wernher von Braun, the mastermind of Apollo, sketched out plans for reaching Mars, too. Back then, many people thought the journey would move from the moon to Mars in a decade or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But President Richard M. Nixon pared back <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s grand ambitions, leaving just the space shuttle. Astronauts have not ventured beyond low-Earth orbit since 1972, when the crew of Apollo 17 returned home after a 12-day trip to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, President George Bush announced an initiative to send astronauts back to the moon and then onward to Mars. When <span class="companylink">NASA</span> came back with a plan that was rumored to cost half a trillion dollars over two to three decades, the initiative faded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main challenge is not technical; it is political and financial. If Congress was to provide steady funding for the next 20 years, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> could probably finish the task. But changes in presidential administrations have generally led to re-examination and changes in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s marching orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the flush years at the height of the Apollo program, peaking at 4.4 percent of the federal budget in 1966, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s budget today is steady and comparatively small: The $19.3 billion for the space agency this year amounts to about 0.5 percent of federal spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Won't <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> get there sooner?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the International Astronautical Congress last month in Guadalajara, Mexico, Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, announced his architecture for a giant rocket and spaceship -- what he called the Interplanetary Transport System -- that would take colonists to Mars, 100 at a time. The trips could begin as soon as 2024, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk was confident, but that was a highly optimistic timeline. His smaller, workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, has had two catastrophic failures in the past two years. A larger rocket under development, the Falcon Heavy, is years behind schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> still has to prove new technologies, like the ability to land big spacecraft on Mars. And Mr. Musk was vague about how his company would pay for all this. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is still fairly small in size and profits, and Mr. Musk conceded that he would need to rely on ''a huge public-private partnerships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has <span class="companylink">NASA</span> been preparing for a trip to Mars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, but the pace has been slow. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has never received a large infusion of money to pursue a trip to Mars. And while the destination has not changed, the details certainly have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last couple years, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> news releases, web pages and social media postings have been festooned with the #JourneyToMars hashtag, tying a multitude of projects to the long-term goal of sending astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the Obama administration scuttled the rockets and crew capsule that were to have been part of the canceled Constellation program in favor of developing better technologies for space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of Congress objected, particularly those from Texas and Florida, home to big <span class="companylink">NASA</span> facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Orion crew capsule from the Constellation program was revived, and Congress instructed <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to start work on the Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket similar to the one that would have been built for the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first launch of the Space Launch System, without a crew, is scheduled for late 2018. The second launch, with astronauts, would be at least three years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency is only now filling in details of what it would like to do on subsequent deep-space missions between Earth and the moon, which it calls ''the proving ground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When might the work begin in earnest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating the International Space Station costs <span class="companylink">NASA</span> $3 billion to $4 billion a year. Ditching the station -- which <span class="companylink">NASA</span> plans to do in 2024 -- would free up money to build the other big pieces for a human Mars mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a team at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory presented a proposal on how the agency could get to Mars in the early 2030s with its existing budget, along with increases to keep pace with inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would not be enough for the astronauts to land on Mars, as a lander would be too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, engineers at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, building upon the pieces that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> is developing, offered a proposal to send a spacecraft into orbit around Mars by 2028. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> officials are not yet convinced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the International Astronautical Congress meeting, William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said he expected <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronauts in orbit around Mars in the 2030s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a landing will not occur until the 2040s, he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDA scientific research consortium on Tuesday announced plans to build and launch a privately financed telescope the size of a small washing machine in hopes of finding an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system, one of our closest cosmic neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, the chief executive of the BoldlyGo Institute, one of two nonprofits leading the consortium, called it ''the holy grail of exoplanet research.'' If there is a ''pale blue dot'' -- a world covered in oceans -- at Alpha Centauri, the telescope would permit scientists to study it in detail, looking for signs of life in the light reflected off the atmosphere.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be built by the end of the decade, the telescope is the type of mission that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> rarely undertakes, experts noted: tightly focused and cheap, leading to momentous discoveries -- or possibly nothing at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two stars of the Alpha Centauri system are both similar to the sun, the closest such stars at 4.37 light-years away. The proposed telescope, with a mirror only about 20 inches across, would be able to make out Earth-size planets orbiting in the stars' so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are warm enough for liquid water to flow at the surface and, hypothetically, for life to thrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Kepler mission has discovered a multitude of Earth-size planets in the galaxy, and in August astronomers using ground-based telescopes announced the discovery of a potentially habitable planet around Proxima Centauri, our closest neighbor at a distance of 4.22 light-years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Proxima Centauri is much smaller and dimmer than our sun, and the planet, even if similar in size to Earth, would not be particularly Earthlike. It orbits much closer to the star, likely with one side perpetually in daylight and the other eternally dark. Because the planet is so close to its star, the proposed telescope would not be able to study it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, most exoplanets have been discovered indirectly, deduced by slight perturbations in the light traveling from a star -- by a slight dimming when the exoplanet passes between its star and Earth, or by wobbles in the light's wavelengths caused by the gravitational pull of an unseen exoplanet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronomers could photograph a planet directly, they could start to look for specific wavelengths of light that serve as fingerprints of specific molecules. Detection of oxygen in the atmosphere would argue for photosynthesis and plants, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morse said the proposed telescope, called Project Blue, would most likely cost $25 million to $50 million, perhaps one-third the cost of a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> mission with similar goals. That is still a lot of money, and not easily raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding through small individual donations might cover some of the early design work, he said, but ''we do have to approach high-net-worth individuals and foundations.'' Participating institutions, like the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, could also offer in-kind contributions to the project rather than cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of a telescope pointed at Alpha Centauri is not new. Ruslan Belikov, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., has been working for years as principal investigator on the Alpha Centauri Exoplanet Satellite, or ACESat, developing the technology needed to pick out planets in a binary star system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ACESat project has not won <span class="companylink">NASA</span> approval, however. Eduardo Bendek, ACESat's deputy principal investigator, estimated that there was a 15 percent chance that there are no planets in the habitable zones of the two Alpha Centauri stars. ''<span class="companylink">NASA</span> is very averse to that risk,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce the chances of discovering nothing, the ACESat team proposed a mission that would examine not just Alpha Centauri but also a few other nearby stars. But expanding the mission -- plus other considerations to reduce risks -- increased the price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Belikov and Dr. Bendek declined to provided specific figures, but said the total budget fit under the required $175 million cost cap when they submitted the proposal to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Small Explorer astrophysics program in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> selected three other missions for further study. ACESat remains unbuilt, and the next opportunity to submit a proposal is most likely in 2019, Dr. Belikov and Dr. Bendek said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't speak for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>,'' Dr. Beikov said, ''but speaking personally, I'm excited about the possibility of doing space missions privately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, privately financed space missions have met with limited success. Competitors in the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, to send the first private spacecraft to the moon, have had trouble finding backers. <span class="companylink">Planetary Resources</span>, a Seattle company aiming to mine asteroids, withdrew a plan for a crowdfunded space telescope, sending back contributions collected on Kickstarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another project, Lunar Mission One, intended to send a robotic lander to the moon's south pole, successfully raised about $1 million via Kickstarter, but probably needs more than 600 times as much to pull it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BoldlyGo is also pursuing two more ambitious projects -- a larger space telescope, and a spacecraft to collect samples from the Martian atmosphere and bring them back to Earth -- that have not yet gotten off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morse, who once ran <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s astrophysics division, agrees that Project Blue will not be easy, but says it is possible. For more than a century, he notes, astronomers have relied on the generosity of rich benefactors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All we're doing is borrowing the model that ground-based astronomy has been using literally since the time of John Quincy Adams,'' Dr. Morse said. ''We think that quest is worthy, and we're going to try to do it with private funding.''</p>

Bezos, the billionaire chief executive of Amazon, successfully separated a crew capsule from a rocket after it had lifted off on Wednesday, an important step toward Blue Origin's goal of carrying tourists into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before putting anyone on board its spacecraft, the company wants to make sure that its rockets' launch-abort system will carry passengers to safety if anything goes wrong during a flight.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like the airbag in your car,'' Ariane Cornell said as she helped host Blue Origin's webcast of the test. ''It provides some peace of mind, but you're only going to use it if there's an emergency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said it was the first in-flight test of an abort system since those conducted by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Apollo program in the 1960s. The Apollo tests also did not carry any people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's launch was the latest for Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft, which was designed to take space tourists on a suborbital jaunt across the boundary 62 miles above Earth that is regarded as the edge of outer space. The tourists would see the curvature of the planet and the blackness of space while experiencing a few minutes of floating at the top of the arc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin tested the escape system in 2012, but that was while the capsule was resting on a launchpad. This time, the capsule separated in flight, during the most stressful portion of the upward trajectory -- 45 seconds after ignition, at an altitude of 16,000 feet, when the rocket was passing the speed of sound and experiencing maximum air pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solid-fuel rocket at the bottom of the crew capsule fired for 1.8 seconds, exerting 70,000 pounds of force to quickly separate the capsule and steer it out of the way of the booster. Its parachutes deployed, and the capsule landed softly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there had been any people aboard, ''it would have been exciting, certainly,'' Ms. Cornell said, ''but most importantly, you'd be safe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booster had not been expected to survive, but it managed to right itself, continue on to space, and then, firing its engine again, land a couple of miles north of the launchpad in West Texas, a bit charred but intact. Still, neither the capsule nor the booster will fly again. Improved versions will be ready for future test flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin is developing reusable rockets to reduce the cost of reaching space. This booster had launched four times previously, and the capsule had made six previous flights, including the 2012 test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By starting with a small suborbital rocket, the company is gaining experience in developing and launching reusable spacecraft. Test flights with people may begin as early as next year, and paying passengers, six at a time, may start coming aboard as early as 2018. Blue Origin has not yet announced a price for tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has announced that a larger rocket, New Glenn, capable of taking people and cargo to orbit, is to start launching from Cape Canaveral, Fla., by the end of the decade. An even larger rocket, New Armstrong, is on the drawing board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos has said his vision is for millions of people to eventually live and work in space.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThirty years ago, amid the somber prayers of Judaism's holiest day, Rabbi Kenneth Berger rose to deliver the Yom Kippur sermon. He spoke to his congregants about a tragedy many of them, including his daughter, had witnessed eight months earlier in the Florida sky: the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rabbi Berger focused on one particular detail, the revelation that Challenger's seven astronauts had remained alive for the 65,000-foot fall to the ocean. He called the homily ''Five Minutes to Live,'' and he likened the crew members to Jews, who are called during the High Holy Days to engage in the process of ''heshbon ha-nefesh,'' Hebrew for taking stock of one's soul.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Can you imagine knowing that in a few moments death was imminent?'' Rabbi Berger said at the Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Tampa, Fla. ''What would we think of if, God forbid, you and I were in such circumstances? What would go through our mind?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not quite three years later, Rabbi Berger was on a flight to Chicago from Denver returning from a family vacation. The plane's tail engine exploded en route, crippling the controls, and for 40 minutes, the passengers prepared for a crash landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rabbi's wife, Aviva, fainted from the shock. Rabbi Berger reached across the seats and gathered the hands of his daughter Avigail, 16, and son Jonathan, 9, trying to reassure them, Avigail would later recall. The plane burst into flames after it hit the ground in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 people, including the rabbi and his wife, both in their early 40s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jews enter the Days of Awe, which begin at sundown on Sunday, Rabbi Berger's sermon on the Challenger has achieved a piercing and eerie kind of immortality. Between its eloquence and its prophecy, ''Five Minutes to Live'' continues to be cited, written about and delivered as a tribute, especially during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the sermon's theme and its presentiment of the rabbi's death resonate with the theological essence of the High Holy Days. In his sermon, Rabbi Berger plucked several well-known sentences of the liturgy, rearranging them for heightened effect: ''Who shall live and who shall die? Who shall attain the measure of a man's days and who shall not? On Rosh Hashana, it is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur, it is sealed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are hungry for guidance in living a life that matters,'' said Rabbi Edward Bernstein of Temple Torat Emet in Boynton Beach, Fla. ''Rabbi Berger, in his words, inspired people to action. And his death made those words holy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judaism is hardly unique among world religions in urging its believers to undertake a moral inventory. Catholics participate in confession, formally called the sacrament of reconciliation, while Muslims call the process of repentance by the Arabic word ''tawbah,'' which means ''turning back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is unusual in the American Jewish idiom is that heshbon ha-nefesh is addressed by rabbis on the two holidays each year when synagogue attendance grows exponentially. Mindful of another autumn ritual, Rabbi Berger called it ''the World Series.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Berger, who grew up in suburban Philadelphia, was ordained by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and took on the pulpit of Rodeph Sholom in 1983.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There he made his reputation as a trusted confidant for congregants in crises who could also code-switch into donning a Big Bird costume to entertain the children. He boiled down Judaic erudition to aphorisms like ''There's no roof overhead unless you build it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invariably chewing a straw and clutching a pen, he drafted his sermons on a yellow legal pad, and then read them over the phone to his father in Pennsylvania. When the rabbi's words really connected to his synagogue audience, he would permit himself a brief moment of ego, telling his children, ''I hit a home run.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 16, 1986, the day Rabbi Berger delivered ''Five Minutes to Live,'' the Challenger tragedy was fresh in the minds of his congregants. From that shared memory, Rabbi Berger extrapolated in both prosaic and profound directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He touched on the ordinary ways that people forget to express love for their families, blithely assuming there will always be another day. He recounted the story of a Jewish father, facing imminent death during the Holocaust, who bestowed a final kiss on the young son he was sending away to safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That scene still haunts me,'' Rabbi Berger said as the sermon closed, returning to the Challenger. ''The explosion and then five minutes. If only I... If only I... And then the capsule hits the water, it's all over. Then you realize it's all the same -- five minutes, five days, 50 years. It's all the same, for it's over before we realize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'''If only I knew' -- yes, my friends, it may be the last time. 'If only I realized' -- yes, stop, appreciate the blessings you have. 'If only I could' -- you still can, you've got today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Rabbi Berger and his wife died on July 19, 1989, his brother Samuel and sister-in-law Trisanne stepped in to take care of the family. The rabbi's middle child, Ilana, then 13, had been at camp at the time of the crash. Avigail spent a month in a coma from her injuries, awakening to the absence of her mother or father at her bedside. Jonathan suffered lesser injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel Berger found the text for ''Five Minutes to Live'' while cleaning out his brother's office. The sermon made its way to Avigail, who laminated it and keeps it in her jewelry box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sermon also took on its public life. Rabbi Michael Swarttz of Temple B'nai Shalom in Braintree, Mass., quoted large portions of it in his homily on Yom Kippur in 1989. Rabbi Larry Pinsker of Congregation Beit Tikvah in Baltimore assembled a ''book of remembrance'' about Rabbi Berger, in which many contributors mentioned the sermon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rabbi Mel Glazer of Colorado Springs, Colo., included part of the sermon in his 2013 book, ''A GPS for Grief and Healing.'' Twice in the last two years, Rabbi Bernstein in Florida has referred to ''Five Minutes to Live'' in online essays -- one on the 30th anniversary of the Challenger tragedy, the other after the mysterious disappearance of a <span class="companylink">Malaysia Airlines</span> flight in 2014 over the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I find it in hindsight even more moving than when I heard it,'' said Marty Solomon, who was president of Rodeph Sholom in 1986. ''As much as anything else, it's a living legacy from Kenny. It's universal and it will be forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 4, 2016, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The On Religion column on Sunday, about a sermon on waiting to die, misstated, in some editions, the surname of a rabbi who included part of the sermon in his 2013 book and it misidentified his hometown in Colorado.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio signals from Rosetta flatlined at 7:19 a.m. Eastern after it did a soft belly-flop onto Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at a speed of two miles per hour, slower than the average walk.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last few minutes, people at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, watched their computer screens mostly in silence, but with some nervous chatter. When the radio signals ceased, they applauded and hugged in a celebration that was part joyous, part somber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is it,'' said Patrick Martin, the mission manager. ''I can announce the full success of this historic descent of Rosetta toward 67P, and I declare the primary mission operations ended for Rosetta.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Rosetta went silent, it collected and sent back one last batch of data and images, including some very close-up shots of the comet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last photograph was taken at a height of 167 feet and was blurry because the camera was designed for viewing from a distance, not close up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's 12-year journey -- it took a decade to get there -- concluded with quite a few firsts, and quite a few fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets are frozen remnants that hold secrets about the early solar system, and Rosetta was the first spacecraft to do more than just whiz by one. Scientists have learned a lot from Rosetta's discoveries, adding pieces to the puzzle of how the planets came together and how life arrived on Earth. One of Rosetta's key findings is that comets are probably not the source of Earth's water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet 67P, which likely formed outside of Neptune, was one of the few with an orbit that could be matched by a spacecraft. It is only the second Kuiper belt object to be visited by a spacecraft -- Pluto was the first, by <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons mission last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years of observation revealed a dormant comet coming to life as it neared the sun and heated up, shooting geysers of dust and gas off its surface. Scientists learned that its shape, resembling a rubber duck, most likely occurred when two comets bumped into each other at a low velocity and stuck together.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After making its closest approach to the sun in August 2015, Comet 67P is now on the outward leg of its orbit. As sunlight grew more faint, Rosetta was less able to generate power from its solar panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers decided on a dive to collect one last batch of data: close-up observations of mysterious pits that appear similar to sinkholes on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The camera was expected to make out features as a small as one inch wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be interesting to get to look into the interior of the pits,'' Mohamed Ramy El-Maarry, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland, and a member of the team working with Rosetta's high-resolution camera, said during a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instrument that collected and studied dust particles had already been turned off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a series of presentations on Thursday, mission scientists described some of their findings, including a variety of ''magical landscapes'' along with an overall emptiness. They released audio of a ''cosmic song,'' created by the magnetic fields oscillating in the trail of particles flying off the comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valerie Ciarletti of the UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay, who helped investigate the comet's interior with radio waves, said the inside of Comet 67P is about as porous as fresh, powdery snow -- 70 percent of the volume is empty space. ''It's very fluffy material,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts of the surface, like the rocky region where Rosetta's lander Philae wound up, are more dense, with a porosity lower than 50 percent. ''It could be something like sand,'' Dr. Ciarletti said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interior was also homogeneous. There were no big caves or large regions of compressed material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thurid Mannel, a scientist at the University of Graz in Austria, described a menagerie of dust particles spanning a wide range of sizes and materials. Many were shattered by the impact with the device on Rosetta that collected dust particles ejected from the comet. ''The dust is very, very fragile,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists learned much about the comet's landscape. Dr. El-Maarry described its surface as very dark -- reflecting just 3 to 4 percent of the sunlight that hits it. The darkness comes from a dearth of ice at the surface and an abundance of organic molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas are bare rock; others are smooth terrains buried in dust. ''You can think of something like a sea of sand being surrounded by cliffs,'' Dr. El-Maarry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocks are cracked with fissures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anywhere we can see that surface and we have good enough resolution, we see fractures everywhere,'' Dr. El-Maarry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte Goetz of the Technical University Braunschweig was among the scientists who studied the cloud of charged particles around the comet. When Rosetta first arrived, the interplay of particles from the comet with the solar wind produced oscillations in the magnetic fields that the scientists turned into sound, a ''cosmic song.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closer in, as more material spewed off the comet, the tune changed. Dr. Goetz on Thursday presented a longer song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, as Rosetta and the comet moved away from the sun, the original song returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of Thursday's presentations, Matt Taylor, the project scientist, thanked the other scientists who he said had ''worked their guts out to get to where we are today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said they had mixed feelings: sad about Rosetta's demise, and eager to take a deeper look at the reams of data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The operations end,'' Dr. Taylor said, ''but we still have all this science to do, so they're still happy that we got to this stage.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Mr. Musk, the billionaire founder of the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rocket company, has been offering hints and teases of his desire to colonize the big red planet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a talk on Tuesday at the International Astronautical Congress here, Mr. Musk finally provided engineering details, optimistic timelines and a slick video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you saw there is very close to what we'll actually build,'' Mr. Musk said, referring to the rockets and spacecraft in the video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk estimated it would cost $10 billion to develop the rocket, and he said the first passengers to Mars could take off as soon as 2024 if the plans went off without a hitch. For now, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is financing development costs of a few tens of millions of dollars a year, but eventually the company would look to some kind of public-private partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> vehicles would take 100 passengers on the journey to Mars, with trips planned every 26 months, when Earth and Mars pass close to each other. Mr. Musk said the first flights would be ''fairly expensive'' but ticket prices might eventually fall to between $100,000 and $200,000 a person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To establish a self-sustaining Mars civilization of a million people would take 10,000 flights, with many more to ferry equipment and supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to need something quite large to do that,'' Mr. Musk said. It would take 40 years to a century before the city on Mars became self-sufficient, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood at the conference was almost as giddy as a rock concert or the launch of a new Apple product, with people lining up for Mr. Musk's presentation a couple of hours in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk has talked of his ''Mars Colonial Transporter,'' but a couple of weeks ago, he suggested that its capabilities would be much greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name... -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He now calls it the Interplanetary Transport System. The booster would include 42 of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s new, more powerful Raptor engines. On Monday, he posted an image on Twitter of the first testing of a Raptor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> propulsion just achieved first firing of the Raptor interplanetary transport engine pic.twitter.com/vRleyJvBkx -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 26, 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars has long been the goal of Mr. Musk and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Mr. Musk's initial wealth came from his tenure as chief executive of PayPal, which was sold to <span class="companylink">eBay</span> in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Afterward, he wanted to undertake a science experiment -- to send a greenhouse to Mars and see if Earth plants could grow in Martian dirt. He said the rocket options for launching his project were so lacking that he started <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which has headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has established a successful business with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket launching satellites, and by taking cargo -- and soon astronauts -- to the International Space Station for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>. But Mr. Musk has stated often that his loftier goal for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is to send people to Mars to make humanity a ''multiplanetary species'' in order to ensure survival in case some calamity like an asteroid strike befell Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rocket could be used for even more distant trips, to places like Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This system really gives you freedom to go anywhere you want in the greater solar system,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is less clear is how <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will raise the money needed to bring its Mars dreams to fruition. The new rocket is by far the largest ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, a former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> official who is the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Mr. Musk's vision was plausible technically, but added, ''Other than emotional appeal, however, it didn't really address why governments, corporations or other organizations would fund the effort.'' His bottom-line opinion: ''Possible, but not probable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his talk, Mr. Musk put up a slide titled ''Funding.'' The first item was ''Steal underpants,'' a joking reference to a ''South Park'' episode. He also listed <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s businesses -- launching satellites and sending <span class="companylink">NASA</span> cargo and astronauts to the space station -- and ''Kickstarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he admitted that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> would probably not be able to do it alone. ''Ultimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has received much of the financing for its rocket development from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, from contracts to take cargo to and from the International Space Station. The <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> is providing $33.6 million for development of the Raptor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Mr. Musk question whether the Mars dreams are distracting the company from its more mundane business. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 rocket is grounded while investigators try to figure out why one of the rockets on the launchpad exploded this month during fueling before a test firing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the company said the failure appeared to be a large breach in the helium system of the second stage, although what caused the breach is not known. However, the company said the investigation had ruled out any connection to the failure last year of a Falcon 9 that disintegrated in flight. (That failure was traced to a faulty strut in the second stage, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> resumed launching later in the year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk also faces competition from other billionaires with ambitious space dreams. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has his own rocket company, Blue Origin, which this month also announced a new rocket, New Glenn, that approaches the Saturn 5 in stature, but is dwarfed by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s new rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a talk here, Robert Meyerson, Blue Origin's president, said the aim of New Glenn was to take people to space, although it will also be able to launch satellites. The images the company released showed the satellite-carrying version. But Mr. Meyerson disclosed that ''there are other versions that will have a space vehicle on top.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meyerson said Blue Origin had an even larger rocket, to be called New Armstrong, on the drawing board. Mr. Bezos has said his goal is for millions of people to live in space, although he has not mentioned Mars as a destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Mr. Bezos' Amazon wealth, Blue Origin faces less pressure to be profitable as quickly as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, or public companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> that have to answer to shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> is still talking about its Mars ambitions, too, and its own giant rocket, the Space Launch System, for eventual human missions there. William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said all of the pieces for a crewed Mars mission were in development, at least to reach Mars orbit, by the 2030s and fit within the agency's existing budget. ''We don't think we're going to get a big new budget,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He admitted that in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s plans, astronauts' setting foot on Mars would take longer, probably not until the 2040s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk was confident that his company could pull off his vision, but he said he would not be among the first colonists, saying he wants to see his children grow up. The chances of dying on that first trip to Mars, he said, are ''quite high.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 2, 2016, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 28 about Space X's plans to send humans to Mars paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Elon Musk, founder of Space X, about the cost of future flights. He said only that initial prices would be fairly expensive -- not that they would initially cost $500,000. (Mr. Musk said the aim would be for ticket prices to fall to less than $200,000.) The article also referred imprecisely to Mr. Musk's relationship with <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> when it was acquired by <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. While he was still a board member and made money from the sale, he was not <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>'s C.E.O. at the time and he did not sell it to <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. This correction was delayed because editors did not follow through when the errors were pointed out.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For two years, the Rosetta spacecraft has been playing around with a comet shaped like a rubber ducky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the spacecraft makes a gentle belly flop onto the comet on Friday, it will bring to an end to the most ambitious mission ever for the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>. Since its arrival in August 2014 at Comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, Rosetta has been sending reams of data and exquisite photographs of the comet, providing insights and surprises about one of the fragments left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On impact, Rosetta will switch off its radio transmitter, leaving silence at the end of its 12-year journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As soon as we lose contact with the spacecraft, that's the end of Rosetta,'' said Matt Taylor, the mission's project scientist. ''It's a nice appropriate line to be drawn, I think.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in November 2014, Rosetta dispatched a small lander, Philae, to the surface of Comet 67P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as the comet has been moving away from the sun, Rosetta's solar panels were becoming less and less able to generate enough energy to power the spacecraft, and the amount of data the spacecraft could send back has been dropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it was possible to shift Rosetta into a hibernating phase, mission managers calculated that the odds were slim that Rosetta could revive when Comet 67P approached the sun again, about four years from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they decided to undertake some truly close-up observations as Rosetta began falling into the comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Rosetta lands, with no more data coming back, mission controllers will never know the craft's exact fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shutting off the transmitter avoids any possibility of Rosetta's interfering with the deep space communications of other spacecraft. And even if the transmitter were kept on, the antenna would almost certainly be jostled away from Earth by the impact of the landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will not be able to communicate in any case,'' said Patrick Martin, the mission manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then everyone working on the mission will have some time to relax. ''I'm going to put my feet up,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''We have free time, as it were.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still much work to do. Archiving all of the data will take three years, Dr. Martin said. ''Not as intense as missions operations,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists will also finally have time to analyze what they have collected. ''We've only touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of digging through the data,'' said Joel Parker, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and deputy principal investigator for an ultraviolet spectrograph on Rosetta. ''It's been so busy doing operations that a lot of us haven't even had a chance to dig into our own instrument data as much as we would like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is some of what has already come out of Rosetta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets Can Stick Together</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first surprise from the initial images of Comet 67P was that it was not round -- it looked more like a rubber ducky. That immediately raised the question whether the strange shape was the result of erosion or whether it was originally two comets that bumped into each other and stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exposed plateaus on the surface provide an important clue that Comet 67P was originally two comets. ''It's akin to looking at the skin of an onion,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''Looking at the orientation of these layers, it's clear this has to be two objects that have collided.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That in turn has additional implications on how the interior is packed together and how much it could have heated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosetta's cameras have also captured what scientists called ''goose bumps,'' objects about a yard wide that are the building blocks of the comet. ''This is one of the major things that came out of Rosetta, this aspect of how the comet was put together,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''It means comets are much more puzzling that we expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blinded by the Comet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rosetta's early observations, Rosetta scientists were puzzled by the lack of much ice on the comet's surface. After all, comets have long been known as ''dirty ice balls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet 67P is not a particularly bright comet. Even when it reached its closest proximity to the sun, in August last year, it was not visible to the naked eye by people on Earth. But as expected, the comet became much more active. As the comet spun around once every 12 hours, frost formed and disappeared on parts of the comet. Periodically, jets of gas and dust erupted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Taylor said that it appeared that dust on the surface acted as insulation, holding onto the heat during the day that warms ice below, producing gases that rise to the cold surface, freezing again as frost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jets appear to be the consequence of cliff walls crumbling, exposing ice that then quickly vaporized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bursts released so much dust that Rosetta's star trackers, cameras that keep track of the spacecraft's position by looking at the background of stars, were confused. After that, the mission managers moved Rosetta farther away from the comet. ''We had to change the way we ran the mission,'' Dr. Martin said. ''This was my main challenge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parker said that not all dust from Comet 67P was the same. Some particles are fluffy and fragile, and others are more solid pieces. ''These different kinds of dust seem to come from different processes,'' he said. The fluffy dust comes from all over the comet, he said, while the consolidated particles seem to come from specific regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the comet now much quieter, Rosetta has moved closer, within 1.2 miles of the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is going well in this final phase of Rosetta,'' Dr. Martin said. ''The spacecraft hardware is in rather good condition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water Not Like the Oceans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where did the water in Earth's oceans came from? No one knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists now know for sure that it did not come from comets like Comet 67P. Rosetta measured the fraction of deuterium -- a heavy form of hydrogen -- in the stream of water molecules coming off, and it was much higher than that found in Earth's water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current six-and-a-half-year orbit of Comet 67P takes it as far out as Jupiter and even at its closest approach to the sun, it is still outside Earth's orbit. Planetary scientists are sure Comet 67P originated much farther away, beyond Neptune's orbit, in what is known as the Kuiper belt, and was nudged into the inner solar system, probably by a collision or close gravitational interaction with another object.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presence of molecular oxygen, for example, suggests that the comet formed in a very cold region. ''It was fully unexpected,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''We don't expect to get oxygen because it likes to do stuff with other things. It's a very friendly molecule, and it likes to jump and become something else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water finding suggests that Kuiper belt comets are not the source of Earth's water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We Found the Lander!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philae lander, which bounded to the comet's surface in November 2014, was a resounding success and a failure. Mission managers celebrated when the lander touched the surface, but were then puzzled when it appeared to still be rotating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two systems designed to keep Philae pressed to the surface -- harpoons and a thruster -- failed, and the lander bounced high before coming back down. The lander operated for a couple of days before its battery drained. Philae briefly revived a couple of times as the comet neared the sun, then was never heard from again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one was quite sure where Philae ended up until this month, on the very last opportunity, Rosetta finally managed to capture a photograph of Philae on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exact location, scientists will be able to refine the results of an experiment that sent radio transmissions through the comet. ''That will really nail their results,'' Dr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The End</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the final days, Rosetta is being moved into orbits that are more elliptical. One final maneuver will put it on a collision course with Comet 67P, the minuscule gravity pulling the spacecraft for a final embrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing site is on the head portion of the comet, near some intriguing pits. The aim is not to land in one of the pits, just to pass over them, but it is possible that Rosetta will end up in one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Martin said he was ambivalent as Rosetta approached its end. ''I'll be very sad, of course,'' he said. ''We will celebrate the achievement of such an exciting mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parker said the scientists got what they came for. ''We had high hopes, and it went even higher than that,'' he said. ''It's been a wild ride.''</p>

Carl Sagan's Voyager Golden Record -- of sounds of Earth, recorded greetings and an eclectic mix of music that was sent into space -- has long been out of print and pretty much unobtainable for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One copy of the record is attached to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Voyager 1 spacecraft, which has entered interstellar space, the farthest artifact ever tossed out by humanity. A second copy, on Voyager 2, is not quite as distant, just 10 billion miles away.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both are receding from Earth at more than 35,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not even Dr. Sagan, the Cornell astrophysicist who led the creation of the record in 1977 for the listening pleasure of any aliens who happened upon it, could get a copy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He asked. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> said no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, a Kickstarter crowdfunding project begun on Wednesday is planning to reissue it, long a dream of David Pescovitz, an editor and managing partner at Boing Boing, the technology news website, and a research director at the nonprofit Institute for the Future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're 7 years old, and you hear about a group of people creating messages for possible extraterrestrial intelligence,'' Mr. Pescovitz said, ''that sparks the imagination. The idea always stuck with me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He teamed up with Timothy Daly, a manager at Amoeba Music in San Francisco, and Lawrence Azerrad, a graphic designer who has created packaging for Sting, The Beach Boys, Wilco and other musicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reissue will not exactly be like the original, which was pressed out of a gold-plated copper disk. The original was also intended to be played at 16 2/3 revolutions per minute, half of the usual speed of LP records. That was necessary to cram in a variety of sounds of Earth, spoken greetings in 55 languages, 116 images and 90 minutes of music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reissue will consist of three LPs pressed out of vinyl recorded at normal LP speed. The box set will cost $98 plus shipping, with the project aiming to raise $198,000. For the MP3 generation -- or anyone without a phonograph -- digital downloads are available for $25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pescovitz aims to distribute the records next year in time for the 40th anniversary of the Voyager launches. (Voyager 2 launched first, on Aug. 20, 1977; Voyager 1 launched a couple of weeks later, on Sept. 5.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps now the recording, meant to encapsulate thousands of years of music, will finally find an audience. The songs include a Peruvian wedding song, a Pygmy girls' initiation song, a movement from one of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, and ''Johnny B. Goode'' by Chuck Berry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Isn't it funny?'' recalled Timothy Ferris, a science writer who produced the original record. ''It hasn't been heard by any aliens yet, and it hasn't hardly been heard by humans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CD-ROM version was issued in 1992, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has since put digital versions of the greetings and sounds of Earth -- but not the music -- on <span class="companylink">SoundCloud</span>. But this is the first time it will be available as an LP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For us, it's creating a physical, tangible object,'' Mr. Pescovitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferris said the song selections were done by consensus, although Dr. Sagan, who died in 1996, did not like ''Johnny B. Goode'' at first. Alan Lomax, a folk music archivist who was another volunteer member of the committee selecting material for the Voyager records, also disliked the song and complained to Dr. Sagan that it was adolescent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferris recalled Sagan's response: ''Well, there are a lot of adolescents on Earth, too.'' The song went on the record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Ferris added, ''You can't take it too far or you'd be doing Miley Cyrus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen copies of the golden record were made. Afterward, Dr. Sagan wrote to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, asking if he and John Casani, the project manager for Voyager, could obtain copies as mementos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert A. Frosch, the NASA administrator, replied that all of the copies had been distributed to various institutions, mostly <span class="companylink">NASA</span> centers, except for one copy reserved for President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it is not easy to get a glimpse of a copy. The aluminum cover can be seen at the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum</span> in Washington, but the record itself is not on display. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> center that operates the continuing Voyager missions, has its copy of the record on display in a case in an auditorium that is open to the public, at least during public lectures.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Tuesday that it had conducted the ground test of a new long-range rocket engine used to put a satellite into orbit, an effort long considered by Washington and the <span class="companylink">United Nations Security Council</span> to be a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement followed the North's nuclear test on Sept. 9. The United States and its allies are calling for the Security Council to adopt a new resolution to enforce tougher sanctions to punish the North for the latest nuclear test, its fifth since 2006.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, such sanctions have usually prompted the North to respond with provocations, like another nuclear test or a rocket launch to place a satellite into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea last launched a carrier rocket in February, a month after its fourth nuclear test, to place its Kwangmyongsong, or Shining Star, satellite into orbit. (The country also launched a rudimentary satellite in 2012.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have said the North may launch another satellite in time for the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party, using that as a signal to the outside world that it was pushing ahead with its long-range missile program despite sanctions. At home, such a launch is used to boost Kim Jong-un's leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Mr. Kim visited the Sohae Space Center, the North's main satellite launch site near its northwestern border with China, to observe the engine test. He ordered officials there to finish preparations for another satellite launch ''as soon as possible'' to glorify the North Korean people who he said ''have fastened their belts owing to the enemies' harsh sanctions,'' the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news agency did not say when the single-engine test took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The test was aimed to make a final confirmation of the feature of combustion chamber, operation accuracy of valves and control systems and structural reliability of the engine during 200 second-long working time,'' it said, calling the test a success. It said the successful test of the engine will enable the country to launch ''various kinds of satellites including earth observation satellite at a world level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the North's latest nuclear test and a series of ballistic missile tests in recent months, its claim that it has acquired the ability to mount short- and midrange missiles with nuclear warheads has been taken more seriously by United States and South Korean officials. But they said the country was still years from being able to build a nuclear tipped long-range missile, although it habitually threatens to attack the mainland United States with nuclear missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said that the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7,400 miles with a warhead of 1,100 to 1,300 pounds -- far enough to reach the West Coast of the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kim has called for his country to develop and launch ''a variety of more working satellites'' using ''carrier rockets of bigger capacity.'' The country has also renovated and expanded the gantry tower and other facilities at the launch site to accommodate more powerful rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis posted on the website 38 North, Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. and Jack Liu said that the engine test represented an ''anticipated and significant step in the continued development of larger, more advanced space launch vehicles'' by the North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, while announcing sanctions imposed on 11 individuals and entities involved in Iran's ballistic missile program, the United States Treasury included three Iranian officials it said have worked with North Korea on its missile and space programs, including the development of ''an 80-ton rocket booster.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There is a big difference in materials and scale between the visible rings of Saturn and the smattering of Earthborn items that have ended up in orbit, according to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>. Some of the material that humans have sent into space can be visualized as a ring at a specific location, called the geostationary orbit. This is where weather and communications satellites orbit Earth at the same rate as the planet turns on its axis, so they always stay above a single spot on the surface. When these satellites have outlived their usefulness, they will be moved to another orbit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the rest of what is left in space is widely scattered in different orbits. Space scientists keep track of the larger debris so they can maneuver to avoid collisions with useful spacecraft like the International Space Station and Earth-observation satellites. There is not likely to be enough space junk to form visible rings. Material in lower orbits often falls back to Earth after several years, though things in higher orbit may stay there for a century or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States policy aims to minimize the creation of new space debris. Other countries and individual companies also try to control it, by national policy or voluntarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturn's apparently permanent rings are made of ice and rock, often very large chunks. Their exact origins are uncertain. One theory is that the rings resulted from the collision of asteroids and other bodies with the many moons of Saturn. Another is that they are leftover material from the original formation of the planet. question@nytimes.com</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 30, the Rosetta orbiter is scheduled to make its final descent to the comet's surface, which is about the length of Central Park. Just in time, photos taken by the orbiter 2.7 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) away on Friday revealed the main body of the missing lander, which is about the size of a washing machine, and two of its three legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This remarkable discovery comes at the end of a long, painstaking search,'' Patrick Martin, manager of the space agency's Rosetta mission, said in a statement on Monday. ''We were beginning to think that Philae would remain lost forever. It is incredible we have captured this at the final hour.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lander bounced upon impact when a thruster failed to fire, and two harpoons meant to anchor it to the surface did not deploy. Scientists had narrowed its location down to an ''area spanning a few tens of meters,'' but the images available before Friday were in low resolution, and they showed several objects that might have been the lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though its shady, rocky resting spot meant Philae's solar panels could not get enough sunlight, leading to the rapid depletion of its battery, it was able to complete 60 hours of observation before it went into hibernation In that short time, it provided data that cast light on the composition, structure and properties of the comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This wonderful news means that we now have the missing 'ground-truth' information needed to put Philae's three days of science into proper context, now that we know where that ground actually is,'' Matt Taylor, a Rosetta project scientist, said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin, the secretive space company created by Jeffrey P. Bezos, offered a look at its newest rocket design on Monday -- and, by extension, its ambitions to make space travel more frequent and inexpensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the rocket and the ambitions appear to be big.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rockets, named New Glenn after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, are almost as large as the Saturn V rocket that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> used from 1966 to 1973, before rockets started being built smaller. The two-stage version that could venture to low-Earth orbit will be 270 feet tall, and the three-stage version, which could fly outside Earth's orbit, will be 313 feet tall. Both will be 23 feet in diameter, packing seven BE-4 engines, which are developed by Blue Origin, and lifting off with 3.85 million pounds of thrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin plans to first launch the rocket from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, Fla., before the end of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our vision is millions of people living and working in space, and New Glenn is a very important step,'' Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, said in an email update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a private company, Blue Origin could launch wealthy tourists into space, send commercial satellites into orbit and provide the technology to send <span class="companylink">NASA</span> back to the moon, as well as to Mars and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perfecting the technology of reusable rockets -- which the New Glenn rockets would be -- could have profound implications on the cost and frequency of space travel. Imagine how much more expensive a flight from New York to London would be if airlines built a new 747 jet for each flight, throwing them away after one use. That is effectively the current model of the space industry; rockets typically crash back into Earth after exhausting their fuel, and the steep costs of travel depress how often it happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reusability is a total game-changer,'' said Charles Miller, the president of NexGen Space L.L.C., a space and public policy consultancy. ''It's on the order of going from the sail to the steam engine, or going from the horse to the automobile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin first launched its reusable New Shepard rocket from West Texas in November, sending a capsule that would eventually carry paying passengers to a height of 329,839 feet, just crossing the 100-kilometer line that is considered the beginning of outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before New Glenn was announced as the rocket's name on Monday, Mr. Bezos, who owns The <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span>, had referred to it as ''Very Big Brother.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large size of New Glenn -- Mr. Miller, a former senior adviser for NASA, had guessed it would be big but thought it would have five engines, not seven -- suggests the company would seek to lower the price of space tourism by offering more seats on the flights, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Mr. Bezos said that tourists could make short trips into space, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness, as soon as 2018 via the reusable New Shepard spacecraft. The experience would doubtlessly be reserved for the rich, at least initially, but Mr. Bezos said it would be necessary to build expertise and further develop the technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the company was registered in 2000, Mr. Bezos had not let reporters into its headquarters in Kent, Wash., until March of this year. In September 2015, Blue Origin said it would invest $200 million and create 330 jobs by leasing a launch complex at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said if the dream of inexpensive space travel were fulfilled, it would significantly impact life on Earth. In best-case scenarios, the ability to more easily launch satellites could lead to worldwide broadband internet, better weather predictions, the monitoring of carbon sources and the farming of solar energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the United States, it could have national security implications, he said. The ability to destroy United States satellites that provide surveillance and guide missiles is a current liability, but enemies may be less likely to target them if they could be quickly replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And <span class="companylink">NASA</span> will most likely be a customer, using the New Glenn rockets for future missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With this vehicle, going to Mars will become a lot easier,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the subterranean world of the Beatrix gold mine, they shed their backpacks, taking out tools and meticulously prepared test tubes to collect samples.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaning a ladder against the hard rock wall, Tullis C. Onstott, a geosciences professor at Princeton, climbed to open an old valve about a dozen feet up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out flowed water chock-full of microbes, organisms flourishing not from the warmth of the sun, but by heat generated from the interior of the planet below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These tiny life-forms -- bacteria and other microbes and even little worms -- exist in places nearly impossible to reach, living in eternal darkness, in hard rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists like Dr. Onstott have been on the hunt for life in the underworld, not just in South Africa but in mines in South Dakota and at the bottom of oceans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What they learn could provide insights into where life could exist elsewhere in the solar system, including Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microbial Martians might well look like what lives in the rocks here at a deep underground mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same conditions almost certainly exist on Mars. Drill a hole there, drop these organisms in, and they might happily multiply, fueled by chemical reactions in the rocks and drips of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as you can get below the ice, no problems,'' Dr. Onstott said. ''They just need a little bit of water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars has long been a focus of space exploration and science fiction dreams. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has sent more robotic probes there than any other planet. But now there is renewed interest in sending people as well. <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has been enthusiastically promoting its ''Journey to Mars'' goal to send astronauts there in the 2030s. Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, is promising that he will be able to get there a decade sooner and set up colonies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts on Mars would be able to greatly accelerate the quest for answers to the most intriguing questions about the red planet. Was there ever life on Mars? Could there be life there today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not that long ago that scientists had written off Mars as lifeless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years ago, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> spent nearly $1 billion on its Viking mission, which revealed a cold, dry world seemingly devoid of organic molecules that are the building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more recent missions have discovered compelling evidence that Mars was not always such an uninviting place. In its youth, more than three billion years ago, the planet was warmer and wetter, blanketed with a thick atmosphere -- possibly almost Earthlike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fanciful but plausible notion is that life did originate on Mars, then traveled to Earth via meteorites, and we are all descendants of Martians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, Mars did turn cold and dry. Radiation broke apart the water molecules, and the lighter hydrogen atoms escaped to space. The atmosphere thinned to wisps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if life did arise on Mars, might it have migrated to the underworld and persisted?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a couple of decades, Dr. Onstott has been talking his way into South African gold mines, regaling the mine managers with the wonder of deep Earth life to overcome their wariness. In many ways, the mines provide easy access to the depths -- a ride in a cagelike elevator, jammed against miners starting their shift, descending quickly as lights from the different levels zip past. Think of it as traveling through a 450-story skyscraper, going down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Onstott and his colleagues had made repeated pilgrimages to this particular tunnel in this particular mine, Beatrix, 160 miles southwest of Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When miners carve out new tunnels, they poke holes through the rock to see what surprises might lie ahead. Sometimes the borehole taps into a section of fractured rock with water coursing through. Then the fracture is drained and plugged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this particular tunnel at Beatrix never entered production, so the borehole valve remains, allowing the scientists to return to draw samples from the same place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this level, almost a mile underground, the elevator gates open to a well-lit, concrete cavern with the unremarkable plainness of a parking garage. A minirailway system transports miners and ore back and forth. The side tunnel, though, is pitch black save for the helmet lamps, and the trek to the valve is a slosh through muck and over tangles of mangled electrical cabling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists led by Dr. Onstott made their most recent trip to South Africa in June last year. Over a couple of hours, they took their fill of the water and set up an apparatus that remains attached to the valve, trapping microbes, which were retrieved later in the summer. Since then, they have been analyzing the samples to understand this assemblage of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Type of Life</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existence of what biologists now call the Earth's deep biosphere was unknown to almost all biologists at the time of the Viking mission. Life lived at the surface, in the soil or in the oceans. At the bottom of the food chain, the so-called primary producers, were plants and microbes that used photosynthesis and sunlight to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. Other creatures ate the plants and microbes, and then larger creatures ate the smaller ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In someplace that was always dark, it seemed obvious there could be no primary producers and therefore no life at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists noticed close to a century ago this might not always be true. Edson S. Bastin, a geologist at the University of Chicago, wondered why some petroleum was ''sour'' -- with high levels of sulfur that not only corroded pipes but also generated more pollution when burned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bastin realized bacteria could do that, in particular a type of bacteria that does not need oxygen and eats sulfur compounds known as sulfates and excretes hydrogen sulfide -- the rotten egg smell -- and bicarbonate, the unwanted chemicals in sour crude oil. He and a colleague, Frank E. Greer, successfully cultured such bacteria from groundwater from an oil field, and Bastin speculated these could be descendants of bacteria that had been trapped in ocean sediments more than 250 million years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other scientists contended that this must be a mistake, merely surface microbes on the drill that had contaminated the sample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1980s, the Department of Energy started a drilling project, carefully pulling up pristine cores from a couple hundred yards down. Bacteria, fungi and other microbes abounded in the cores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spurred additional research and discoveries, including bacteria that lived in the heat of underground oil deposits and finally, a microbe that degraded oil as Bastin had predicted. Today, the deep biosphere is thought to account for 10 to 20 percent of mass of all life on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life, biologists also discovered, perseveres in other environments once thought sterile -- highly acidic water, highly alkaline water, highly salty water, boiling water around volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The truth is it's virtually everywhere we look,'' Penny Boston, the director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, said in July at a panel celebrating the 40th anniversary of Viking's landing on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Methane Mystery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results from an earlier trip to Beatrix befuddled Dr. Onstott. He had expected the mine microbes to be feeding off organic matter dissolved in the water. In this picture, the ecosystem would be largely devoid of primary producers and instead subsist on leftovers, the detritus of long dead organisms washed down from above or deposited with the sediment 2.9 billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only problem was that we didn't have any indication they were eating the organic matter in the fracture water,'' Dr. Onstott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They figured out that the carbon molecules in the microbes came from methane, a plausible answer. Microbes known as methanogens consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide and produce methane; other microbes known as methanotrophs eat methane. But the Beatrix water contained little of either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It didn't make any sense at all,'' Dr. Onstott said. ''It made zero sense to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maggie Lau, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Onstott's laboratory, started examining the genetic snippets for clues of how the Beatrix community of microbes worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the newest data, it turned out there was a wider community of primary producer microbes, eating nitrogen and sulfur compounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In essence, the waste of one microbe helped feed its neighbor, and only a little bit of methane, an energy-rich molecule, was enough to power the entire community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, for the first time, we're getting a true description of the ecosystem,'' Dr. Onstott said. ''We think it's a fairly common phenomenon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After working at Beatrix, the scientists went north, to the Limpopo region close to South Africa's border with Zimbabwe. There, they collected water from hot springs, whose source of water from far below should carry up underground microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sampling site was in the middle of a small village where houses do not have plumbing and the spring, the hottest in South Africa, is a pond that serves as a communal spot for cleaning laundry. Another is a pool at a resort, once catering to the country's white minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprisingly, the spring waters contained almost no microbes -- barely enough DNA to analyze. But water from two locations contained considerable amounts of methane, an encouraging sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The methane is also a possible connection to Mars. A dozen years ago, three teams of scientists, one using data from the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Mars Express orbiter, the other two using observations from Earth, made the controversial claim of methane floating in the Martian atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a surprise, because sunlight and chemical reactions destroy methane; any methane there would have had to have been released recently. There are two ways to produce methane. One is a geological process that requires heat and liquid water. The other is methanogens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perplexingly, the readings of methane later vanished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Curiosity rover drove across Gale Crater a couple of years ago, it too detected a burp of methane that lasted a couple of months. But it has not detected any burps since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps an underground population of methanogens and methanotrophs is creating, then destroying methane quickly, accounting for its sudden appearance and disappearance from the atmosphere. If Beatrix is a guide, the methane could be providing the energy for many other microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conventional wisdom is that Martian life, if it exists, would be limited to microbes. But that too is a guess. In the South African mine, the researchers also discovered a species of tiny worms eating the bacteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like Moby Dick in Lake Ontario,'' Dr. Onstott said. ''It was a big surprise to find something that big in a tiny fracture of a rock. The fact it would be down there in such a confined space slithering around is pretty amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Uncertain Quest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odds of Mars life, past or present, are just conjecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if life did arise on Mars four billion years ago and later migrated underground, could it have survived for four billion years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons to be skeptical. When low on water and energy, microbes can slow their metabolism or enter a state of suspended animation, able to revive when conditions improve. But many biologists doubt that such a tenuous hold on life could extend for a few billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars also lacks Earth's plate tectonics, a continual recycling of the outer crust of the planets that fractures rocks and exposes new minerals for microbes to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If life is deep underground, robotic spacecraft would not find them easily. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s InSight spacecraft, scheduled to launch in 2018, will carry an instrument that can burrow 16 feet into the ground, but it is essentially just a thermometer to measure the flow of heat to the surface. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s next rover, launching in 2020, is largely a clone of Curiosity with different experiments. It will drill rock samples to be returned to Earth by a later mission, but those samples will be from rocks at the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this new interest in possible life on Mars is a sort of vindication for Gilbert V. Levin, one of the scientists who worked on Viking. Dr. Levin is sure he discovered life on Mars 40 years ago, and everyone else has been drawing the wrong conclusions from the Viking data. If he is right, then perhaps rediscovering life on Mars may require just scratching the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two Vikings carried what was known as the labeled release experiment, developed by Dr. Levin and another investigator, Patricia A. Straat. Essentially, radioactive food made with unstable carbon-14 was added to samples of Martian soil. The idea was that if microbes digested the food, the carbon-14 would be released in a stream of radioactive carbon dioxide and other gases rising out of the soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then other samples were heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit to sterilize them. If microbes were generating the radioactive gases, then there should be no gas rising from the sterilized soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, too, is what happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The response on Mars is well within the responses from terrestrial soils,'' Dr. Levin said, ''most closely the Arctic and Alaska.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the absence of organic molecules, other Viking scientists discounted the possibility of life. It was like claiming the existence of a city in a place lacking wood, steel, bricks or any other building materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levin has proposed, again and again, sending another labeled release experiment to Mars, to no avail. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s 2020 rover will be able to catalog a wide variety of organic molecules, but carries nothing to look for life directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levin may finally get his wish with ExoMars, a European rover scheduled to launch in 2020. He is working with one of the teams building one of ExoMars's instruments to see if it could be modified to incorporate the labeled release apparatus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a bit of a race against time. Dr. Levin, the last surviving member of the Viking biology team, is 92. ''All I have to do is last that long,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next two years, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s latest robotic spacecraft will be chasing down an asteroid near Earth in the hopes of scooping up some of the most primordial bits of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise of the mission for the spacecraft, Osiris-Rex, is simple: Fly to an asteroid, grab some of the rock and bring it back to Earth, where scientists will study some of the pristine ingredients that went into the making of the solar system, including possibly the building blocks of life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What was that beginning organic material like?'' James L. Green, the director of NASA's planetary science division, said in an interview. ''That's what's really exciting about this. This is what we want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details are a bit more complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft is sitting on top of an Atlas 5 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Fla., ready for launching on Thursday on a seven-year mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once off the ground, Osiris-Rex -- a shortening of Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer -- will be aiming to get close to the asteroid Bennu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's 500 meters or so in size, about the height of the Empire State Building,'' Dr. Green said. Discovered in 1999, Bennu is a carbon-rich, almost black asteroid. Data from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Spitzer Space Telescope and radar measurements by ground-based radio telescopes suggest it is a ''rubble pile'' with pebbles about half an inch wide on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists believe that it is a conglomeration of leftovers, largely unchanged over the last 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation,'' said Dante Lauretta, a professor of planetary science and cosmochemistry at the University of Arizona who is the mission's principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osiris-Rex will survey Bennu for more than a year to select the site where it will grab the sample of rock. In July 2020, the spacecraft, about the size of an sport utility vehicle, is to slowly descend and bounce off the surface like a pogo stick at a gentle pace of a quarter-mile per hour. A sampling head, which looks like an automobile air filter, will shoot a burst of nitrogen to kick up dirt and small rocks during the three to five seconds it is in contact with the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to collect at least a couple of ounces of material and possibly as much as 4.4 pounds. The spacecraft carries enough nitrogen to attempt to extract material three times if necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After departing Bennu in 2021, Osiris-Rex will pass by Earth in September 2023, dropping off a capsule with the samples that will land via parachute in a Utah desert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Japanese mission, Hayabusa 2, will similarly collect samples from another carbon-rich asteroid, but the Osiris-Rex scientists view the missions as complementary, not redundant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lauretta said he was particularly interested in gleaning information about organic molecules like amino acids, the building blocks of proteins that are known to float in outer space. One question is whether Bennu contains higher concentrations of the 20 amino acids used by forms of life on Earth compared with dozens of others not found in living organisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life on Earth also exclusively uses so-called ''left-handed'' amino acids and not the mirror, right-handed versions. Study of the Bennu material could help explain whether nonbiological chemical reactions in space pushed life toward left-handed molecules or whether that shift occurred later when life arose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists also hope that waterlogged minerals in the sample could tell whether the water in Earth's oceans came from asteroids like Bennu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its shape, like a top, fatter around the Equator as it spins around in 4.3 hours, also suggests that the stuff of Bennu is not solid rock but shifts and slides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studying this asteroid could also come in handy if it is ever on a collision course with Earth. With about a 14-month orbit, Bennu passes fairly close once every six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2035, it will make a particularly close approach, passing within the orbit of the moon, and Earth will give enough of a gravitational kick that astronomers cannot precisely predict where the asteroid will go after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a small chance -- one in 2,700 -- that Bennu will smack into Earth sometime from 2175 to 2196.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bennu is not large enough to wreak planetwide extinctions -- the asteroid that is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was about six miles wide -- but a collision would be devastating. Impact would occur at more than 27,000 miles per hour, unleashing energy equivalent to 1,450 million tons of TNT and carving a crater almost three miles wide and 1,500 feet deep, Dr. Lauretta calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the uncertainties in predicting Bennu's path is that gravity is not the only force acting on it. As the asteroid rotates, the dark surface absorbs sunlight and then radiates heat. The radiated heat pushes the asteroid like a rocket thruster, a small effect that becomes significant over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With detailed observations of the surface, scientists will be able to test their models of this effect with the actual orbits of Bennu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Lauretta, Osiris-Rex's launching is a culmination of a dozen years of work. In 2004, officials at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> discussed the idea of an asteroid return mission with Michael J. Drake, the head of the Lunar and Planetary Institute at Arizona. Dr. Drake invited Dr. Lauretta to take part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lauretta came up with the name. ''That's entirely my fault,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he jotted some themes of the scientific objectives -- origins, spectroscopy, resources and security -- he had most of the letters of Osiris, the Egyptian god who was the lord of the underworld but who also represented the seeds of regeneration to new life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the dual nature of the Osiris myth,'' Dr. Lauretta said. ''I had to buy a couple of vowels.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, engineers at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> had to figure out how to grab a bit of asteroid. The company held a contest. Many of the proposals suggested landing and scooping, but an engineer named James Harris came up with the pogo stick idea, testing out a prototype in his dirt driveway with a plastic cup and an air compressor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now instead of worrying about how to anchor a spacecraft to an asteroid,'' said Richard Kuhns, the program manager for Osiris-Rex at Lockheed Martin Space Systems, ''in almost no gravity, you get to gently touch it, take your sample and then back away. Much, much safer for a spacecraft in that environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Bennu's surface, the pull of gravity may be somewhere from one-hundred-thousandth to one-millionth as that of Earth's, depending on the location. That means the spacecraft, about 3,000 pounds while awaiting launch, will probably weigh less than an ounce as it nudges Bennu to collect the rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the team added instruments to make detailed measurements of Bennu before grabbing the sample, Dr. Lauretta tacked Rex (Regolith Explorer) on to the name, because of the connotation with Tyrannosaurus rex and dinosaurs. ''We wanted that connection,'' Dr. Lauretta said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> selected Osiris-Rex in May 2011, four months before Dr. Drake died after receiving a diagnosis of liver cancer and a liver transplant. Dr. Lauretta was promoted to Dr. Drake's position on the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Dr. Lauretta is looking forward to three moments of Osiris-Rex's journey. The first is when the spacecraft takes its first clear photograph of Bennu. ''That is the moment of truth, what we are up against,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second is when the Osiris-Rex grabs the bits of Bennu, and the third is when the sample arrives back on Earth, seven years from now.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's probably just a piece of cosmic spam, the astrophysical equivalent of butt dialing. But nobody really knows for sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attention of the world's astronomers has been riveted these last few days on a star in the constellation Hercules, wondering if the end of humanity's cosmic loneliness was finally at hand.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was from that spot in Hercules that a team of Russian radio astronomers recorded a two-second burst of radio waves last year on May 15. But the Russians did not follow the usual protocol of alerting other observatories that could confirm the signal, and as a result nobody else knew about the pulse until a few days ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That putative signal had the potential to be the fantasied ''Hi there,'' from another world that practitioners of the field known as SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, have been looking for over the last century. Or it could simply be a false alarm from terrestrial interference, a stray military transmission or some rare astrophysical misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers already knew there was at least one planet, about 17 times the mass of Earth, circling that star, which is 94 light years from here and goes by the unheroic designation of HD164595.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were also problems, the Russians, led by Alexander Panov of <span class="companylink">Lomonosov Moscow State University</span>, realized. The signal appeared only once in 39 observations, and to produce the observed signal at such a distance would take a transmitter with the power of at least a trillion watts, comparable to the total energy consumption of all humankind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the design of the Russian telescope, known as Ratan-600, a giant circle of antennas in the Caucasus near Georgia, leaves it susceptible, astronomers say, to radiation from unwanted directions, increasing the chances of interference from military or other terrestrial sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word finally got out a few days ago. Claudio Maccone, a member of the team and chairman of the SETI committee of the International Academy of Astronautics, circulated a description of the observations in advance of a SETI meeting to be held on Sept. 27 in Guadalajara, Mexico. While the report did not claim that this was an alien detection, it did say, ''Permanent monitoring of this target is needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email on Aug. 29, Dr. Maccone said he agreed. ''I certainly share the view that it is likely not an intelligent signal,'' he said. ''Nevertheless it had to be PUBLISHED, rather than being kept secret for over a year, and this is what I did: convince the Russians to publish it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the astronomy writer Paul Gilster reported it on his blog Centauri Dreams, the signal went supernova on the internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far the results have been zilch. Starting on the evening of Aug. 28, astronomers from the SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif., swung into action with the Allen Telescope Array, a set of antennas in Hat Creek, Calif., built specifically to look for alien broadcasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two nights of observing, Seth Shostak, spokesman for the institute reported, ''We covered the frequencies observed by the Russians and more ... No dice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile astronomers from Breakthrough Listen, a new SETI project funded by the Russian philanthropist and entrepreneur Yuri Milner, used the Green Bank Telescope, in Green Bank, W.Va., the world's largest steerable radio dish, to check out the star. They found nothing but noise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, according to Tass, the Russian news agency, the researchers had also concluded that their signal was a result of terrestrial interference. The observatory, the researcher Yulia Sotnikova said, was preparing an official disclaimer of any media claims of extraterrestrial contact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody plans to keep looking, but for now the Hercules signal seems destined to join the other false alarms that have characterized the SETI endeavor, most notably the ''wow'' signal that appeared on the printout of an Ohio State radio telescope in 1977 but never reappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Maccone said: ''There were similar cases in the past, and probably there will be more in the future. The point is to PUBLISH everything and EXCHANGE DATA worldwide about the stars where they come from.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have been trying to tune in E.T. ever since Frank Drake, now at the University of California, Santa Cruz, aimed an antenna in 1960 at a pair of stars and thought he heard a signal -- the first false alarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing has been able to discourage astronomers from a notion that is as powerful and simple as a poem: Radio signals can bridge the gulfs between stars more cheaply than spacecraft, allowing distant species to communicate by a sort of cosmic ham radio or galactic internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way and some nine billion radio channels on which to listen -- a ''cosmic haystack'' in the vernacular, of which only a minuscule fraction has been sampled to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a lively and rich literature on what channels aliens might use and what kind of signals they might send, and an equally rich literature on why we haven't seen any evidence of them (outside of the racks in supermarkets).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the possible answers is that we are under quarantine, or that technological species kill themselves off before they get to the stage of reaching out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or perhaps that we simply don't have any idea what we are looking for. We know of only one example of life and intelligence in the universe, Jill Tarter of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> once told me. That is of course our own biosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this field,'' she said, ''number two is the all-important number. We count one, two, infinity. We're all looking for number two.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explosion of a <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rocket last Thursday will have an impact across the space industry, far beyond the losses on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Israeli satellite operator's deal to sell itself to a Chinese company is imperiled. Planned launches of communications satellites that support international mobile phone service and digital television are delayed and put in doubt. <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station will probably be disrupted.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of them are customers of the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, whose rocket exploded in Florida. The private space launch company, led by the entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a generally solid safety record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last week's setback and a failed launch last year, when its rocket carrying a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> cargo fell apart in flight, are raising questions about <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a company that has risen rapidly by offering lower costs and promising accelerated launch schedules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this stage, there are more questions than answers. The key for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will be how quickly it can satisfy federal investigators, rebuild the damaged launchpad at Cape Canaveral and resume sending satellites into space. For commercial telecommunications customers, getting a satellite manufactured is time-consuming and expensive, taking two years or more and costing $200 million to $400 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch itself is a high-risk step, but once in orbit the satellites are money spinners. The upfront investment is paid back in a few years, and they then generate hefty profits for the remainder of their useful life, which could be as much as a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So once a satellite is ready to go, time on the ground -- and delay -- are financially painful. Among the commercial satellite operators lined up for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launches later this year are <span class="companylink">Iridium Communications</span>, SES of Luxembourg, <span class="companylink">EchoStar</span> and <span class="companylink">KT Corporation</span> of South Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No doubt <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will fix the problems, but if you're a customer time is money,'' said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA administrator. ''This will get customers looking at alternatives. It may give competitors an opening and slow down <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large communications customers have the most money at stake in space. Revenue for satellite services last year was $127.4 billion, according to a report by the Tauri Group, a research firm, for the <span class="companylink">Satellite Industry Association</span>. The launch business, though the gateway to space, is small by comparison -- $5.4 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the market for launching large, geostationary communications satellites, the main <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> rival is <span class="companylink">Arianespace</span>, a French multinational company. And there are others, notably International Launch Services, an American-Russian joint venture, which launches Russian-designed Proton rockets from Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Arianespace</span>, which has an excellent safety record, is considerably more expensive than <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. And the safety and performance record of the Proton rockets lags behind that of the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> workhorse, the Falcon 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launch timetable is delayed by a few months, industry analysts say, its customers will probably wait. If the delays stretch out further, other launch providers will look increasingly appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovering from delays to its aggressive launch schedule -- while losing momentum -- is the challenge for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, not a financial squeeze. In a statement on Friday, the company said its business was ''robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it was too early to predict when its launches might resume. In addition to the damaged launchpad, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has two others under construction. One is in Florida, which the company says should be ready in November. The other is at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said was in ''the final stages of an operational upgrade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A longer-term issue for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is whether the rocket explosion and its aftermath raise concerns about its plans to move into the field of manned spaceflights for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and for launching military and national security satellites for the Department of Defense. Its competitor for that business is the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list price for the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> Falcon 9 is $62 million while the larger, more powerful Falcon Heavy is $90 million. There are further costs beyond the rocket itself, but analysts say <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> launches cost at least 50 percent less than what its main competitors charge. It has achieved that efficiency by streamlining production techniques, designing a stripped-down launchpad and stepping up the pace of launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each innovation adds risk, said Phil Smith, an analyst for the Tauri Group. But <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, he added, has been approved by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> for cargo missions and certified by the Air Force, both of which have high safety and performance standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explosion investigation and launchpad repair seem sure to scuttle <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s aggressive launch plans this year. The company had hoped for as many as 18 rocket launches this year. It has had eight so far; last week's would have made nine. Over all, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Florida accident is also rippling through the insurance market. Insuring the risk of getting a satellite into space comes in two stages. The preflight insurance is intended to mainly cover the risk of damage to the rocket and satellite on their way to the launchpad. Premiums are a fraction of a percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launch policies, which take effect when the rocket is fired up, are costly, ranging from 5 to 15 percent historically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Falcon 9 exploded during a prelaunch test. So launch policies did not kick in. And the insurance payout will fall on the roughly two dozen preflight insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Parker, managing director of Assure Space, an underwriting agency, is waiting to see the cause of the explosion. If it is a design or manufacturing flaw or an operational error, launch rates for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> flights may well go up. His firm had underwritten a launch policy on last week's flight at 6 percent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One business casualty of the explosion is the $285 million sale of Space Communications, an Israeli satellite operator, to a unit of a Chinese company, Xinwei Technology Group. That deal hinged on the launch of <span class="companylink">Spacecom</span>'s Amos-6 satellite, an Israeli design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite was insured, but because of the explosion, <span class="companylink">Spacecom</span>'s five-year contract with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Eutelsat Communications of France to supply internet access to people in sub-Saharan Africa was canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Spacecom</span>'s stock price fell 9 percent on Thursday, and another 34 percent on Sunday. In a news conference on Sunday, <span class="companylink">Spacecom</span> executives said they were trying to renegotiate the deal with Xinwei and exploring other options.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blast is likely to disrupt <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency's growing reliance on private companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to carry materials and, soon, astronauts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first problem Mr. Musk has suffered as he tries to create space travel that is cheap and commonplace. Each of his companies, including Tesla and <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>, has hit major stumbling blocks recently. The owner of a Tesla car died in May in a crash using the company's autopilot software, and <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> faces major financial challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is running a punishing schedule,'' said Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is probably some human factor involved here. To what extent was human error part of this? And if so, why? Are you running your people too hard? What are your safety requirements?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pace, said an internal investigation would have to look at the company's operations as it tried to ramp up the pace of launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement, ''Our No. 1 priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, and we will carefully investigate and address this issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames in a violent series of blasts starting at 9:07 a.m., spewing plumes of dark smoke around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and sending vibrations felt by residents nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket had been set to launch on Saturday, carrying a satellite for <span class="companylink">Spacecom</span>, an Israeli company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just hours after the news of the explosion broke, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed disappointment on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page ''that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s launch failure destroyed our satellite,'' a swipe at Mr. Musk and his team, who were still trying to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk did not respond publicly to Mr. Zuckerberg. But he posted a brief explanation on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>: ''Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Falcon 9, developed by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> with <span class="companylink">NASA</span> financing, has had previous problems. In June 2015, a rocket carrying <span class="companylink">NASA</span> cargo to the International Space Station fell apart in-flight when a strut holding a helium bottle snapped, setting off a chain of events that destroyed the rocket moments later. This latest episode is likely to push back the timetable <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had after hiring <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> to carry astronauts to the space station by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> said it was too soon to say how the explosion would affect its space station operations, asserting that it remained ''confident'' in its commercial partners. ''Today's incident -- while it was not a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> launch -- is a reminder that spaceflight is an incredible challenge, but our partners learn from each success and setback,'' the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s next cargo mission to the space station is scheduled for November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coincidentally on Thursday, a report released by NASA's inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> were likely to face additional delays in their launch schedules anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launches with crews will probably not lift off before the second half of 2018, three years later than planned, the inspector general said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is making to the design of the capsule, to allow landing in water instead of on land, are causing the latest delays, Mr. Martin said. In addition, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has been slow in examining safety reviews submitted by the companies, and as a result, late and costly redesigns might be needed, Mr. Martin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> lists about 40 launches of satellites and other cargo on its manifest for commercial companies, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and the Air Force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space industry experts say that Mr. Musk faces risks in balancing <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s backlog of contracts -- spanning the next few years -- without cutting corners to stay on the company's busy schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whenever you have a failure along these lines, you of course face delays, which inevitably sets back some of your commercial and government satellite contracts,'' said Marco Cáceres, senior space analyst and director of space studies at The <span class="companylink">Teal Group</span>, an aerospace research firm. ''They have to fight the temptation to keep to a schedule, even if that means setting back their launches into next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had hoped for 18 rocket launches this year; so far, eight have occurred. Over all, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An episode like Thursday's is rare. Jonathan McDowell of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> in Cambridge, Mass., who tracks rocket history, said the last time such an explosion happened on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, before the ignition of engines for liftoff, was in 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is rebuilding a separate launchpad, one of the two formerly used for <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s space shuttle missions, for the astronaut launches. That launchpad is scheduled to be ready by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business analysts were mixed on the effects of the explosion on Mr. Musk's other investments at a time when he is under considerable financial pressure with the planned merger of Tesla and <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk draws vocal admirers and detractors, some of whom are ''short'' investors betting that Tesla cannot execute on its business plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trip Chowdry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research who studies Tesla's performance, described Mr. Musk's situation as a ''double-edged sword.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When things work out well, people believe Musk to be a superstar,'' Mr. Chowdry said. But when things go wrong like an explosion at a separate company, Tesla investors tend to make more general inferences, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When all is said and done, does it have any impact on Tesla stock? No,'' he said. ''But events at <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> do create headline risk for Tesla stockholders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demise of the satellite, called Amos-6, puts a significant damper on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s Internet.org initiative, a grand plan spearheaded by Mr. Zuckerberg to provide wireless connectivity to nations across the world that do not otherwise have easy internet access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a partnership with Eutelsat, a French satellite provider, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> planned to use Amos-6 to offer internet coverage to large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Along with satellite coverage, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is teaming with local internet providers to offer access, and is also building its own drones -- the first of which is named Aquila -- to beam internet connectivity down to cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its Internet.org initiative had already sustained a setback when the company's aggressive overtures were rejected by local regulators in India earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg struck an upbeat tone in his post about the rocket failure, noting that the company has other strategies in the works to expand internet connectivity across the world.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prepare for the Perseids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the annual meteor shower will illuminate the night sky with cosmic fireworks, creating a particularly dazzling display for skygazers across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span> estimates that between 160 and 200 meteors will ignite in Earth's atmosphere every hour during the display's peak on Thursday night and Friday morning. Normally the shower has between 80 and 100 space specks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can thank Jupiter and its intense gravity for turning this year's meteor shower into a meteor hurricane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Perseids occur when Earth runs into pieces of debris floating in the solar system that were left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle. The 17-mile-wide dirty snowball orbits the sun about once every 133 years. It made its last close pass by the sun in 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you won't be seeing the leftovers of that event. A general rule of thumb with meteor showers is that you are never watching remnants from a comet's most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous pass. In this case, the debris were ejected when Comet Swift-Tuttle visited in 1862 or earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this week's shower, Jupiter's gravity has tugged together at least three meteor streams left by the comet into Earth's path. Our planet will run into a cluster of leftovers from Comet Swift-Tuttle's rendezvous in 1862, 1479 and 1079.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're seeing pieces of ice that have been orbiting for that long kamikaze-ing themselves into the Earth's atmosphere,'' said Bill Cooke, an astronomer with <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Meteoroid Environment Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter's large gravitational pull is constantly influencing the meteor streams, according to Dr. Cooke. Sometimes it tugs them toward Earth, and sometimes it pushes them farther away. The last time a special Perseids shower like this one occurred was in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Perseids zoom through the atmosphere at around 133,000 miles per hour and burst about 60 miles overhead, according to Dr. Cooke. Most of the meteors are about the size of a grain of sand, but some can be as large as a silver dollar. You should be able to see many of the small bursts, but it's the handful of large ones that create jaw-dropping fireballs when set ablaze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It scares you to the bone when you see it coming across,'' said Jackie Faherty, an astronomer from the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>. ''If you get just one, it will be embedded in your vision for all time. I don't think you forget things like this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to see the Perseids meteor shower, according to Dr. Faherty, is to go to a location with a clear view of the entire night sky. Ideally you would go somewhere with dark skies, but she said the main thing to look for is a spot that offers a wide, unobstructed view. She said that even in a crowded city like New York you could still spot some of the flashes by going to a rooftop. The best time to watch is before dawn on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before getting their hopes up, stargazers should be warned that the weather and moonlight can obscure the show. If that happens, there are several livestreams of the event to watch, like one hosted by <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and one hosted by Slooh, a global system of cameras and telescopes pointed at the sky. Still, Dr. Faherty suggests people get outside and try to see it for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is worth waiting out there for an hour, two hours, three hours, four hours even to catch a glimpse of something like this,'' she said. ''When you get a good one, it will rival the stars in the sky.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moon Express</span>, based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., announced Wednesday that it had received approval from the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span> to set a robotic lander on the moon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That feat would win the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize competition for the first private organization to reach the moon and an accompanying $20 million reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than the prize, company officials say that it will be the opening of a profitable frontier for entrepreneurs. ''Rephrasing John F. Kennedy, we choose to go to the moon not because it's easy, but because it's a good business,'' said Naveen Jain, the Moon Express chairman. ''Everything we fight over -- whether it's land or it's fresh water, whether it is energy -- is in abundance in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moon Express</span> has a ways to go before it can reach the lunar surface, which it hopes to do next year. It still has to assemble the lander. The rocket that it plans to launch on has yet to fly even once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one of its competitors could beat it to the moon, and the $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approval reflects an effort to encourage 21st-century commercial space endeavors while staying within an international space treaty written 49 years ago when outer space was a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a start-up going to the moon an unlikely fantasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of things in the treaties we're testing the limits of right now,'' said Henry R. Hertzfeld, a professor of space policy and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington. ''We're trying to define them in ways that will encourage private investment and private opportunities but not violate any international agreements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, commercial ventures have gone as far out as geosynchronous orbit, the telecommunication satellites that fly 22,236 miles above the Earth. <span class="companylink">Moon Express</span> wants to go 10 times as far, to the moon, a place where just three nations have landed: the United States, the Soviet Union and, more recently, China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X Prizes, started by Peter H. Diamandis, an entrepreneur, seek to recreate the barnstorming prizes of the early 20th century that spurred aviation advances like Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic. The first X Prize, for the first private piloted vehicle to reach space, led to the development of SpaceShipOne, a rocket-powered plane that made two flights in two weeks in 2004 to win the $10 million prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bubbly optimism that followed, the X Prize Foundation enlisted <span class="companylink">Google</span> to finance reaching the loftier target of the moon. The <span class="companylink">Google</span> Lunar X Prize, announced in 2007, called for putting a spacecraft on the moon that would be able to send back video and images and also move more than 500 meters. The first team to achieve that would claim $20 million; second place would be rewarded with $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 30 teams signed up, including <span class="companylink">Moon Express</span>, founded in 2010 by Mr. Jain, who made a fortune creating the website <span class="companylink">InfoSpace</span> and then lost most of it in the internet bust of 2000; Robert D. Richards, a space entrepreneur; and Barney Pell, a former NASA computer scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original deadline, at the end of 2012, was extended several times; now the remaining 16 teams have until Dec. 31, 2017, to claim the prize. Two teams, Moon Express and SpaceIL, an Israeli nonprofit, have secured launch contracts for their spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">Moon Express</span> worked on its MX-1 lander, company officials realized that they had other hurdles: paperwork and international treaties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Outer Space Treaty prohibits nations from claiming sovereignty over the moon or other parts of the solar system. It also states: ''The activities of nongovernmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate state party to the treaty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States fought to include that clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments, said Matthew Schaefer, the director of the space, cyber and telecommunications law program at the University of Nebraska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the American negotiators did not necessarily foresee a company like <span class="companylink">Moon Express</span>, ''the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> wanted to keep that option open,'' Professor Schaefer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, that would have been a roadblock, said Dr. Richards, Moon Express's chief executive, because the United States did not have any procedures for authorizing and supervising what companies like <span class="companylink">Moon Express</span> want to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any application to the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> would have been vetoed by the State Department, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks that would allow the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> to remain in compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the process for approval was routed through the F.A.A., which regulates commercial rocket launches and payloads headed to space. In 2013, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, a company that builds inflatable structures that could one day be used as lunar habitats, suggested that the F.A.A. use this process to coordinate competing commercial efforts, at least among American companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moon Express</span> has now employed this payload review process for its lunar trip. The F.A.A. sent its approval on July 20, the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jain said that low-cost missions to the moon -- under $10 million -- would transform space exploration. But the company has revealed little about its customers and much of the hoped-for business like the mining of platinum and helium-3 is speculative. (The helium-3 would be for fusion power plants that do not yet exist.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, there is little worry that the moonscape is about to be scarred by a commercial onslaught. The MX-1 is about the size of a coffee table, and <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has left far more litter on the moon, most recently crashing its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer into the far side of the moon in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of more concern is the preservation of earlier artifacts like the Apollo landing sites, especially as the Lunar X Prize offers a $4 million bonus for broadcasting video from one of those sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moon Express</span> said that it had not yet decided on a landing site, but that it would defer to <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s wishes and stay away from the Apollo sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jain said the greatest opportunities were the ones not yet imagined, just as Apple, when it created the iPhone, did not foresee the explosion of apps that would run on the device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More importantly,'' Mr. Jain said, ''we don't know what the Pokémon Go of the moon is going to be.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 24 people have ever gone to deep space, or to the area beyond the Earth's magnetic shield. These are the Apollo astronauts who flew to the moon, the last of whom did so in 1972.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, dreams of deep space exploration are surfacing again. Government space programs and private corporations alike have their eyes set on returning to the moon for longer visits and venturing beyond, to Mars, in the coming decades.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Delp, a professor of human sciences at Florida State University, said researchers need to better understand and study the effects of deep space travel on the human body. ''There are an incredible number of unanswered questions,'' he said. ''One of these is what deep space does to the cardiovascular system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published on Thursday, a week after the 47th anniversary of the first moon landing, Dr. Delp and a NASA-affiliated team of researchers examined how deep space travel may have affected the cardiovascular health of Apollo astronauts. Comparing Apollo astronauts who have died with other astronauts who either never flew in orbital missions or only flew in low Earth orbit, Dr. Delp and his colleagues found a higher rate of cardiovascular deaths among Apollo astronauts. Based on further research in mice, they suggest that the cause of cardiovascular disease in these astronauts may have been deep space radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is the first to look specifically at the long-term health of Apollo lunar astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers in the field agree that the question of how deep space affects cardiovascular health is an important one. ''Data from animal and cell biology experiments have suggested that there may be cause for concern,'' said Dennis Kucik, a professor of pathology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who studies radiation-induced cardiovascular disease for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> but was not involved in this study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, experts also have concerns about the scientific legitimacy of studying an extremely small number of astronauts. At the time of this study, only seven of the 24 Apollo lunar astronauts have died. Of those seven, three died of cardiovascular disease (Neil Armstrong, who flew on Apollo 11; James Irwin, who flew on Apollo 15 and Ronald Evans, who flew on Apollo 17).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with a small sample size is that a one-person difference can drastically alter the statistics, said Jay Buckey, a professor of medicine and engineering at <span class="companylink">Dartmouth College</span> who did not participate in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, at least one of the three Apollo astronauts who died of cardiovascular disease, Mr. Irwin, may have had cardiovascular problems before he left Earth. During his flight on Apollo 15, Mr. Irwin experienced a bout of heart arrhythmia, which was later noted in a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> report as being possibly related to ''pre-existing, undetected coronary artery disease.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unexplored risk factors could also explain why the other two Apollo astronauts died of cardiovascular disease, Dr. Buckey said. ''Were they smokers? Did they have a family history of heart disease? Did they have high cholesterol? Those are all factors that could lead to heart disease, without having to bring galactic cosmic radiation into the mix,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because this study relied on a small number of astronauts and did not consider such risk factors, ''it is not possible to determine whether cosmic ray radiation affected the Apollo astronauts,'' Tabatha Thompson, a representative for NASA, wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The epidemiology of Apollo astronauts is the novel portion of this study, but it is not the only one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research on mice supports previous studies that have shown similar results, said Benjamin Levine, director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Resources and a professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who was not involved in the research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their study, Dr. Delp and his colleagues exposed mice to simulated conditions of anti-gravity, cosmic radiation, or both effects combined. After half a year (the equivalent of 20 human years), they found that only the mice that had been exposed to radiation had sustained damage to their blood vessels. In particular, the researchers found damage to the lining of the blood vessels, which is typically the first indication of long-term heart disease leading to a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mouse studies provide some indication that radiation exposure may have affected the cardiovascular health of Apollo astronauts, Dr. Delp said. Astronauts who fly in low Earth orbit, including those on the International Space Station, have the protection of the Earth's so-called magnetosphere, which provides shielding from radiation. Once the Apollo astronauts went beyond that magnetic bubble, their only protection against radiation came from the shielding of their spacecraft and spacesuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Delp said his team felt that it was important to release their findings, even with shortcomings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What it does is point to the fact that we need a lot more study on this,'' he said. ''One of the things that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and others have been most concerned about with space radiation is cancer. The cardiovascular system has barely gotten mentioned.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understanding how cosmic radiation affects blood vessels and the heart -- and then investigating possible solutions, such as antioxidants, exercise habits and better shielding on spacecraft -- may be relevant sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With federal funding for the International Space Station set to expire in 2024, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> wants to shift its focus to deep space, aiming to fly astronauts to an asteroid by 2025, and to Mars by the 2030s. China, Russia and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> are all looking into launching people to Mars, as well as establishing long-term bases on the moon. Private organizations have joined the fold as well, with Mars One and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> both expressing a wish to land people on Mars by the mid-2020s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With only 10 years before people are planning to send people back to deep space, we thought, 'We can sit on this study, or we can try to get it out there,''' Dr. Delp said. ''We felt it was important enough to get it out.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter's Great Red Spot is not only big and red. It's also hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using a telescope on Earth, astronomers peered at infrared emissions from Jupiter and found that the temperature of the upper atmosphere, 350 to 600 miles above the giant swirling storm, averages 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That finding, reported on Wednesday in a paper published in the journal Nature, is the latest piece of a puzzle that has been confusing planetary scientists since 1973 when <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Pioneer 10 spacecraft flew by and took the first temperature measurements of the solar system's biggest planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By their calculations, scientists expected that the warmth of sunlight impinging on Jupiter should heat the upper atmosphere to a cool -100 degrees. Instead, the temperature was about 1,000 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Essentially there's a bit of a crisis going on,'' said James O'Donoghue, a research scientist at Boston University and lead author of the Nature paper. ''That highlights a severe lack of knowledge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists searched for something to solve this planetary ''energy crisis.'' An obvious suspect was Jupiter's gargantuan auroras, the glow of charged particles accelerated along the magnetic field into the polar regions. Indeed, temperatures in the upper atmosphere at the top and bottom of Jupiter are around 1,700 degrees, fitting that explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as displayed by Jupiter's colorful bands, the winds on the planet blow east-west, not north-south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one has quite worked out how you distribute that energy from the polar regions down to the Equator,'' said Steve Miller, a professor of planetary science and science communication at University College London in England who was not involved in the research. ''There's a lot of energy there. Distributing it has been a problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. O'Donoghue and his colleagues used the <span class="companylink">NASA</span> Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii to focus on emissions of a particular ion in Jupiter's atmosphere -- a clump of three hydrogen atoms that is missing an electron, making it positively charged. The brightness of the emissions tells the temperature, and over the Great Red Spot, the infrared emissions were particularly bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests the heat is coming from below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spot is the largest storm in the solar system, some 10,000 miles wide, and it has persisted for centuries, although it is shrinking. (Historical observations put it at 25,000 miles wide in the 1800s.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists propose that the energy from the storm's turbulence is rising in the form of sound-like waves and then crashing in the tenuous upper atmosphere. The same effect, to a smaller extent, could explain the overall heating, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're producing some very plausible, if not 100 percent, convincing evidence that this is what is happening, at least above the Great Red Spot,'' Dr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy A. Simon, a senior scientist for planetary atmospheres research at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., described the work as an ''interesting theory.'' But she added, ''some caution is warranted,'' because methane glows at the same wavelength, potentially producing misleading temperature readings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Juno spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter this month, will try to take a closer look at the Great Red Spot, too, but its instruments are designed more to study the deep interior of the planet, not the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In our opinion, it's a huge mystery,'' Michael Janssen, who leads a microwave instrument on Juno, said of the Great Red Spot. The microwave measurements will tell the temperature and amount of water and help determine how far down the storm descends into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Janssen said the storm could be driven by water pushed up in the atmosphere, condensing, forming clouds and falling back down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juno will pass close to the spot in November. ''We'll be able to pick up some of the structure in the western side of the Great Red Spot,'' Dr. Janssen said. ''We're hoping to get at least some visibility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then on Aug. 9 next year, on Juno's 23rd science orbit, the Great Red Spot ''should be within view of our instrument,'' Dr. Janssen said, although that depends how far the spot drifts between now and then.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Inside an office in this city's South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and other technology companies with offices nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a satellite the size of a large duffel bag that will be lobbed into orbit in August, as part of a constellation of cameras that will take aerial pictures of Earth and deliver them to customers faster and cheaper than in the past. The company building it, Spaceflight Industries, is one of a growing number of start-ups springing up in Seattle for the same reasons the area has been so hospitable to internet and software companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's about software, big data, and it's about capital,'' said Jason Andrews, the chief executive of Spaceflight, which also arranges ''ride-shares'' -- think Uber for rockets -- for small satellites to tag along on bigger missions. ''Seattle is an epicenter for all three.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires -- Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft -- who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle's abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and aerospace experts from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we're putting the space back into the Space Needle,'' Charles Beames, the president of Vulcan Aerospace, Mr. Allen's space investment company, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's iconic tower, created for the 1962 World's Fair, long symbolized Seattle's perception of itself as a visionary town with an eye on the 21st century. That was initially rooted in its aviation prominence, which earned it the nickname Jet City. Software and the internet, though, created the vast wealth that allowed space junkies like Mr. Bezos and Mr. Allen, who grew up fascinated by the Apollo moon landings, to pursue their space dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bezos founded Blue Origin in nearby Kent, Wash. -- a company that recently launched its New Shepard rocket and returned it to a launchpad in Texas for the fourth time, demonstrating the reusability that is a key to making space access cheaper. Blue Origin recently said it planned to begin testing its rocket with astronauts next year, and aimed to begin sending space tourists on a short suborbital flight the year after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen's Vulcan Aerospace is funding the creation of the largest airplane in the world by wingspan, Stratolaunch, which will drop rockets from about 30,000 feet moments before they blast into space. Vulcan believes its approach will allow it to send satellites into space more reliably and efficiently by, for example, flying around bad weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plane is being built in Mojave, Calif., outside Los Angeles, though Vulcan is in Seattle. Entrepreneurs credit Mr. Allen with helping to ignite the current commercial gusto for space in 2004 when a rocket-powered plane he financed, SpaceShipOne, won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for becoming the first manned, reusable private spacecraft to reach space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another high-profile space entrepreneur, Elon Musk, doesn't have the same personal connection to the Seattle area. But he does visit to prospect for talent for his rocket company, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. Headquartered in Hawthorne, Calif., <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has centered its development of a satellite communications system in Redmond, Wash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason for it is pretty straightforward,'' Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. ''There's a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don't seem to want to move to L.A.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Planetary Resources</span>, a start-up in Redmond, Wash., has plans for one of the more implausible-sounding space businesses, dedicated to mining asteroids for materials like water. The hydrogen and oxygen in water can be processed in space into fuel for craft headed into deep space or satellites orbiting the earth, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun's energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing <span class="companylink">Planetary Resources</span> to capture water as it is baked out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Planetary Resources</span>, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewicki said in an interview that one of the company's largest teams was its software group. The supply of software and traditional aerospace talent made the Seattle area an obvious choice, said Mr. Lewicki, who worked at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on its Mars missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a powerhouse on both the software and hardware side,'' said Joe Landon, the chairman of the Space Angels Network, which connects private investors with space start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, the state formed a consortium, the Washington State Space Coalition, to help raise the fledgling industry's profile and improve communication among entrepreneurs, academics and government representatives. In a coup, the coalition lured a private space industry conference, NewSpace, to Seattle last month after it had been held in Silicon Valley for almost a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're trying to do in the state of Washington is we're trying to nurture that ecosystem,'' said John Thornquist, head of the state's Office of Aerospace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won't say how much they've invested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it remains to be seen whether Seattle's space scene can move beyond the relatively small number of companies and investors propping it up now to become a durable industry. At the NewSpace conference, an executive from <span class="companylink">Aerojet Rocketdyne</span>, which has been making space propulsion systems in the area for decades, told an audience to expect failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,'' said Fred Wilson, <span class="companylink">Aerojet Rocketdyne</span>'s director of marketing and business development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1965, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> opened the Boeing Space Center, a facility on 430 acres in nearby Kent, where it developed lunar rovers used on Apollo missions. In 2010, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> began selling off chunks of the property and moving employees to other locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way astronomers have peered through the haze is with the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Venus Express satellite, which orbited the veiled planet from 2006 until 2014. Data collected by the craft revealed how features on the surface, like mountains, can influence weather patterns many miles above.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We now have good evidence of a connection between the surface and what we see in the atmosphere that was never clear before,'' said Håkan Svedhem, project scientist for the E.S.A.'s Venus Express mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finding, which was published Monday in the Journal of Geophysical Research, might help researchers better understand the hurricane-like winds that blast a 12-mile-thick blanket of clouds around the planet. Venus's atmosphere undergoes a weather condition known as super-rotation. While the planet itself spins slowly along its axis, completing a full spin about once every 243 Earth days, its clouds move much faster, zooming around Venus in about four Earth days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On Venus what's strange is at the ground level the wind is very slow,'' said Jean-Loup Bertaux, a planetary scientist with the Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales in France, and the lead author of the paper. ''But the wind is faster and faster when you go up in altitude.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thick layer of clouds floats between 30 and 40 miles above the surface and can blow at more than 200 miles per hour, stronger than a category five hurricane. Winds on the surface move at only about two miles per hour, similar to a gentle breeze on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While studying the variations in wind speed, Dr. Bertaux and his team found a clue to how the planet's surface structures and its atmosphere were connected. They had noticed that above a mountainous region called the Aphrodite Terra, the winds were about 18 percent slower than in the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their next clue came when Dr. Bertaux's colleagues, who were studying water vapor trapped in clouds, noticed a particularly damp area about three miles above the Equator, near the Aphrodite Terra region. The third clue came when his colleagues, who were using ultraviolet light to measure the brightness of the clouds, noticed dark spots downstream from the mountains. Dr. Bertaux had his team plot the dark spots and the damp regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then: bingo,'' said Dr. Bertaux. ''I saw that, and finally I understood that the two are connected, the increase of water vapor and the increase of UV darkness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They concluded that when slow winds on the surface hit mountains they push upward, bringing water vapor-rich air higher into the atmosphere and creating something called gravity waves, which are wisps of air that form when wind flows over geological features (not to be confused with the ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the waves reach the mountain tops, they continue traveling up for miles while growing larger until they interact with fast, horizontally blowing winds. There, below the cloud tops, the gravity waves break against the horizontal winds like the surf on a shoreline, according to Dr. Bertaux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forces of the waves slow down the horizontal winds slightly and create an air pump or fountain that dumps the water vapor-rich clouds into the atmosphere. These very damp clouds then reaccelerate and move downstream, leaving behind the dark spots that the team saw under the UV light. By connecting the three clues, they showed how Venus's surface features affect the weather conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found the proof that you have gravity waves propagated by these very slow winds,'' said Dr. Bertaux. ''The mountains are revealing themselves, even on a completely cloudy planet.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood beyond Neptune is becoming ever more crowded, with astronomers announcing this week the discovery of another likely dwarf planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii has been tracking more than 600 bodies in a ring of icy debris known as the Kuiper belt. One of them turned out to be the likely dwarf planet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a big fish among a whole lot of small ones we're working with,'' said Michele Bannister, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Victoria in British Columbia who is working on the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year since <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto, planetary astronomers continue to make new discoveries in the Kuiper belt and what it might reveal about the earliest days of the solar system. The study of these objects also offers hints about the formation and migration of the gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the newly found world is a dwarf planet, however, it will probably be years before it might earn official designation -- part of the confusion of definitions that followed the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>'s decision in 2006 to demote Pluto and reduce the solar system to eight planets from nine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 100 bodies in the solar system, all but one located along the ring of icy debris beyond Neptune, appear to meet the definition of a dwarf planet, a category that the astronomical union created to describe Pluto as well as Ceres, the largest asteroid, and Eris, a Kuiper belt object slightly smaller than Pluto. (A full-statured planet has an additional requirement: It must have ''cleared the neighborhood'' of smaller debris.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If dwarf planets were to be reclassified as planets, as advocates for restoring Pluto to full planethood status hope to do, forget about ever trying to devise a workable mnemonic device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new object, designated 2015 RR245, was first spotted in February as the astronomers looked through images taken five months earlier. Further observations a few weeks ago confirmed the object's 700-year loping path around the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers cannot directly measure the object's size. Rather, from its brightness, how far away it is and an assumption of how reflective its surface is -- most Kuiper belt objects are roughly the darkness of coal -- they estimated the diameter to be 370 to 500 miles wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also cannot directly tell if 2015 RR245 is round -- the definition of a dwarf planet requires that the gravity is strong enough to pull the body into the shape of a ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mimas, a 250-mile-wide icy moon of Saturn, is round, and it is likely that the much larger 2015 RR245 is also round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomical union has been slow to designate new dwarf planets, adding just two since 2006: Haumea and Makemake. But there is a slew of additional Kuiper belt objects larger than Mimas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the 435-mile diameter is accurate, 2015 RR245 would rank as just the 19th largest potential dwarf planet. Larger objects include Quaoar, Orcus, Salacia and still-unnamed objects with temporary designations like ''2007 OR10'' and ''2002 MS4.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hate to say any Kuiper belt object is uninteresting, but it's a typical Kuiper belt object that is in the top 20 biggest ones,'' said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology who discovered Eris and most of the larger Kuiper belt objects through a sky survey a decade ago. ''This one is no more or less bizarre than most of them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown's computer keeps track of large Kuiper belt objects, and currently, 96 of them appear to be larger than Mimas and thus most likely to be round dwarf planets. Another 300 are smaller, but possibly could still be large enough to be round. Dwarf planets are ''not a rare class of objects in the outer solar system,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown and a colleague, Konstantin Batygin, further upended the field this year when they proposed the existence of a new planet, somewhere between the size of Earth and Neptune, in an orbit far beyond Pluto. They made their prediction based on the orbits of distant objects that all appeared to be aligned in roughly the same direction, nudged by the gravitational force of the unseen planet, which they are calling Planet Nine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bannister's dwarf planet is not distant enough to be affected by Planet Nine, but at least one of the 600 objects tracked by the survey is. She declined to give details, but has described it in talks, including one attended by Dr. Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know that it's going to fit in at least with most of the story,'' Dr. Brown said. ''It's exactly in the direction it should be for Planet Nine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown said Planet Nine, if it exists, could be confirmed in two to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of the New Horizons mission and one of Pluto's most vocal defenders, said the ninth planet was discovered long ago. ''My opinion about Planet Nine, which is Pluto, is just the same,'' he said. ''It's a planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He agrees with Dr. Brown's assertion that many objects as small as 2015 RR245 or smaller are almost certainly dwarf planets, and he thinks they should all be planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern has even gone a step further, arguing that round moons like Earth's moon should also be counted as planets. ''There are a lot of little guys,'' he said. ''We were just wrong to think that there were just a few planets and they were all close and they were all big like Jupiter or big like the Earth.''</p>

(Pics or it didn't happen.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images transmitted back to Earth after Juno began orbiting Jupiter now confirm the beginning of the space probe's 20-month mission around the solar system's largest planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, Juno's nascent path around Jupiter had been tracked by signals it was sending back. But <span class="companylink">NASA</span> on Tuesday released an image taken by the satellite on Sunday from a distance of 2.7 million miles; it even shows the Great Red Spot, though the famous storm has been shrinking in recent decades and may not be as great as it once was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're quite pleased that we survived going through Jupiter orbit insertion,'' said Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, a scientist at Planetary Science Institute in Tucson who is responsible for the operation of the camera. ''The fact it's a beautiful image is already a good thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's camera had been turned off as it approached Jupiter, and was only switched back on, along with other instruments, once the solar-powered probe survived its passage through the planet's massive radiation barrages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Juno moves outward on a 53-day orbit, it will be taking about four images an hour even as the size of Jupiter diminishes with the growing distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission has been relying on amateur astronomers on Earth to keep watch on what is going on in Jupiter's clouds, but the planet will soon be out of sight from Earth for a couple of months, behind the sun. With Juno's pictures, the scientists will be able to note any big changes in Jupiter's appearance. ''Stuff we'll able to resolve, we'll be able to keep an eye on while they're essentially blinded,'' Dr. Hansen-Koharcheck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the month, Juno will reach the farthest point of its orbit and then swing back around, passing within 2,600 miles of Jupiter's cloudtops on Aug. 27 for its first close approach with all of the instruments turned on. Juno will provide the first good views of Jupiter's north and south poles, and planetary scientists are curious to know whether turbulent vortices swirl in the polar regions as they do on Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On later orbits, Juno will continue photographing the poles, but where else the camera will focus will be open to a popular vote by the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mission Juno website already invites discussion on points of interest, similar to discussions mission scientists would hold. Beginning with the fourth pass in November, anyone can vote among several choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may finesse things a tiny bit,'' Dr. Hansen-Koharcheck said, to combine nearby targets or to take into account memory constraints on the spacecraft. ''But for the most part, we are going to have the priority determined by the voting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that if other members of the science team had something they wanted photographed, they would have to propose them on the website like anyone else and win the popular vote. ''They're going to have to lobby for it, and they might have to get all their friends and neighbors to vote on it,'' Dr. Hansen-Koharcheck said. ''Other than the north and south pole, there's not going to be any set-asides.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The specifications for the JunoCam called for it to last just eight of Juno's 37 orbits, but Dr. Hansen-Koharcheck said it is shielded so heavily that she thought it would make it through the entire mission.</p>
