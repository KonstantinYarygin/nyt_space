<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEHRAN, Oct. 28 -- Iranians hailed the recent voyage of the first woman to go into space as a private explorer, an Iranian-American, with two jokes that circulated widely on cellphones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muslim clerics, went the first, were refusing to look into the sky for the moon so that they could announce the beginning of Ramadan because they feared seeing the amateur astronaut without her veil.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second said the clerics had announced that fasting should last for two months instead of one, because they had seen two moons in the sky. In Persian, the moon is often used as a metaphor for a beautiful woman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fascination with the odyssey of the woman, Anousheh Ansari, a 40-year-old Iranian-born business executive, has gripped Iran, particularly the country's young women. Iranian television and newspapers have reviewed Mrs. Ansari's life and covered her 10 days in space, which started with a blastoff in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from Kazakhstan on Sept. 18 and included eight days at the International Space Station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranians told one another how she dreamed of going into space even as a child in Iran. They guessed at the trip's undisclosed price tag, widely assumed to be $20 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they openly admired her courage and her success. In 1993, she and her husband founded a business in Texas, Telecom Technologies Inc., which they sold in 2000 for $550 million in stock. (After the stock fell in value, shareholders sued, accusing Mrs. Ansari of insider trading. The case is pending.) Her blog, anoushehansari.com, is still being filled with comments from Iranians.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I saw your face on TV after you returned, I vowed that I will go to space just like you,'' wrote Mehrdad Younessi, 20, from Mazandaran, a province on the Caspian. ''Even if that does not happen, I assure you that I will study what you studied.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the attention has been positive. Some Iranians wondered why she went to space instead of using the money to help poor Iranians. And one comment posted on her blog said: ''Wow! I got to get me $30 million so I can become the poster child for the military-industrial complex. Good to know the rich can still do stuff that the rest of us can't.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to reach her for this article through her new company, Prodea Systems, were unsuccessful. But in an interview on NPR she said she had paid the price to achieve her dream. She has responded to her critics by saying that she did not believe she could solve the problems of Iran's women or the poor around the world ''by throwing money'' at them as long as there were corrupt governments that did not ensure that the money got to those in need.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tone was far warmer at an event that celebrated Mrs. Ansari's safe departure, held in Tehran on Sept. 21. It was sponsored by the state television network and drew more than 500 people, many of them young women.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had never seen so much enthusiasm for an Iranian woman,'' said Roya Karimi, a journalist covering the event for Zanan magazine, a feminist publication. ''Young girls talked about their dreams, and it was like their own dreams had come true.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Karimi said one 17-year-old recited parts of Mrs. Ansari's online diary from memory. A 24-year-old told Ms. Karimi that Mrs. Ansari was ''her role model and symbol of an Iranian woman'' -- but a lucky one to have become rich and have a family who supported her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such notes of realism, verging on wistfulness, are not uncommon among Iranian women.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Merina Baqeri, 25, said she was very happy about Mrs. Ansari's trip. ''But I could never do something like that,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She probably had a supportive family,'' she concluded, citing her own as a contrast. ''My father did not even let me study arts because he wanted me to become a doctor.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some women's rights advocates have distanced themselves from Mrs. Ansari.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Feminists believe that Mrs. Ansari has done nothing for their cause,'' said Mahnaz Mohammadi, a feminist filmmaker who is currently helping to organize a campaign to gather a million signatures for a petition demanding equal rights for Iran's women.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What she did was great, but they decided to distance themselves from her because of the way the Islamic Republic proclaimed her,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state news media, as well as opposition satellite channels, broadcast news about Mrs. Ansari's trip this summer. State television conducted a telephone interview with Mrs. Ansari before her flight, and other news outlets reported the details of her journey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jam-e-Jam, a state-run newspaper with the largest circulation in Iran, published daily columns with her photo showing her without the obligatory veil worn by women in Iran.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody in Iran will pray for her safe landing,'' a columnist wrote on Sept. 28. ''She proved to be qualified for this trip and will walk out tomorrow proudly.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only one daily, the hard-line Jomhouri Eslami, has criticized the attention paid to Mrs. Ansari, warning that she was a bad role model and accusing her of being a royalist.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, all of the state news media criticized Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights lawyer, for not wearing a veil when she accepted the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her acceptance speech, Ms. Ebadi declared that the prize would inspire women across the Muslim world to fight for equality in oppressive, patriarchal societies. It certainly galvanized the Iranian women's movement, which has grown more active, despite government pressure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, they won a major campaign with the passage of a law permitting the children of Iranian mothers and foreign fathers to receive Iranian citizenship after they reach 18. Advocates are continuing to press for the children of such unions to be declared Iranian citizens at birth.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrying 16 instruments each, the satellites are to help scientists predict the billion-ton eruptions of electrified gas and deadly particles known as coronal mass ejections that cause the Northern Lights and can disrupt power grids on Earth.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, called Stereo, for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, is the first in which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will use the tug of the Moon's gravity to send spacecraft to their final orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To gather 3-D views of the Sun, the two satellites have to fly in separate orbits so they can perceive depth, like a pair of human eyes. The orbits will closely track Earth's, but the two satellites will gradually separate, so that in four years they will be on opposite sides of the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project scientist for the mission, Michael Kaiser, said the coronal mass ejections were the most powerful solar phenomena.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They also cause electrical damage to spacecraft that are in orbit or even the ground power systems and, conceivably, even astronauts if they were exposed to one of these storms,'' Mr. Kaiser said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russ Howard, a scientist with the Naval Research Laboratory, said the eruptions were a concern to fliers on polar routes, where the number of solar particles is much higher than normal and Earth's protective magnetic field is weaker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kaiser said that at different times on the mission, each instrument would be at its most favorable position to study solar features.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another mission scientist, Janet G. Luhmann of the University of California, Los Angeles, said that even when the stereoscopic ability was limited the satellites would ''have a broadside view of the speed at which things are approaching the Earth.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration has adopted a jingoistic and downright belligerent tone toward space operations. In a new ''national space policy'' posted without fanfare on an obscure government Web site, and in recent speeches, it has signaled its determination to be pre-eminent in space -- as it is in air power and sea power -- while opposing any treaties that might curtail any American action there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This chest-thumping is being portrayed as a modest extension of the Clinton administration's space policy issued a decade ago. And so far there is no mention of putting American weapons in space. But the more aggressive tone of the Bush policy may undercut international cooperation on civilian space projects -- a goal to which the new policy subscribes -- or set off an eventual arms race in space.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new policy reflects the worst tendencies of the Bush administration -- a unilateral drive for supremacy and a rejection of treaties. And it comes just as the White House is desperately seeking help to rein in the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran. That effort depends heavily on cooperation from China and Russia, two countries with their own active space programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration regards the policy as a necessary update to reflect how important space is becoming for the American economy and defense. But outside experts who have parsed the language are struck by how forceful and nationalistic it sounds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas the 1996 policy opened with assurances that the United States would pursue greater levels of partnership and cooperation in space, the new policy states: ''In this new century, those who effectively utilize space will enjoy added prosperity and security and will hold a substantial advantage over those who do not. Freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only solace is that the new policy does not endorse placing weapons in space or fighting in, through or from space, as the Air Force has been urging. But neither does it rule out these activities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with the more muscular stance, the administration is also opposing any negotiations on a treaty to prevent an arms race in outer space -- arguing that it may impede America's ability to defend its satellites from ground-based weapons. That seems shortsighted. An international treaty to keep space free of weapons might well provide greater security than a unilateral declaration that we will do whatever we have to do to preserve our own space assets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, insisted he did not intend to sound jingoistic when he addressed a conference in Spain this month -- but he sure came across that way. He wondered aloud what language future settlers of the Moon and Mars would speak. ''Will my language be passed down over the generations to future lunar colonies?'' he asked. ''Or will another, bolder or more persistent culture surpass our efforts and put their own stamp on the predominant lunar society of the far future?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We fear the old notion that space might provide the perfect arena for international cooperation may be yielding to a new era of competition -- one not seen since the cold war race to the moon.   </p>

McNair, one of the astronauts who died aboard the Challenger space shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years nothing happened. The lot became an illegal dumping ground for contractors, who used it to dispose of building material, and at night as a safe haven for drug users, who would periodically cut through the chain-link fence on the perimeter.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The playground, costing $2 million, on East 122nd Street near Lexington Avenue, had its original groundbreaking on Oct. 23, 1986, when Mayor Edward I. Koch presided at the ceremony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McNair, a physicist who in 1984 became the second African-American to make a space flight, died aboard the Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, when the shuttle exploded 73 seconds after takeoff. Six other astronauts also died in the accident, which was caused by the failure of an O-ring seal in the solid fuel rocket.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A native of South Carolina, Dr. McNair was selected from a pool of 10,000 applicants to become an astronaut in 1978. He was married and had two children.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Francis Grant, Dr. McNair's cousin, said yesterday that the site of the playground was appropriate because Dr. McNair's father, Carl McNair, had once owned an auto body shop next to the lot. ''He would talk about him all the time, and one day he showed me the title of his master's thesis,'' Mr. Grant said. ''We couldn't even pronounce it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city said the delay in developing the playground was a result of a lack of financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've only been waiting 20 years for this,'' Commissioner Adrian Benepe of the Parks Department said at the ceremony. ''It's amazing to say we all lived to see the day.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-acre park contains items that show the size of the solar system's planets in proportion, ranging from Jupiter, a gaseous giant, represented by a 77-foot-8-inch granite ring circling the park's green artificial turf field, to Pluto, the barren block of ice that has lost its place as a planet. It is represented by a circle 15 inches in diameter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The play equipment, including a climbing set that was based on the spaceship in the film ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' features various space-related gear, including minitelescopes. The park also has a piece illustrating the phases of the moon, two spinning machines that are about as close as a child will come to the stomach-churning nausea of space flight, and a spray shower in which water spouts from a concrete moon.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nerves jangling, he awaits the moment when Carpe Diem, his homemade 18-foot-long rocket, hurls itself heavenward with 737 pounds of thrust, shockwaves -- or ''mach diamonds'' -- surging from its supersonic exhaust. With dazed exuberance he watches it recede into deep blue sky, and then, with the release of parachutes, gently drift four miles away, preserved for another flight.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a cultural moment when billionaires like Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, and Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic chairman, are getting into the space business, the members of the Tripoli Rocketry Association are the ultimate do-it-yourselfers -- backyard versions of Burt Rutan, the legendary engineer of the first privately financed manned rocket.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Florham Park, N.J., and as far away as London, 100 launchers came -- plumbers, paint contractors, firefighters, bankers and Silicon Valley techies united by their passion for building rockets capable of blasting 94,000 feet into the air, at nearly three-and-one-half times the speed of sound, as one record-setter did this weekend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of a subculture, the hobbyists have been known to launch Weber grills, Port-A-Potties, bowling balls and pink flamingos. But once a year, on this bleak, 400-square-mile dry lake bed, they meet for the Indy 500 of rocketry, with waivers from the Federal Aviation Administration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the subculture itself is on the defensive, unsure whether it will soar or come crashing down in a ''cato'' -- lingo for a catastrophic failure. Since Sept. 11, the rocketeers, about 6,000 nationwide, have had to contend with tougher restrictions from the federal government and local fire marshals, and are involved in a seven-year-old dispute with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives over their use of a propellant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bearing names like Questionable Mental Health and the Procrastinator, their rockets are usually restricted to low-altitude launchings from sorghum fields in Kansas, sod farms in South Carolina and frozen Lake Champlain in winter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of guys close their eyes and see women. I close my eyes and see rockets,'' said Ky Michaelson, 68, a junior high school drop-out from Bloomington, Minn., who has been called ''the sultan of thrust'' by Outside Magazine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Michaelson shot the first amateur rocket into space, and his inventions include a rocket-powered sled that zooms uphill. His record-breaking launching was 72 miles up, at 3,420 miles per hour -- factoids embroidered on his rocket-red satin shirt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of his brethren, Mr. Michaelson developed his passion early with a chemistry set he got for Christmas. He graduated to launching rocket cars in an alley in southern Minneapolis, and today he fills his home with space collectibles, including a hand-held toilet from the Russian space station Mir.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talk in Nevada was technical minutiae -- thrust ratios, fuel efficiency, altitudes. Even over a ravioli dinner at Bruno's Country Club and Casino,the hobbyists were constantly gesturing in an upward trajectory, forks in hand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apogee of the weekend is when they push the button launching creations that teams have spent up to a year making at a cost of thousands of dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every time I launch a rocket, a little of me goes up with it,'' said Derek Stavenger, a 50-year-old painter from San Francisco. ''It's about escaping the bounds of our restrictive existence on the planet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the extreme rocketeers have seen their ranks dwindle. In many parts of the country, rockets are prohibited. Local groups face a welter of ordinances and safety codes, as well as F.A.A. restrictions. Tripoli extreme rocketeers also need federal low-explosives permits. On Tuesday, lawyers representing Tripoli and the National Association of Rocketry and officials of the firearms bureau will head to Federal District Court in Washington to resolve the seven-year-old dispute over the hobbyists' use of a flammable propellant, ammonium perchlorate composite, or APCP. The chemical is the main ingredient on the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firearms bureau classifies APCP as an explosive and, amid post-Sept. 11 security concerns, requires that anyone who uses more than two ounces of propellant undergo federal background checks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I was an 18-year-old and told my mom I needed a low explosives permit and that an A.T.F. agent would come to my house, she'd say, Why don't you just continue with your guitar lessons?'' grumbled Ken Good, the president of Tripoli and a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rocketeers say the agency has no right to regulate the propellant because it does not explode but rather ''deflagrates,'' or burns intensely at a controlled rate, like a road flare.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency is also concerned that large rockets could be used as weapons. But weapons experts say it is doubtful that the rockets could be significant threats because they do not have guidance systems, which are prohibited by federal law.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Designing a rocket to go straight up and down is hugely different than making it controllable to hit any kind of a target,'' said John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the unpredictable does happen. With a spectacular kaboom, an elegantly minimalist rocket designed by Alex McLaughlin, 29, a software engineer from Portland, Ore., broke apart at around 40,000 feet, the hobby rocket equivalent of the Death Zone on Mount Everest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an unforgiving hobby, but it is arguably safer for participants than in the past. Like many of the Black Rock ''rocket rats'' -- largely men of a certain age -- Mike Mullane, 61, a retired space shuttle astronaut, recalled his boyhood rocketry experiments with black powder and other dangerous substances. Mr. Mullane said he was ''reborn'' the day Sputnik was launched in 1957. ''It was the 9/11 of my childhood, a blow to the American ego,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The horizon was soon populated with rocket and moon clubs, with schools ''passing out formulas for rocket fuel,'' he said. Before the arrival of Estes rocket kits, ''the only game in town was getting a steel tube, mixing hazardous material and lighting fuses in the desert,'' an activity, he said, that was far riskier than three flights on the space shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 20, 60 members of Tripoli will launch high-powered rockets at the first X Prize Cup in Las Cruces, N.M., in an expo that bills itself as ''the world's first space show.'' The X Prize Foundation of Santa Monica, Calif., richly rewards private space innovation. The rocketeers will try to launch an unmanned replica of the Mercury Redstone, which first transported Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom into space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With space entrepreneurship on the rise, including plans by Robert Bigelow, the owner of Budget Suites hotel chain, to invest $500 million in an inflatable space hotel for tourists, even members of this proletariat rocket nation are being tapped for real projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Carmack, a member who is also the creator of the games Quake and Doom, recruited fellow hobbyists to help design a lunar landing vehicle for a competition sponsored by NASA and the X Prize Foundation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's more important to me to get people who are building, testing and flying things than an aerospace graduate who has never screwed two bolts together,'' Mr. Carmack said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Reese, 19, a member of Tripoli since age 8, now works at the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory at the University of Southern California, where he is helping to develop a carbon fiber vehicle designed to go to the edge of space. He ecstatically broke his own record at Black Rock, with a launching of 17,230 feet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Sony Playstation motto is, 'Leave your world here and play in ours,' '' Mr. Reese said of a more ubiquitous teenage pastime. ''But why leave this world when you can hang out with a bunch of nerds and play with rockets in the middle of the desert?''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 -- NASA's Opportunity Mars rover spent 22 months trekking almost six miles to a large scientifically promising crater. Like a tourist who asks a passer-by to take a picture for proof he made it to a famous site, the robot rover has had another spacecraft snap an image of it sitting on the rim.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists said Friday that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a powerful explorer that just settled into its ideal scientific orbit, had used its high-resolution camera this week to spot the golf-cart-size rover sitting on the side of Victoria Crater.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remarkably detailed picture, taken on Wednesday from 186 miles above Mars's surface, shows the rover and its five-foot-high camera mast at the edge of the big impact crater and the robot's tracks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a tremendous example of how our Mars missions in orbit and on the surface are designed to reinforce each other and expand our ability to explore and discover,'' Douglas McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA, said at a news conference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfred S. McEwen of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the orbiter's high-resolution camera, said the picture of Victoria Crater and its visitor was one of the first images taken. Mr. McEwen said the image of the crater's jagged rock formations was made on the first effort to take a picture away from the spacecraft's direction of travel. ''It worked fabulously well,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter, the most advanced craft sent to Mars, arrived in March and has been refining its orbit and testing its six instruments designed to study Mars for years during a $720 million mission. These include the most powerful telescopic camera ever sent to another planet, a mineral mapper to identify water-related areas, radar to investigate for buried ice and water and a weather camera to monitor the planet daily.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after nearly three years on the surface and as new craft arrive to study Mars, NASA's durable twin rovers, the Opportunity and the Spirit, are making major discoveries. Steven Squyres of Cornell, the principal investigator for the rovers, said the aerial views would enhance operations on the ground, particularly exploration of Victoria Crater.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you were a geologist driving up to the edge of a crater in your jeep, the first thing you would do would be to pick up the aerial photo you brought with you and use it to understand what you're seeing from ground level,'' he said. ''That's exactly what we're doing here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both rovers have lasted more than 10 times their 90-day mission-design life, Mr. Squyres said, and scientists decided to send the Opportunity on the trek to Victoria Crater after it had spent months exploring two other craters. Victoria Crater, more than a half mile across and hundreds of feet deep, is five times larger than any other explored crater and may hold evidence of a longer span of the planet's history, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rover researchers are formulating a plan for how the Opportunity will tackle the crater. The craft will role to the edge of different promontories and do stereo imaging of the layered cliffs and boulders dotting the depression, Mr. Squyres said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the robot will do a partial circumnavigation of the crater, aided by images from the orbiter, to find the best pathway for it to go into the depression and return without becoming stuck in sand dunes, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not interested in making a suicide dive into this crater,'' Mr. Squyres said. ''It's perilous terrain, and we want a safe way in and out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one knows how long the Opportunity or the Spirit, which is at Gusev Crater on the opposite side of the planet, will last, he said, so scientists want to move quickly but carefully in their explorations.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The micrometeoroid did not damage the delicate thermal panels and tiles that protect the shuttle on its return to earth; instead, it struck a radiator panel that extends from the payload bay doors. The doors hang open during missions to get rid of heat produced by the shuttle's systems.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By historical standards, it was a major hit, said James Hartsfield, a NASA spokesman, who called it ''the second-most-damaging particle that we've encountered in the program.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hartsfield added, however, that the damage was slight. ''It posed no danger to the crew and no change to the mission,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hole is about a tenth of an inch in diameter at the entry point, with damage extending about an inch around and a half inch deep within the radiator itself, where the particle shattered. On the other side of the radiator, it left an exit hole three-hundredths of an inch in diameter and a crack two-tenths of an inch long.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radiators are tucked inside the bay when the doors are closed shortly before returning to earth, so the damaged area never faced the searing heat of re-entry. It was superheated plasma entering a hole in the wing of the shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003, that caused the loss of that craft and its crew of seven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obvious high velocity of the impact meant that the debris that struck the Atlantis did not come from the shuttle itself, Mr. Hartsfield said, since objects floating away from the shuttle have a low velocity relative to the speed of the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existence of the hole was first reported yesterday on the Web site nasaspaceflight.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tubes in which freon coolant circulates were not punctured; such a problem would have been detected quickly and would have required a hasty return to earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteoroid debris is one of the biggest risks of space flight, and astronauts inspect the shields at the end of every mission to ensure that there has been no new damage to them during orbit. If a heat shield had suffered a hit of the same size, Mr. Hartsfield said, the damage would have been spotted in the inspection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Hartsfield said, ''Basically, every flight comes back with some type of impact,'' and so ''when you see damage like this, I wouldn't say people are really surprised.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The COBE satellite was part of NASA's Explorers Program, which uses small satellites to conduct important studies that don't need gigantic, costly space platforms. Yet these and similar small-scale missions were disproportionately cut to free up money for more grandiose programs. The Nobel award suggests that NASA needs to rebalance its portfolio, a task the agency says is in progress.   </p>

Yesterday, astronomers who use the Hubble Space Telescope announced that they had done it again, this time locating the fastest moving and most distant ever found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among a batch of new planets found by training the Hubble telescope on a small patch of sky far across the galaxy in Sagittarius are as many as five that orbit their home stars in less than a day.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One planet orbits its star, a so-called dwarf slightly smaller than the Sun, in only 10 hours, ''the likes of which we had never seen before,'' Kailash Sahu of the Space Telescope Science Institute, leader of the team that did the work, said, calling the results ''a big surprise.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, Mercury, swiftest in the our solar system, races around the Sun once every 88 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planets, all roughly the size of Jupiter, orbit so near their stars that they are heated to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, said Dr. Sahu, who noted that if their home stars were any bigger, the planets would simply evaporate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers reported their results at a news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, and their findings will be published in the journal Nature today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, astronomers said, confirm that planets occur across the galaxy with the same frequency that they do in the neighborhood around the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've learned now that planets are everywhere,'' said Alan P. Boss, a theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who was not part of the team.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're beginning to be able to calculate how many Earths there are, how many planets are habitable, if not inhabited,'' Dr. Boss added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 200 planets have now been found around other stars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the project -- known as Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search, or Sweeps -- found 16 possible planets by monitoring the light from 180,000 stars over seven days, looking for the periodic dimming caused by the passage of a planet. The astronomers have calculated by statistical methods that at least seven of the bodies are actually planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, two have been confirmed as planets by measuring the wobbles in the starlight caused by the passing masses, using the giant eight-meter Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory on Cerro Paranal, in Chile.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sahu said those findings gave him confidence that at least a large fraction of the 16, if not all, are really planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss noted that astronomers now had found in the Milky Way all the types of planets that are in our solar system: gas giants like Jupiter, ice giants like Neptune and rocky ''super-Earths'' orbiting other stars. ''Everything we were looking for,'' he said, ''just not in the arrangement we were looking for.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As potential planets are found in increasing numbers, Dr. Boss said, the odds increase that planets and planetary systems like Earth's would be found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mario Livio, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and a member of Dr. Sahu's team, said, ''There are literally billions of planets in our galaxy.''  </p>

Griffin, said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking in Shanghai toward the end of the first visit to China by top officials from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Mr. Griffin said there were ''no current plans to work with China on the space shuttle and space station programs.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin, who characterized the five-day visit as enjoyable and informative, said that it was too early to talk about any cooperative programs between the nations, but that the first steps probably would be in data sharing and some type of joint effort with robotic spacecraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did discuss closer cooperation in our nations' science programs,'' Mr. Griffin said during a news conference in which American reporters participated by telephone. ''We're all very encouraged by those initial discussions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said earlier that the International Space Station program involving the United States and 15 other nations had well-established partnerships after almost 13 years and that he would not propose changing it. And since the space shuttle program is to close down in 2010 with the retirement of the three remaining orbiters, there is little prospect of Chinese involvement, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, only the third nation, after Russia and the United States, with the capacity to send humans into space, has been seeking more international cooperation in space projects, but Washington has been reluctant because of such issues as technology transfer, trading weapons technology and human rights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest difficulty, Mr. Griffin said, was with a civilian agency like NASA working with a Chinese space program dominated by that country's military. Aside from concerns about national security issues, like missile technology proliferation, human space cooperation ''requires a great deal of trust and openness.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partners in human space flight have to understand one another's equipment, systems and procedures completely, as the United States and Russia have learned to do, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to have a great degree of trust. If not, there is a real danger in the mix,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''If we're going to fly together, we're going to have to depend on each other.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said the NASA group chose not to visit the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, an extensive rocket-launching complex in the Gobi Desert from which the Chinese prepare and fly their manned spacecraft and keep an extensive inventory of rockets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials had received permission to visit the base, which is operated by the People's Liberation Army. But they were told that the tour would be limited to the launching pads and that they would not have access to the buildings where spacecraft are tested and prepared for launching. Mr. Griffin said that if he had been allowed to see the engineering facilities and have ''eye-level discussions'' with fellow engineers, he would have gone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not a tourist; this is, in fact, my profession,'' Mr. Griffin said at the news conference. ''I have seen a lot of launch pads in my time and didn't need to go that far to see another one.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin said his ''get acquainted'' visit, during which he met Chinese space officials and toured a number of science centers, had generally been ''very enjoyable'' and informative.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our hosts could hardly have been nicer,'' he said. ''This is our very first visit. It's not our last visit.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has repeatedly cautioned that the tour, which will include Beijing, Shanghai and a desert launching site in Gansu Province, will be an exploratory visit that will not result in any bilateral space agreements or formal partnerships.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is the third country, after the United States and Russia, to have sent humans into space. It has been seeking more international cooperation in aerospace projects, but the United States has been reluctant. Much of China's program is run by the military, raising concerns about possible technology transfers or other national security issues for any such cooperation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with China in space has also been hampered by other issues under discussion by the two nations, like weapons proliferation, trade agreements, patent and trademark enforcement, and human rights, said a senior adviser at NASA, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, though, the American position has begun to shift. When Chinese space officials invited the previous NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, to visit their operations two years ago, nothing came of the overture. However, when President Hu Jintao of China visited the United States in April and made the same request of Mr. Griffin, President Bush accepted the invitation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a policy decision by the Bush White House to do this,'' said John Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''It's part of an effort to engage China, to open a dialogue that may influence their policies in other areas. But it's starting slowly and deliberately.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanying Mr. Griffin on the trip is William Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for space operations, Michael F. O'Brien, the assistant administrator for external relations, and Shannon Lucid, a veteran astronaut. Ms. Lucid, who is the daughter of Baptist missionaries, was born in Shanghai and is returning to China for the first time since her childhood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group will meet Sun Laiyan, the administrator of the China National Space Administration in Beijing and tour aerospace operations and science centers there before going to Shanghai to visit space manufacturing plants there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also scheduled on the five-day trip is a visit to the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, an extensive rocket-launching complex from which the Chinese prepare and fly their manned spacecraft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese launched their first manned spacecraft, Shenzhou, in October 2003, sending one astronaut into orbit for a day. In 2005, a Shenzhou with a two-person crew spent five days in orbit. Chinese authorities said their third mission, set for fall 2007, will send up three astronauts and will include spacewalks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Chinese officials visiting the United States outlined their plans for an extensive program of manned and unmanned programs, including orbiting a small, staffed space station by 2015 and establishing a moon program that includes sending a robotic orbiter next year, a lunar rover in 2012 and a lander that would return a moon sample to Earth in 2017. While there are no immediate plans to do so, Chinese officials also have expressed interest in sending humans to the moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent G. Sabathier, a senior fellow on space issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that in the past, the United States had tried to contain Chinese ambitions in space but that this was no longer possible. China has major space agreements with Russia, Europe and most other nations with space programs, and is clearly striving to have a major role in the area, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chinese are going their way and have a strategy in place,'' Mr. Sabathier said. ''They want to work with the United States and be accepted as a major player, and the U.S. is obviously now seeing some potential in working with them, which explains Mr. Griffin's trip.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sabathier and other experts said the composition of Mr. Griffin's team, including the head of NASA's human space flight program and Ms. Lucid, whose five trips to space included a long stay aboard the Russian Mir space station, suggests that some type of cooperation in space may be under consideration.  </p>

They worked with the grunts and wheezes -- but not the curses -- familiar to anyone who has ever had to change a tire or hook up a bathroom sink.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, after Atlantis headed back toward Earth, astronauts on the station had to take emergency measures when a finicky machine, the Elektron oxygen generator, overheated and melted a rubber seal, sending a stench and small amount of smoke into the closed environment of the station.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ad astra per aspera, sure, but bolts and plumbing? The venerable Latin epigram, which means ''to the stars, with difficulty,'' probably wasn't supposed to be about such mundane matters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From now until the scheduled end of the shuttle program in 2010, however, every mission currently planned will focus on station construction, and astronauts will continue to wrestle with the occasional frozen bolt, malfunctioning gizmo or other glitch. So why does NASA send brainiacs -- the two Atlantis spacewalkers had advanced degrees in physics and aeronautics -- when the missions might profit from a couple of shade-tree mechanics and seasoned construction workers?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's obviously a legitimate question,'' said Robert Mirelson, a spokesman at NASA headquarters. ''Do you need to be a rocket scientist to be an astronaut?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With all the space tourists,'' he joked, ''there are probably some plumbers out there who could afford to go to the space station.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mirelson argued that because they go to space in small teams, astronauts must have a broad range of skills. But they can't know everything, he said, so NASA's mission controllers have experts on call at all hours to advise them, especially when something goes wrong.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Mullane, an astronaut who came to space by way of the Air Force, said he was the ''Forrest Gump of astronauts'' because he felt underpowered in the brains department compared with some of his credentials-heavy colleagues. He said he knew the importance of mechanical ingenuity: on a family trip, his father once nursed an overheated car across the deserted mountains of southern New Mexico by having the Mullane boys urinate into the radiator.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said, that outside-of-the-box thinking might not be the best approach in orbit, where a mistake could bring on disaster. ''You're never going to say, 'Oh, something's broken -- I'm going to get the toolbox and rip into this,' '' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So astronauts work under the close supervision of mission control, an arrangement that hardly calls for mechanical genius, Mr. Mullane said. The work can be done by ''anybody with a basic understanding of a screwdriver and a wrench,'' he said, ''and even most Ph.D.'s have that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Jones, a former astronaut who has a doctorate in planetary science, said NASA's rigorous training instilled the ability to handle every task. ''By the time you get up there, you're not bad as a person who can follow directions and deal with this equipment,'' he said. ''We get by.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Mr. Jones added, he feels confident tackling home and automotive repair work that he never did before his astronaut training. ''What a wonderful gift from the taxpayer,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronauts are accomplished handymen. Don Pettit has stripped and rebuilt a jet engine in his home workshop. During his stay aboard the station in 2002-03, he cobbled together a camera mount that, with a power drill as its driver, could precisely track the relative motion of the Earth and station to produce spectacular long-exposure photographs. And, he said, he is far from unique. ''You've got a lot of tinkerers'' among the astronaut corps, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, Mr. Pettit said, NASA engineers on the ground have resisted the idea of astronauts fixing things in space, and have tried to make systems redundant so repairs won't be necessary. When he was on the space station, he recalled, he overcame engineers' doubts by repairing his wristwatch. ''All of a sudden, they let me fix things'' that were not originally intended to be repaired in space, like a broken freezer that was used for science experiments, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jeffrey A. Hoffman, a former astronaut who has a doctorate in astrophysics and teaches aerospace engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was in on the selection of several astronaut classes before leaving the space agency in 1997. As the science component of missions grew, they brought in more Ph.D.'s; later, as station construction loomed large, they selected more engineers and people with operational experience.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any construction worker hired to go into orbit would be hard pressed to meet the other demands of the job and the complexity of the equipment, he said. ''You can't just give somebody a space suit and tell him, 'Go build a space station,' '' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, he said, it's too late for that. With the shuttle program set to be wound down by 2010 and the next generation of space vehicles years away, he said, ''I think it will be a while before we select any new astronauts.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've never been great fans of the International Space Station, an enormously costly project that will yield such limited scientific and economic benefits that it seems destined to be considered a white elephant. Nevertheless, we had to marvel at the magnificent performance of the crew of the shuttle Atlantis, which ended an arduous 12-day mission to the station with a flawless landing yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight drove home the point that the greatest value of the space station undertaking is simply the experience of building such a large and complex structure in space, far from the nearest hardware store or emergency repairman. Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, aptly described the station as ''one of the most amazing construction projects that human beings have ever undertaken.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the third shuttle flight since the disastrous loss of the Columbia in 2003 and the first devoted to resuming construction of the station. The astronauts spent three long days working in open space. The only glitches and human fumbles seemed minor and easily surmounted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in years it seems possible that NASA may actually be able to finish the station by 2010 and then retire the aging shuttle fleet so as to free up money for new vehicles to carry out the more ambitious program to explore the Moon and eventually Mars. The only caveat is that this flight went so smoothly in part because the crew, which was grounded after the Columbia accident, had more than four years to get ready.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no evidence that the shuttle's delicate heat shield had been hit by chunks of debris like that which doomed the Columbia. This was the second successive flight without debris damage, suggesting that NASA's redesign of the external fuel tanks that previously shed foam has made the shuttles much safer. It should now be safe enough to launch at night, thus opening many more launch windows for the flights needed to complete the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our main hope is that a seemingly safer shuttle and new abilities to inspect shuttles in orbit and possibly even make small repairs will enable a mission to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope before its batteries and gyroscopes run down. Mr. Griffin said NASA wants to service the Hubble by early 2008 if it can be done safely. He rightly described the Hubble as ''one of the great scientific instruments of all time,'' responsible for fundamental discoveries about the universe that would otherwise not be known. It seems more important to service the Hubble than to finish a station whose main value will be the act of finishing it.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're back in a more operational tempo now,'' Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said at a news conference after the landing.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis fired its engines at 5:14 a.m. for 2 minutes 40 seconds, slowing it by about 205 miles per hour and sending it falling back toward Earth. It descended into the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, crossing the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico and then the Gulf of Mexico, approaching Florida from the southwest. It touched down at the Kennedy Space Center at 6:21 a.m.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sky was still dark, the 15th time the shuttle has landed at night at the space center, and the weather was ideal: clear and no winds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's nice to be back,'' Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr., the shuttle commander, told controllers right after landing. ''It was a great team effort so I think assembly is off to a good start.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis rolled to a stop during its 187th circuit around Earth, having traveled 4.91 million miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary inspection found little damage to the shuttle's underside, a focus of concern since the loss of the Columbia and its seven astronauts in 2003. That orbiter disintegrated on re-entry because of damage to its wing caused by a piece of foam that fell from the external fuel tank during liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She looks as good or better than Discovery did after her last mission,'' said Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launch director.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin, who greeted the Atlantis's six astronauts as they stepped off the shuttle on the runway, said he saw only half a dozen dings in the shuttle's heat tiles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're very hard to find,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''They were the size of my thumbnail, and they didn't have any penetration to them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of the 12-day mission could lead NASA to lift, possibly as soon as the next shuttle mission in December, its post-Columbia restriction of launching only during daytime to allow cameras a clear view of the underside as it heads to orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis's landing was delayed by one day, because an object was spotted floating near the shuttle and sensors in its wings registered impacts. Several other objects were spotted later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To allay concerns that pieces of the shuttle's all-important heat shield had somehow been broken off, astronauts spent Wednesday surveying the Atlantis's underside for damage. They saw none, and the shuttle was cleared for its return.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stormy weather at the space center on Wednesday morning would probably have kept the Atlantis in orbit another day anyway, mission managers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One piece of the debris was probably a piece of plastic, spotted in an earlier inspection, that was wedged between the thermal tiles and then presumably shaken loose during tests of the hydraulic systems; the shaking also set off the wing sensors. The other debris might have been plastic bags or other items floating out of the shuttle's cargo bay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be honest with you, actually we were not very concerned,'' Captain Jett said in a post-flight news conference. ''From our experience on shuttle flights, we've seen a lot of things float out of the payload bay.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts accomplished their primary goal of hauling up a 35,000-pound segment to the space station, the first addition in four years. During their mission, they made three spacewalks to install the segment, which included solar arrays to generate electricity for the station and a radiator to dissipate excess heat.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a day of inspections, they said the craft showed no sign of damage, and they cleared it to land early Thursday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after a 12-day mission to the International Space Station.  </p>

''Nothing was found to be missing or damaged from the thermal protection system, the heat shield of the space shuttle Atlantis, or, in fact, any other part of the shuttle Atlantis.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle has two landing opportunities on successive orbits at 6:21 a.m. and 7:57 a.m. Eastern time, and the weather is predicted to be ideal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing had first been set for Wednesday morning, but the National Aeronautics and Space Administration kept the Atlantis in orbit an extra day while engineers tried to determine if a small object floating nearby indicated possible damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle crew used a 50-foot robotic arm to examine the heat shield, then attached a 50-foot boom extension with other sensors on the end to check harder-to-reach places. Nothing unusual turned up in the added inspections, agency officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said the object was probably a small plastic shim used to separate thermal tiles on the bottom of the orbiter. The shim and another type of felt tile spacer had earlier been seen protruding from the craft near a fuel line door, but the latest inspection showed they were no longer visible. They were probably shaken loose during prelanding tests of the shuttle's hydraulic system and steering rockets, which cause the craft to vibrate, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is most likely the culprit,'' Mr. Hale said at the news conference, holding up a plastic shim. ''It was there before; it's not there now. It was most likely shaken loose during the flight control system checkout. We probably will never know for sure.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has been particularly concerned about the shuttle's heat shield since a crack in the shuttle Columbia's protective skin caused it to disintegrate when returning from a mission in February 2003, killing the crew of seven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis's protective heat shield, which includes tiles on its bottom and hard composite material on its nose and the leading edges of the wings, had been inspected in detail twice before -- on Sept. 10, the day after it was launched, and again after it left the space station on Sunday -- and was declared to be in good shape for landing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, one of the astronauts spotted a second object floating by a window and photographed it. Mr. Hale said the second object appeared to be a torn piece of a plastic bag mistakenly left in the cargo bay before launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts on Wednesday spotted three other small bits of debris that they said looked like a piece of foil and two rings. Mr. Hale said that such so-called foreign object debris is not uncommon, but that NASA works to eliminate it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an earlier mission status briefing, Steve Stich, the entry flight director, said it was not unusual to see small bits of debris floating from the cargo bay. But he added that this usually occurred during the first day of a flight and not late in a mission. Because this is Atlantis's first flight in four years after a major overhaul, he continued, that might account for more bits of hidden debris working their way free.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis and its crew of six had been scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday after a successful mission to the International Space Station.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with poor landing weather predicted for Wednesday and concern that the unidentified object might be a critical piece of the Atlantis, N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, said mission supervisors ''decided we should delay de-orbit for a day and spend our time productively making sure we're comfortable with the status of the orbiter's heat shield in particular.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis's protective heat shield, which includes tiles on its bottom and hard, composite material on its nose and the leading edges of the wings, has been inspected in detail twice -- the day after its Sept. 9 launching and after the shuttle left the space station on Sunday -- and declared in good shape for landing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has been particularly cautious about the heat shield since a crack in the Columbia's protective skin caused it to disintegrate when returning from a mission in February 2003, killing seven astronauts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said the object was first spotted early Tuesday by a camera in the Atlantis cargo bay. Low-resolution images and a lack of data about it prevent engineers from determining the object's size, mass or exact shape, he said, making it hard to tell whether the item is critical to the shuttle or a sign of a threat. The pictures indicate a very small black object orbiting near the shuttle, Mr. Hale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could be a little something up close or a bigger something a little further away,'' he said. ''It's a bit of a mystery.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said engineers believed that the object came off the shuttle after a routine checkout of its flight control system before landing. In the tests, in which the craft's hydraulic flaps and control surfaces are moved and its steering rockets fired, the shuttle vibrates intensely and things can shake loose, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later Tuesday, an astronaut on the Atlantis spotted a second object floating by a window and photographed it. Mr. Hale told a televised news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston that the second object appeared to be a plastic bag mistakenly left in the cargo bay before launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see whether anything critical has been compromised, ground controllers used cameras in the cargo bay and on the shuttle's robot arm to survey the cargo hold and upper surfaces of the orbiter. Managers decided to have the crew use the 50-foot arm on Wednesday to examine the bottom of the shuttle. If observers spot something that requires further inspection, Mr. Hale said, astronauts could attach an extension to the arm and use another group of sensors for closer examination.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the shuttle passes inspection and the crew is not too tired, Mr. Hale said the Atlantis would be cleared to land in Florida on Thursday at 6:21 a.m. E.D.T. The craft has supplies to stay in orbit through Saturday.  </p>

Suffredini, the head of the station program, in a morning news briefing in Houston. The nature of the problem proved to be more slippery, but the astronauts -- Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia, Col.

Shortly after 7 a.m., Mr. Vinogradov noticed that the machine was overheating. He smelled a strong odor and saw a small amount of smoke, and turned off the oxygen generator, called the Elektron. The crew members also noticed a clear fluid that they suspected could be potassium hydroxide, a caustic chemical used in the Elektron.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission control in Houston then had the crew set off a fire alarm, which automatically shuts down ventilation between modules of the station and would keep toxins from spreading, and asked the crew to put on surgical masks, gloves and goggles in case the leaking chemical was potassium hydroxide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew was also instructed to insert a charcoal filter into the ventilation system to scrub unwanted chemicals from the air. They cleaned up the fluid and sealed it in airtight bags, and the station returned to normal operations within an hour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said that it was still not known whether the fluid was potassium hydroxide, but added that even if it were, it would not have posed a serious threat to the crew. A mission status report issued later in the day suggested that the stench and smoke might have come from a melting seal on the Elektron unit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elektron, a tank the size of a small water heater, recycles wastewater from the station into oxygen, which it circulates through the station, and hydrogen, which it vents into space. The machines have often been a source of trouble for the station's crews, and they have required regular maintenance and troubleshooting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes you have to work with it some,'' said James Hartsfield, a spokesman for the Johnson Space Center. ''It can be a sensitive piece of equipment.'' It had been turned off for nine days during the visit of the shuttle Atlantis, which has its own oxygen supplies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Elektron is malfunctioning, astronauts have alternate ways of replenishing the oxygen in the station's air: they can ''burn'' special oxygen-producing candles or tap the large oxygen storage tanks on board, with onboard stores to sustain three astronauts for months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At no time did NASA seriously consider having the crew enter the Soyuz capsule attached to the station to abandon ship, Mr. Suffredini said, adding that the decision to declare an emergency was meant to secure priority for flight controllers on communications links.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a later conversation with Russian mission control about the device, Mr. Vinogradov said: ''When I touched it, I thought, 'What's going on?' I thought the secondary purification unit was overheated, but why? I decided to turn it off.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian mission controller admitted to him, ''We were kind of nervous here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tense moments on board the station came at a busy time. The shuttle Atlantis departed on Sunday. Meanwhile, the next crew of the station -- Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, who will command the station, and a Russian cosmonaut, Mikhail Tyurin -- lifted off from the Russian launching facility in Kazakhstan on Monday morning, and will arrive at the station on Wednesday, bringing their passenger, Anousheh Ansari, a telecommunications entrepreneur who will be the fourth space tourist to visit the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station astronauts were also scheduled to release from the station a Russian Progress cargo ship filled with trash and unneeded equipment to make room for the approaching Soyuz; it will be sent toward Earth to burn up in the atmosphere.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overheating oxygen generation unit prompted the crew of the International Space Station to perform an emergency procedure on Monday. A stong odor, as well as small amounts of smoke and a fluid that might be a chemical irritant, were released by a melted rubber seal on the Elektron oxygen generator, in the Zvezda service module.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When two bolts slipped away from spacewalking astronauts last week, astronauts and controllers expressed concern that the small objects might have floated into the moving parts of the $372 million truss that had just been added to the station.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One astronaut, Joseph R. Tanner, sounding glum, described the trajectory of a lost bolt to mission control and fretted about its possible effects. ''I just hope that bolt is on its way to Mother Earth right now and not hanging around'' in the truss, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space junk is nothing new. During the first American spacewalk, in 1965, Edward White lost a glove -- though not one that he was wearing, fortunately. It was a spare that floated out of his Gemini capsule. NASA also had astronauts toss away a solar array for the Hubble Space Telescope during a mission in 1993. (As it drifted off, one exclaimed, ''It looks like a bird!'' )  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when a bolt is lost in space, should anyone care? Once analysts determined that the bolts had floated away, they dismissed the incident as trivial. But NASA also recognizes that the thousands of pieces of debris in orbit are potential hazards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concerns tend to focus on the risk of collision with objects moving at high speed, however; the relative velocity of something that has simply drifted away is low. Still, NASA mission planners require tethers for tools and objects during spacewalks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite those efforts, astronauts commonly lose small objects. During the last shuttle mission, Piers Sellers lost a spatula used to test repair techniques. ''It was my favorite spatula,'' he joked during the mission. John McCullough, the lead flight director for the station, said last week that on Russian spacewalks, ''they throw things away all the time.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two, Joseph R. Tanner, a former Navy pilot, and Cmdr. Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper of the Navy, spent 6 hours 41 minutes in space completing assorted tasks to get the station ready for further expansion as building of the research outpost resumed in earnest.  </p>

Shortly afterward, mission control sent commands to unfold the 1,600-pound radiator, and its seven panels expanded to form a 44-foot-long, 12-foot-wide winglike structure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radiator is to disperse heat and control temperatures of the electronics inside the solar array module once it starts supplying power to the station in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts also adjusted a communications antenna and swapped out defective parts, retrieved a suitcase-size experiment that exposed various materials to space to see how they fared, cleared the path of a mobile workstation that traverses the station, and rearranged footholds and handgrips for future spacewalkers working outside the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tanner and Commander Stefanyshyn-Piper conducted their first spacewalk on Tuesday, connecting the 17.5-ton truss structure that the space shuttle Atlantis attached to the station a day earlier. A spacewalk the next day by Cmdr. Daniel C. Burbank of the Coast Guard and Steven G. MacLean of the Canadian Space Agency continued installation of the $372 million addition and freed a big rotary joint that will allow the station's solar panels to track the sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overloaded circuit breaker delayed the final spacewalk of the shuttle's 11-day mission by 45 minutes because it knocked out a depressurization pump in the airlock where the astronauts were preparing for their excursion. The problem was caused by heaters cycling on at the same time as the pump and was corrected easily, said John McCullough, the lead station flight director.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With completion of the spacewalks, Mr. McCullough said, the busy mission was winding down. This is the first station construction mission since the 2003 Columbia disaster, which resulted in a nearly three-year grounding of the shuttle fleet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're all tired on this team, but happy,'' Mr. McCullough said at a news briefing from the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, the six Atlantis astronauts are to get a half-day off before packing up and preparing for the shuttle's departure on Sunday. The shuttle is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday.  </p>

He needled reporters, who have focused on problems like the two bolts that floated away from the construction work, and on another bolt that took the combined efforts of two astronauts to budge it, as well as a software problem that temporarily disabled one of the motors for the joint.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people have spent a lot of time talking about a couple of bolts,'' he said. ''If you told me before flight these are the only issues we'd have to deal with in the program, I would have taken that and run.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start of the panel-unfolding process, which was supposed to begin before midnight Wednesday, was delayed by a software glitch. By 5 a.m. Eastern time Thursday, the first set of panels began unfolding from their boxy containers. The array, 240 feet long, was stretched on command from the station, proceeding in stages to avoid a potential problem NASA called ''stiction,'' a portmanteau word that combined ''sticking'' and ''friction.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a similar set of panels was deployed in 2000, the array banged and flapped as it opened. This time, the panels were opened a little, then extended to 49 percent of their full length while the station aimed them toward the sun. They basked for 30 minutes in the warming rays before the process resumed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the first set of panels began to unfurl, some of them did stick together, but popped apart as the sun did its work, causing ripples in the structure but no concern on the ground. The two sets of panels were fully extended before 9 a.m.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris is the new permanent name for the solar body formerly known as Xena, while Pluto's new number reflects its loss of planetary status.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology who discovered the distant ball of ice and rock that he nicknamed Xena and that had been designated 2003 UB313, chose the name Eris, after the goddess of discord and strife in Greek mythology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is absolutely the perfect name,'' Dr. Brown said, given the continuing discord among astronomers and the public over whether Pluto should have retained its planetary status.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mythology, Eris ignited discord that led to the Trojan War.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She causes strife by causing arguments among men, by making them think their opinions are right and everyone else's is wrong,'' Dr. Brown said. ''It really is just perfect.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto, now that it is no longer a planet, has been assigned number 134340 in the catalog of minor planets. In 1999, the Minor Planet Center at the astronomical union proposed assigning Pluto the number 10000 in the same catalog, to give it dual citizenship as both a planet and a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris beyond Neptune. Brian Marsden, director of the center, said the number was meant as special recognition for Pluto, but he withdrew the idea after protests from people who saw it as a demotion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the discovery last year of Eris, which is slightly larger than Pluto and had been regarded by some as the solar system's 10th planet, led to the demotion and a minor-planet number after all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown had nicknamed the object Xena after the title character in the television series ''Xena: Warrior Princess'' and partly as a nod to Planet X, a massive planet long theorized to exist in the outer solar system. Eris now has the catalog number 136199.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Dr. Brown later discovered a moon around Xena, he nicknamed it Gabrielle, after Xena's sidekick on the television series. The moon is now officially named Dysnomia, after Eris's daughter, a daemon spirit of lawlessness. That name is also, in part, a nod to Xena fans. Xena was played by Lucy Lawless.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris is actually the second name that Dr. Brown proposed. Immediately after announcing the discovery in July 2005, Dr. Brown submitted to the astronomical union the name Lila, a Hindu concept that says the universe is a playground of the gods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name was also for his newborn daughter, Lilah.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is wider than Jupiter. But with half the mass, it is less dense than cork. In a cosmic bathtub, it would float.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers said they were baffled about how the planet formed and how it remained so puffy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The short answer is, I have no idea,'' said Dimitar Sasselov, a professor of astronomy at Harvard and a member of the research team. ''It's a very strange planet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, designated HAT-1-P, was found orbiting a star 450 light-years away in the constellation Lacerta. It is the second of its kind that has been located. The first was found circling the star HD 209458 in 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, astronomers speculated that perhaps an unusual event -- for example, that the star had somehow been knocked on its side, generating tidal forces that heat the interior -- led to its puffiness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the discovery of a second low-density planet, astronomers are wondering whether they are flukes or there is a whole class of puffy planets in the universe formed by a common process not yet understood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we have two of them, and we wonder if we should go back to the drawing board,'' said Robert W. Noyes, a senior astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., and another member of the research team.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal and were announced at a news conference at the Smithsonian Institution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An automated network of telescopes noticed that in the double-star system ADS 16402 in Lacerta, one star dimmed about 1.5 percent for two hours every four and a half days. The data suggested that something was periodically passing in front of it and blocking some light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers took a closer look with larger telescopes. They were also able to verify the presence of HAT-1-P by detecting four-and-a-half-day wobbles in the frequency of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of the planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many planets detected around other stars have been ''hot Jupiters,'' gas giants like Jupiter or larger, in very close orbits around the stars. The new planet falls into that category, circling at a distance one-twentieth that between Earth and the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are primarily hydrogen and helium, they also possess rocky cores and crushing pressures within that squeeze the hydrogen and helium to higher densities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jupiter's average density is 133 percent greater than of water. Saturn's is 70 percent that of water. The density of HAT-1-P is one-quarter that of water.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both Saturn and this planet would float on water, but this one would float a lot higher,'' Dr. Noyes said. ''The low densities would suggest very few rocks at the core.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astrophysicists now have two problems to solve: how a planet that has almost no elements heavier than hydrogen and helium can form and how it stays hot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our lack of understanding is worse than we thought it was,'' said Alan P. Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington who was not involved in the research.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost certainly, higher-than-expected temperatures within HAT-1-P cause the gases to expand and the planet to puff. Its diameter, 38 percent wider than Jupiter, is 24 percent bigger than theories predicted. HAT-1-P's proximity to the star is insufficient explanation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gas giants actually do pass through a puffy period in their youth when they are much hotter and then contract as they cool. Neither star, however, is young, and neither planet is likely to have formed recently.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From the point of view of planetary theory, they're in a region we would call Neverland,'' Dr. Sasselov said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Peter Pan, the two planets seem to have found a way to maintain their youthful appearance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea that Dr. Sasselov is exploring is that hydrogen and helium separate in a puffy planet, forming layers like oil on water. The energy from the heavier helium's falling to the center of the planet might be enough to explain the heating, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's an exotic scenario,'' Dr. Sasselov said. ''It's a possibility.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is that a second planet is pulling HAT-1-P into an eccentric orbit that would heat the interior through friction caused by the tides. That cannot be the case for the HD 209458 planet, however, because years of observations have shown the orbit to be almost circular.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sasselov said he thought it unlikely that the two large planets had been slammed in a way that tipped them on their sides, adding, ''It's like an impossible billiards ball hit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Strange New Planet''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smithsonian astronomers have discovered a new planet, designated HAT-P-1, in the distant constellation Lacerta. It is now the largest measured planet, although is has only half the mass of Jupiter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOST STAR: Slightly younger than Earth's Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW PLANET (HAT-P-1)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less dense than cork, the planet takes only 4.5 days to orbit its host star and orbits at 1/20th the distance of Earth from the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERCURY is the closest planet to the Sun, but is still 6 to 9 times farther from the Sun than HAT-P-1 is from its host star.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had plenty of excitement today,'' said John McCullough, the lead flight director for the station, in an afternoon briefing here at the Johnson Space Center. Despite what Mr. McCullough called ''numerous battles with the hardware,'' he said that ''we got all the activities done.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the spacewalk, mission controllers began putting a new rotating joint for the station through its paces, and the battles with the hardware continued. The mechanism will allow the 240-foot array of solar panels to face the sun continuously as the station circles the earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panels were scheduled to be extended beginning late Wednesday night, but mission controllers decided to delay that operation after problems developed in one of the two redundant motors that drive the joint.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the first motor was able to turn the truss 180 degrees, the second motor gave a signal that it was not properly engaged. Engineers worked on the problem into the night, and late in the evening NASA workers said they had resolved the issue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, it was the bolt problem providing all the drama. It was the third bolt to cause trouble for the crew of the shuttle Atlantis -- two others have floated away from the on-orbit construction workers and generated fretting about whether the bolts may get caught in the rotary joint or damage wiring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stuck bolt could have proved a more serious issue. It took the combined efforts of both spacewalkers, Cmdr. Daniel C. Burbank of the Coast Guard and Steven G. MacLean, heard grunting and groaning over their helmet microphones, to get the bolt to budge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts, both on their first spacewalk, got to work at 5:05 a.m. Eastern time, removing 20 restraints that had held the rotating joint in place for the heavy vibrations of launching. It was repetitive work: they removed 243 bolts in all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their work followed the spacewalk on Tuesday by Joseph R. Tanner and Cmdr. Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper of the Navy, who were so efficient that they were able to get a head start on Wednesday's tasks by removing two of the launching restraints.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ''get-ahead'' work led to the one stumble in that spacewalk, when the first bolt got away from Mr. Tanner. Analysts on the ground determined that the 1.5-inch bolt, spring and washer floated harmlessly away from the craft. About two hours into Wednesday's spacewalk, another bolt slipped away as Mr. MacLean worked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did not see the bolt go,'' he told mission controllers. Ground crews had Mr. MacLean search inside the structure for the bolt and washer, but decided that since insulation covers were in place, the bits of metal could not have floated into the structure, and had him move on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacLean struggled with the immobile bolt and broke an extension on a pistol-grip tool as he strained against it. Then Commander Burbank joined him to work a wrench with an extension to try to budge it. With both of them groaning against the wrench, Commander Burbank said, ''Oh, there goes!'' and they began the slow, arduous process of removal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Be careful with that -- where it breaks could be really bad,'' said Mr. Tanner, who was guiding the process from inside the shuttle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was concern that a stuck or sheared bolt could have meant that the restraint could not be removed and the rotating joint would remain locked. That, in turn, would have delayed deployment of the solar arrays. Or, as Mr. Burbank put it later, ''It would have been a showstopper for rotation and deploy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts cheered when they finally removed the bolt. Pam Melroy, the astronaut communicating with the shuttle from the ground, said, ''We appreciate your answering that age-old question'' for mission control, ''how many astronauts does it take to unscrew a bolt? And apparently it takes three -- two outside and one inside.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers worked well ahead of schedule until encountering the stuck bolt and were still able to take on a few tasks that would have been taken up Friday on the third spacewalk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the afternoon briefing, John Hainsley, the lead director for spacewalks on the mission, said the control team and the crew were mindful of the precise amount of force that the bolt could take without breaking and were careful not to exceed it.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen billion years ago, it was morning in the universe. Today, two independent teams of astronomers are reporting that they might be zeroing in on the time that bright galaxies began to light up the primordial universe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of galaxies, they say in two papers published today in Nature, seems to have sharply increased 700 million to 900 million years after the Big Bang. If true, the results could be a boon to theorists who would like to understand how galaxies formed and what stars they were made of.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results also lend support to the prevailing notion of galaxy formation. That theory holds that luminous galaxies were rare in early times and that they grew from the assembly of smaller building blocks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very exciting time,'' said Abraham Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not involved in the work. ''Advanced technology allows us for the first time to observe the opening chapter of 'genesis.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rychard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz, combed three years' worth of data from the Hubble Space Telescope and found a tenfold increase in the numbers of galaxies over the 200 million years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Illingworth said, ''The data demonstrate very clearly that there is quite a dramatic change in galaxy population over 200 million years.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The galaxies the researchers saw, he said, were one-tenth the size of the Milky Way, the solar system's galaxy, but just as bright, because they were ferociously forming new stars. He characterized those galaxies as ''the seeds'' of galaxies like ours or its neighbor in Andromeda.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another team, led by Masanori Iye of the National Astronomical Observatory in Tokyo, which has been using the giant Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, found a similar jump in galaxy counts in the same period. That includes what they say is the earliest galaxy yet confirmed, just 750 million years after the Big Bang, or equivalently 12.8 billion light-years from Earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers compute the distances of cosmic objects in space and time by measuring how much their light has been lengthened in wavelength, or ''red shifted,'' by their motion away from Earth because of the expansion of the universe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Iye and his colleagues used direct spectroscopic measurements of light emitted by hydrogen in the galaxy's starlight to do that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Illingworth and his colleague used an indirect technique, looking for the absorption of starlight by hydrogen, to derive distances and dates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The universe was, of course, born in light, 13.7 billion years ago in the standard Big Bang model. But after it had cooled for protons and electrons to combine into hydrogen atoms, the cosmos went cold and dark.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How the dark ages ended is a matter of hot debate. From 300 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, figures from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Satellite show that the hydrogen in space was reionized and split back into electrons and protons by radiation from stars or, perhaps, black holes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculations suggest that the first stars to form, out of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, would be 100 times as massive as the Sun and would rapidly explode, scattering heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and iron -- the stuff of planets and life -- into space to serve as material for a new generation of stars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stars forming in the newly discovered galaxies are probably of the second type, Dr. Illingworth said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Loeb said, ''It is not known which type of stars ionized the universe or when the transition between the two populations took place.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing data from surveys like the ones being reported with theoretical models could help resolve such questions, as well as sharpen theories of galaxy formation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., cautioned that it would take bigger telescopes and observations of even smaller objects to discern what occurred in the early universe. ''This is a good solid step,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''However, it doesn't come close to settling anything.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is the Japanese record likely to last long. Richard Ellis of the California Institute of Technology said in an e-mail message that he had used the Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea and a quirk of Einsteinian gravity to find protogalaxies even farther in the past, less than 500 million years after the Big Bang. These objects, too feeble and small for the Hubble to have seen them, have been amplified by the gravitational fields of intervening galaxies.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts, Joseph R. Tanner, a former Navy pilot and a veteran of three previous space flights and five spacewalks, and Cmdr. Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper of the Navy, on her first space flight, ventured into space and scrambled over the orbiting construction project at 5:17 a.m. Eastern time.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today, we showed I.S.S. assembly is back on track,'' John Shannon, the deputy manager of the shuttle program, said in a briefing. Before the spacewalk, Steven G. MacLean of the Canadian Space Agency maneuvered the $372 million solar array, which had been parked overnight near its final connection point. Automatic bolts then linked the truss and station.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You wouldn't think driving a bolt would be so exciting,'' Mr. Shireman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the structure attached, the spacewalkers left the airlock and began work on tasks they had trained for over the last four years. They were releasing the restraints that held elements of the truss tightly in place during the intense vibrations of launching, swinging the enormous boxes holding the furled solar arrays into operating positions and securing everything in the new positions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also connected 17 power, data and hydraulic cables that will take care of the most urgent need of the new equipment, providing power to the heaters that will keep the gear on the truss warm until the solar blankets can be deployed on Thursday to their full length -- 240 feet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk involved extraordinarily complex choreography, Mr. Shireman said. Ground controllers gave 1,631 commands to the crew during the spacewalk, when normally they would issue 200 commands in the same time, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work, which like much of the mission was broadcast live on NASA television ( www.nasa.gov/ntv [http://www.nasa.gov/ntv]), showed the two astronauts working with cool efficiency through the early morning hours, dwarfed by the station and upstaged by the wonders of the Earth rolling by below.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bantered along the way with Cmdr. Daniel C. Burbank of the Coast Guard, who is the shuttle astronaut choreographing the spacewalk in orbit. Sounding a little more like Bob Vila than Neil Armstrong, Mr. Tanner said at the end of one tightening operation: ''Think I'll put a few extra turns in there. Don't think anyone's going to mind. Just to make sure it's secure.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One mishap threatened to mar the spacewalk. A bolt, spring and washer slipped away from Mr. Tanner as he worked on the truss and tumbled across the structure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not a good thing,'' he said. ''Let's hope it doesn't end up somewhere in the mechanism.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The washer floated away harmlessly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission analysts then had to determine whether the spring and bolt posed a threat to jam moving parts or disrupt wiring. By the time the status briefing started at 1 p.m., however, managers had determined that the bolt, too, had drifted away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It didn't go inside,'' said John McCullough, the lead flight director for the station, explaining that the rotating joint was fully covered with protective panels. ''It's pretty trivial.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk on Wednesday promises another full day in space for the combined crews of the Atlantis and the station. Commander Burbank and Mr. MacLean will be outside and will remove more than 12 ''launch locks'' that restrain the new rotary joint. They will take other steps to prepare the new truss for unfurling the solar array.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the afternoon briefing, Mr. Shannon also said that mission team members had determined that there was no liftoff damage to the shuttle that should raise concerns about returning on Sept. 20.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the spacewalk ended, the astronauts sounded winded. Commander Stefanyshyn-Piper said, ''I'd just like to thank everyone for my first EVA,'' using the abbreviation for extravehicular activity. ''It was great.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Burbank responded, ''You were awesome, too!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the ground, Pam Melroy, the astronaut communicating with the crew, said: ''Joe and Heide, you did a phenomenal job. You set the bar very high for the rest of assembly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tanner, ever laconic, replied: ''We just did what we were told, Pam. That's all we wanted to do.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, Sept. 11 -- The shuttle Atlantis slid gently into place Monday morning at its destination, the International Space Station, clearing the way for construction of the station to begin again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 6:48 a.m. Eastern time, Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr. of the Navy, the mission commander, guided the shuttle at a measured one-tenth of a foot per second toward the station, delivering a 35,000-pound truss that will provide additional solar arrays for the half-built station.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation was completed 218 miles above the Pacific Ocean near Chile. An hour before, Captain Jett stopped the shuttle just 600 feet from the station and performed a delicate back flip that exposed the shuttle's belly to the station crew. That flip, known as a rotational pitch maneuver, allowed crew members to take detailed photographs that will be used to ensure that the shuttle's delicate heat shield made the trip into space without significant damage from launching debris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, chairman of the mission management team for orbital operations, said analysts had identified 495 ''regions of interest,'' a majority of which turned out to be marks and stains that existed before launching or were quickly shown to be of no concern. Also, three pieces of stiff cloth known as gap filler, which ride between insulating tiles to keep them from rubbing against each other when the shuttle flexes, have slipped out of place. Analysts are trying to determine whether they constitute any threat to re-entry, when the shuttle is surrounded by superheated plasma and tiny variations in the surface of the craft can disrupt the flow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Shannon said, the gap fillers appear so far to be well within the range that has been seen on previous flights without incident. Analysts poring over the data and images were so comfortable with the information in hand that they did not ask for additional inspections, which were an option in the mission schedule.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day's work did not end with the docking. The crews opened the hatches separating the shuttle and station at 8:30 a.m. and began removing the truss from the shuttle's payload bay using the shuttle's robotic arm, and passing the cargo to the station's arm. Since both arms are Canadian, Steven G. MacLean, an astronaut from the Canadian Space Agency, announced when he had completed the operation, ''There you have it -- the great Canadian handshake.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truss will sit parked next to the station overnight and will be joined to the station in the morning, when Joseph R. Tanner and Cmdr. Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper of the Navy will begin removing restraints and connecting power and data cables. To prepare for their spacewalk, Mr. Tanner and Commander Stefanyshyn-Piper are spending the night in the station's airlock at low atmospheric pressure to avoid the bends when they get into their low-pressure spacesuits. The procedure is called a camp-out, said Kirk Shireman, the deputy manager of the space station program, joking, ''There are no s'mores and fires involved.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shireman said each of three planned spacewalks presented complex and difficult tasks, adding that ''our folks are not going to rest easy'' until they actually see the solar panels unfurl on Thursday. The last time a similar set of panels was deployed, in 2000, there was a problem NASA referred to as ''stiction,'' which caused the array to bang and flap as it was opened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Agency has changed its procedures to avoid the problem, but it is still not certain that it will work. ''We've kept these things sealed in a box for four extra years,'' Mr. Shireman said, referring to the pause in construction after the Columbia disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such concerns, the mood at the Johnson Space Center here appeared to be a blend of relief and ebullience. After a Monday morning briefing, Paul Dye, the lead flight director for the mission, stood with reporters watching a television monitor as the shuttle's robot arm moved the enormous truss out of the payload bay, with less than four inches of clearance between the craft and the truss, as the Earth slid by below. ''We're up and clear,'' Mr. Dye exclaimed. ''Isn't that beautiful?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This particular operation was such a test of the shuttle arm operator's skill that NASA used the simulation as a generic training run. NASA has virtually removed the truss hundreds of times, Mr. Dye said. Visibly moved, he added, ''It's wonderful to see it actually happening for real.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd lie there looking and wondering,'' she said many years later. ''I was so young but so fascinated with space; it's always been in my heart.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the wonder of the girl is about to become reality for the woman, as Anousheh Ansari prepares to become the first woman to go into space as an amateur astronaut.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Mrs. Ansari and two professional astronauts are scheduled to blast off in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, part of a crew-exchange flight to the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iranian girl, now an American citizen and a wealthy entrepreneur, is to be the fourth private space explorer to buy a ticket to visit the station. (The price is undisclosed; Space Adventures, the company in Vienna, Va., that arranges the trips, is reported to charge up to $20 million each, most of it going to Russia's space program.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture into space was both expected and a surprise for Mrs. Ansari. She had been serving as backup to Daisuke Enomoto, a Japanese businessman who trained for months to be the next space tourist. But on Aug. 20, the Russian Space Agency announced that an undisclosed medical condition made him ineligible to go. So it became Mrs. Ansari's turn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis Tito, an American businessman, became the first amateur to visit the station in 2001, followed in 2002 by Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepreneur, and by the American scientist and businessman Gregory Olsen in 2005. In an interview, Mrs. Ansari, who turns 40 today, said she was sorry that Mr. Enomoto would miss this opportunity; they became friends during training. But she will readily seize this chance to venture into space. ''Space has always been part of my heart, and I will go with anyone who will fly me,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Ansari is used to being an exception. She relishes the idea of being a role model for other women who want to do the unexpected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She came to the United States with her family as a teenager, unable to speak English. She conquered that handicap swiftly, earning a bachelor's degree in electronics and computer engineering from George Mason University and a master's degree in electrical engineering from George Washington University. (She is pursuing another master's, in astronomy, from Swinburne University of Technology in Australia.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After college, she worked at MCI in the engineering division, where she met her husband, Hamid Ansari. In 1993, she persuaded him that they should leave MCI and start their own telecommunications company. That company, Telecom Technologies Inc., grew rapidly, earning several major technology patents; the Ansaris were able to sell it for hundreds of millions of dollars. The family later formed Prodea Systems Inc., a digital technology and investment company, in Plano, Tex., which is sponsoring Mrs. Ansari's spaceflight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Ansari's involvement in space is not new. In 2001, she and her brother-in-law, Amir, made a multimillion-dollar donation for naming rights to what became the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million award for the first private company to build a rocket capable of two manned suborbital flights in two weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aircraft designer Burt Rutan won the contest in 2004 with his SpaceShipOne. When Mr. Rutan announced he was joining with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Company to make a larger version for commercial suborbital flights by 2008, Mrs. Ansari was one of the first to reserve a seat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ansari family also signed an agreement this year with Space Adventures for Prodea Systems to be the financing partner in developing another vehicle to take up to five people on suborbital trips. The partnership has contracted with the Russian Space Agency to develop the spacecraft, named Explorer, said Eric Anderson, president of Space Adventures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Her interest is long-term, based upon a love of space that is deeply felt,'' said George Whitesides, executive director of the National Space Society, an advocacy group. ''She represents the potential of women if given the chance, and that includes being a pioneer for private spaceflight.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Ansari said she enjoyed her months of training at Star City in Russia and at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, including the difficult task of adding Russian to the three languages she already speaks, Farsi, French and English. Partly because of this effort, she dislikes being called a ''space tourist.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A tourist is someone who just buys a ticket and then goes somewhere,'' she said. ''They don't train for six months, including survival training in water and on land, and try to learn every system on a spacecraft.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked at a recent news conference in Star City why she wore an American and an Iranian flag on her spacesuit, Mrs. Ansari said she wanted to recognize both countries' contributions to her life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was born in Iran and lived there until the age of 16 and then moved to the United States,'' she said, according to wire service reports. ''So I have a lot of roots in Iran and feel very close to the Iranian people and the culture of the country.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Ansari said she had gotten many encouraging messages from around the world, including Iran, particularly from girls and women. ''I want to reach women and girls in remote parts of the world where women are not encouraged to go into science and technology jobs,'' she said, ''They should believe in what they want and pursue it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A guiding principle of her life, she said, is a quotation from Mahatma Gandhi: ''You must be the change you want to see in the world.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is what I am trying to do,'' Mrs. Ansari said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her last-minute selection means she will not be able to take along some private experiments she wanted to conduct during her eight days on the space station. But she said she would participate in some European Space Agency experiments aboard, take lots of pictures with a digital camera, and perhaps use a ham radio to talk to people around the world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have the coordinates of certain pictures I like taken from space, and I want to see those places in person,'' she said. ''And I want to see the place where I grew up in Iran, where I first looked up at the stars.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a quick vote last month, the International Astronomical Union decreed that Pluto was no longer the ninth planet, but just a dwarf planet -- and not even the largest dwarf -- orbiting in a distant ring of icy debris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps that should not be seen as a slight to Pluto.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many astronomers, that ring of icy debris, known as the Kuiper Belt, has become an exciting spot for innovative research and has changed how they view the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a lot bigger now,'' said Marc W. Buie, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. ''For me, it's like somebody invented a new field of science.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harold F. Levison of the space studies department in the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., said, ''The more we learn, the weirder it looks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 1,100 Kuiper Belt objects have been found so far. Astronomers estimate that half a million bodies larger than 20 miles wide are floating out there. At least one appears to be mostly rock with a coating of ice. Some are mostly ice. Some are less dense than ice, indicating a Swiss-cheese-like structure. A surprising number of them have moons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some move in clockwork with Neptune; Pluto, for example, is in what is called a 3:2 resonance, taking 1.5 times as long as Neptune to loop the Sun. Many Kuiper Belt objects have been flung into orbits crazily tilted to the rest of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really a very exotic zoo out there,'' said S. Alan Stern, executive director of the space science and engineering division at the Southwest Research Institute and principal investigator of NASA's New Horizon spacecraft, which is currently heading to Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distribution of Kuiper Belt objects has already provided decisive evidence that Neptune was once perhaps nearly a billion miles closer to the Sun and was then gravitationally nudged outward. Astronomers also hope that the Kuiper Belt preserves a frozen record of the earliest building materials of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of like the solar system's attic,'' Dr. Stern said. ''It's like an archaeological dig into the history of our solar system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists had initially expected a simple structure for the belt: a thin disk of objects traveling in circular orbits in the plane of the solar system. Some Kuiper Belt objects do fit that profile, and those are called the classical Kuiper Belt objects. (One mystery is why there appears to be a sharp edge at about 4.5 billion miles, with no classical Kuiper Belt objects beyond that distance. Some think a passing star did that.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Kuiper Belt objects share orbits similar to Pluto's, in resonance with Neptune. Those in the same 3:2 resonance as Pluto have been called the Plutinos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still others are called the scattered-disk Kuiper Belt objects. These appear to have been tossed into highly elliptical orbits, often at a sharp angle to the rest of the solar system. Surprisingly, these include some of the larger Kuiper Belt objects, including 2003 UB313, nicknamed Xena, which is larger than Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 15 percent of Kuiper Belt objects are binaries -- pairs of bodies of similar size and mass. Among some classical Kuiper Belt objects, that fraction may be as high as 30 percent -- possibly higher, because even the Hubble Space Telescope cannot distinguish two separate objects if they are too close to each other.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theorists puzzled about how such small bodies, with weak gravitational pull, could have paired up so often. The answer, it turns out, is that as two objects flew past each other, the gravitational drag generated by many other much smaller Kuiper Belt objects slowed them enough to capture each other.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mechanism requires a fairly dense Kuiper Belt with a total mass of at least 10 Earths. But while Kuiper Belt objects are many, they do not amount to much today. Adding the masses of Pluto, Xena and the half million other objects, even those not yet seen, gives an estimate of just one-tenth the mass of Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mass we measure is pathetic,'' said David C. Jewitt, a professor of astronomy at the University of Hawaii.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, in turn, produces a quandary. Where has 99 percent of the Kuiper Belt gone? This is, as the planetary scientists quaintly put it, the cleanup problem. (One popular idea: repeated collisions smashed most of them to dusty bits, and the bits were blown away by solar radiation.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 15 years ago, the Kuiper Belt was not on the map at all. The known solar system essentially ended at Neptune, except for the occasional comet interloper from far away. (Fifteen years ago, Pluto was traveling along the inner part of its eccentric orbit, closer to the Sun than Neptune.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard Kuiper, a prominent astronomer for whom the belt is named, speculated about the possibility of it in 1951. Kuiper was prescient, but wrong on a major point. He thought that the belt had existed early in the solar system's history but that Pluto, then thought to be a more massive planet, had scattered it away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people have suggested that the belt should instead be named after Kenneth Edgeworth, an Irish astronomer who vaguely hypothesized an icy disk a few years before Kuiper. But that was just a guess.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The outer solar system was just this sort of empty space,'' said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers did have a few clues that something was out there. One was Pluto, an oddball. Unlike the four rocky inner planets or the four outer gas giants, Pluto is half ice, and its orbit is quite elliptical and tilted 17 degrees to the solar system's ecliptic plane. It did not fit in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second clue showed up in 1977 with the discovery of Chiron, an icy body between 90 and 130 miles wide that loops around on an elliptical path taking it as close to the Sun as Saturn and as far out as Uranus. Astronomers argued over whether it should be called an asteroid or a comet. In the end, they decided both, and created a new category, Centaurs, to describe small bodies orbiting among the giant planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More interestingly, Chiron's orbit is unstable, meaning that within a million years or so, it will probably swing too close to Saturn and be tossed out of the solar system or onto a cometlike trajectory passing closer to the Sun. That also means that Chiron entered its current orbit in astronomically recent times. Like a lamb wandering the streets of Manhattan, it had to have come from somewhere else. No one knew where.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third, crucial clue came from comets. Some comets, known as long-period comets, visit the inner solar system once in thousands or millions of years, or simply once. Others like Halley's Comet are short-period comets that swing by more frequently, every few decades or centuries or so.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time, most astronomers theorized that short-period comets were long-period comets that had been deflected by the gravity of a planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, computer simulations by three Canadian astrophysicists -- Martin J. Duncan, Thomas R. Quinn and Scott Tremaine -- showed that the orbits of deflected long-period comets would not match those of observed short-period comets and that their more likely origin was a ring of debris by Neptune. Those computer simulations spurred several teams to start searching more actively the outskirts of Neptune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jewitt, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his graduate student Jane X. Luu had already started looking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our search was very simply motivated by the surprising emptiness at the edge of the solar system,'' Dr. Jewitt said. ''We would have been happy with either answer: empty because it was empty, or empty because no one had looked.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, they found nothing.To find moving objects requires taking repeated photographs of a region and looking for the points of light that moved between the images. The limits of digital technology stymied the early searches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, in 1992, they found 1992 QB1, probably about 100 miles wide, the first Kuiper Belt object.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown had a reaction similar to many astronomers. ''It's like, 'Oh my god, Pluto finally makes sense,' '' he said. ''It's no longer an oddball at the edge of the solar system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto was instead the harbinger of many properties now seen in Kuiper Belt objects: the resonant orbits, the moons, the icy ingredients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About that time, Renu Malhotra, a professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona, was calculating the effects of Neptune's migrating outward, as some had hypothesized, early in the history of the solar system. Her calculations indicated that Neptune would effectively snowplow smaller objects into resonant orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Kuiper Belt objects in resonant orbits were discovered in 1993. The distribution of resonant Kuiper Belt objects fit with what she predicted, and now planetary scientists uniformly agree that the giant planets were not born in their current orbits but migrated there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are looking for more clues about the early history of the solar system. Eugene Chiang, a professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, theorizes that the solar system used to contain several more gas giant planets that were subsequently ejected, but that their gravitational effects remain imprinted in the Kuiper Belt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levison of the Southwest Research Institute, however, offers a different account. He and his collaborators have created a model where the solar system was initially much more compact, with all the giant planets forming well within the current orbit of Uranus.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hypothesis sidesteps the cleanup problem, because shrinking the Kuiper Belt increases its density. His model predicts that gravitational wobbling between Jupiter and Saturn created wild oscillations in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus, with the two swapping places repeatedly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levison said he could not prove that his model was correct, just that it reproduces what is seen today in the solar system. And the Kuiper Belt was a key component in creating his model.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes how the blood is splattered on the wall tells you more about what happened than the body,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kuiper Belt, Dr. Levison said, is ''the blood splattering on the wall,'' adding, ''If we're going to understand what happened, it's going to be by studying the Kuiper Belt.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''An Expanding View of the Solar System''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Pluto looked like the oddball of the solar system, different than the rest. But in 1992, astronomers discovered that there is a large ring consisting of thousands of icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system. Pluto's demotion from planethood last month reflects the view of many astronomers that it is best seen as a member of this new neighborhood known as the Kuiper Belt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kuiper Belt objects  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most fall into three categories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Classical objects travel in almost circular orbits in a band beyond Neptune, with orbital periods between 200 and 400 years. For reasons not yet understood, the band ends sharply at 4.5 billion miles from the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resonant objects have been pushed by Neptune into special orbits which move in a repeating lockstep pattern with Neptune. Pluto and other ''Plutinos,'' for example, orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scattered objects have elliptical orbits that can extend beyond the reach of the classical Kuiper Belt objects. Their orbital periods can be longer than 1,000 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROUND, BUT NOT A PLANET  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sedna  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered in 2003, it is currently about 8.4 billion miles from the Sun. Amazingly, that is about as close as it gets to the Sun. At the other side of its 10,500-year orbit, it is about 90 billion miles from the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When first discovered by Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was thought to be much larger, about the size of Earth. It is now known to be just over 1,400 miles in diameter, or smaller than the Earth's moon, and has been reclassified as a ''dwarf planet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Xena'' (2003 UB313)  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis soared toward its rendezvous with the International Space Station on a mission to resume construction of the station for the first time since the Columbia disaster.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though analysis of the images and data from the launching and ascent were still being scrutinized, John Shannon, the chairman of the shuttle flight mission management team, said, ''Atlantis looks great.'' Mr. Shannon said the crew was as much as two hours ahead of schedule on its first-day tasks, which included a systematic scan of the nose cap and leading edges of the wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has made the detection of launching debris a high priority ever since an errant chunk of insulating foam caused the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from sensors and images of the ascent will be supplemented on Monday with a photographic scan of the shuttle by space station astronauts as the shuttle approaches and shows its belly in a back flip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission officials cited several glitches in the liftoff, which they characterized as minor. During ascent, one of four flight control channels for the rudder system, the speedbrake, was behaving differently from the others, a malfunction known as a ''force fight.'' Paul Dye, the lead flight director, said in a morning briefing that the erroneous messages from the single channel were overridden without incident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really not a big deal for one channel to be doing that,'' Mr. Dye said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several microswitches had also given incorrect readings once the shuttle was in space, Mr. Shannon said, but because Atlantis had not flown in four years, ''we expect to see those things.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the afternoon briefing, Mr. Shannon showed images of the foam loss from the shuttle's external tank. The foam appeared to have fallen from the tank after the shuttle climbed to an altitude in which the atmosphere was too thin to give the foam enough energy to strike the vehicle with the kind of force that causes damage, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Shireman, the deputy manager of the space station program, said the station crew was readying for the shuttle visit. ''It's like preparing your house for a bunch of relatives to come over who are also going to help you build the house while they're staying with you,'' Mr. Shireman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The morning packet of information and instructions that NASA sent up to the crew on Sunday included a parody board game comparing the Atlantis, which was delayed so many times since its initially scheduled launching date of Aug. 27, to a flightless bird, the penguin. The game squares detailed the incidents that caused delays, including lightning strikes at the launch pad, a sideswipe from Hurricane Ernesto, fuel cell problems and a failed fuel level sensor. The sixth and final square on the game read ''launch.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday will be an exceptionally busy day for the shuttle crew. Along with the rendezvous, the astronauts will be removing the enormous truss that they brought up to resume station construction and passing it over from the shuttle's robotic arm to the station's.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two weeks of postponements caused by bad weather and nagging mechanical problems, the Atlantis lifted off on time, at 11:14:55 a.m.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your long wait is over,'' Michael D. Leinbach, the NASA launch director, told the crew just before liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After achieving orbit, the shuttle opened its payload bay doors while its crew of five men and one woman began preparations for a Monday rendezvous with the space station. During an intense 11-day mission, the astronauts will resume construction of the station after a more than three-year hiatus that followed the loss of the shuttle Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary look at images from launching and ascent showed several incidents in which debris came off the external tank and may have struck the orbiter, said N. Wayne Hale, the shuttle program manager. However, Mr. Hale said, the earliest ''dribbly streams'' of debris occurred more than four minutes after liftoff, at a time when the air was so thin that the pieces posed little risk to the craft or crew. No damage has been detected so far, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is,'' he said, ''we are looking at nits, nothing of any remote consequence.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has closely monitored liftoff debris since the Columbia and its crew were lost in February 2003 in a disaster caused by foam falling from the fuel tank and punching a hole in the craft's heat shield. The space agency spent more than two years redesigning the tank to prevent most such debris shedding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fuel tank sensor that forced postponement of Atlantis' launching attempt on Friday appeared to work normally during early morning fueling of the 500,000-gallon tank holding propellant for the shuttle's three main engines. Since Aug. 27, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had been trying to launch Atlantis on its mission to resume construction of the space station since. A lightning strike on the launching pad, a looming tropical storm and equipment problems with a shuttle power generator and the fuel sensor forced repeated delays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you saw today was a flawless count, a majestic launch, and it was tough to get here,'' the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said at a news conference about an hour after liftoff. ''Not everything in the count leading up to this day was easy. And in between we had to dodge tropical storms, lightning strikes and things like that. But we got here and it was just a flawless day.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle had to be launched this weekend to avoid interfering with a planned Russian launch of a Soyuz spacecraft carrying a new crew to the space station on Sept. 18, and the return of the laboratory's crew to earth on Sept. 29. A delay would have forced NASA to wait until at least the end of September to try again.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort on Saturday, scheduled for 11:14 a.m., will be the shuttle's last chance before the end of the month to lift off for an 11-day mission to resume construction of the International Space Station.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather forecasters said conditions at the Kennedy Space Center here should be very good on Saturday morning, with only a slight chance of showers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sensor problem that interrupted Friday's countdown, just 45 minutes before liftoff, was a familiar one. The shuttle Discovery's mission in July 2005 -- the first since the 2003 Columbia disaster -- was delayed two weeks while engineers swapped fuel tanks and wrestled with a faulty sensor. Since then, NASA has been using newer versions of the sensors and putting them under closer scrutiny for flaws.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Friday morning, an engine cutoff sensor inside the giant external tank failed a routine test as technicians loaded more than 500,000 pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The sensor is one of four in the liquid hydrogen section of the tank that monitor the level of fuel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the fuel tanks were to run unexpectedly low during ascent, the sensors would set off a controlled shutdown of the engines so they did not run on empty, which could result in a disastrous explosion. Malfunctioning sensors could also cause the engines to cut off prematurely, endangering the chance to reach orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA rules state that if a single cutoff sensor fails, engineers need to drain the fuel tank and verify that all the sensors are working as they go dry. If the other sensors and system work as expected then or during refueling, the Atlantis could be cleared to launch with three of four working sensors on Saturday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel very good that we really need only three of those engine sensors to work,'' N. Wayne Hale Jr., the director of the shuttle program, said at a news conference. ''If everything is performing as expected and we just have one sensor that continues to be a bad actor, we'll launch tomorrow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Atlantis misses this last launching opportunity, it will have to wait until at least late September or early October for another chance, and that would require changing a requirement for daylight launchings. After the Columbia disaster, NASA was required to limit launchings to daytime so photographs could be taken of potentially damaging debris from the external fuel tank, the type that damaged and doomed the Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any launching after Saturday and before the end of the month would conflict with Russia's plan to launch a Soyuz spacecraft on Sept. 18 to carry a new crew to the space station and to return the laboratory's departing crew on Sept. 29.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian and American space officials have agreed that if the Atlantis launches on Saturday, it must leave the station on the day of the Soyuz launching instead of the day before, as had previously been planned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of the half-built space station stopped when shuttles were grounded because of the Columbia accident. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is eager to resume building the orbiting outpost by having the Atlantis take up a 30,000-pound girder section that includes a new set of solar power arrays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Friday's problem with the fuel tank sensor, the flight of the Atlantis had been delayed for nearly two weeks by a lightning bolt that struck the launching pad; by Tropical Storm Ernesto; and by an erratic electrical reading in one of three fuel cells that produces electricity and water for shuttles in flight.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept. 7 -- NASA will try to launch the space shuttle Atlantis on Friday, confident that a problem seen in an electrical generator presents a ''minimum risk,'' space agency officials said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration postponed a launching attempt on Wednesday because of an erratic reading from a pump that chills one of the shuttle's three fuel cells, which generate electricity. After a detailed study of the readings, engineers determined that the fuel cell was ''probably acceptable to fly with'' and should not curtail the mission, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., shuttle program director.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large majority of the managers polled at an afternoon meeting on the launching attempt voted to try on Friday, Mr. Hale said, with the only objections based on issues other than safety. The Office of Safety and Mission Assurance at the agency voted for replacing the unit and flying later to ensure that the goals of the mission were achieved, not because of safety concerns, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said the agency was not bowing to schedule pressure and a closing launching window in pressing ahead. Safety was the primary concern, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have stood down two days to make sure we are safe to fly,'' he said at an evening news conference at the Kennedy Space Center here. ''We have gone the extra mile.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis and its crew of six are scheduled to take off at 11:41 a.m. on an 11-day mission to resume construction on the International Space Station. If problems prevent liftoff then, NASA will get a final try on Saturday at 11:15 a.m., the end of the launching window for September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather forecasters said conditions should be good for a launching on Friday and even better on Saturday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle must take off by this weekend to avoid a conflict with the scheduled Russian launching of a Soyuz spacecraft that will carry a new crew to the space station on Sept. 18, and return the laboratory's departing crew to Earth on Sept. 29.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager, said he had spoken with the Russians about avoiding a conflict in the flights. If the Atlantis lifted off on Saturday, it would need to undock from the station on the day of the Soyuz launching instead of the day before, as had been planned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale said launching at the end of the window would not require the Atlantis to cut its mission short or curtail any of its planned tasks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency is eager to resume station construction, which has been suspended for almost four years because of the 2003 Columbia accident, which grounded the shuttle fleet. The Atlantis is carrying a $372 million, 30,000-pound, bus-size segment of the station's backbone that includes a new set of solar power arrays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the busy mission, the shuttle's crew is supposed to conduct three complicated spacewalks to attach the segment and deploy the solar arrays. The next half-dozen shuttle missions to the station are intended to complete a structure that will hold the station's four main power arrays and a complex wiring and plumbing system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency plans to undertake 16 shuttle missions to complete the assembly of the half-finished space station by 2010, when the three-shuttle fleet is set to retire.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While only one fuel cell is required for a shuttle to operate, NASA rules call for all three units to be working for the shuttle to take off. If one of the units fails in flight, however, the rules call for ending the mission and returning home early.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Replacing the fuel cell could have delayed any launching attempt by several weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Poulos, manager of shuttle orbiter projects, said that the unit was working and that replacing it would increase the chance of creating new problems. The unit is safe to use, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our risk really is going to be minimal,'' Mr. Poulos said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuel cell problems have affected several shuttle missions, NASA officials said. In 1995, the launching of the Endeavour was delayed eight days so workers could remove and replace a bad fuel cell. A 1997 flight of the Columbia returned to Earth four days after launching when a cell failed. That cell showed erratic readings before taking off, but the Columbia was cleared to fly.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept. 6 -- ''Superstitions? What's that all about?'' NASA's shuttle launch director, Michael D. Leinbach, asked in an interview this week. ''I am not a superstitious person.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If not, he is one of the few. The space program is rife with rituals, charms, lucky numbers and other defenses against bad karma -- not just disaster, but the mechanical and weather problems that have postponed the Atlantis liftoff.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a custom that dates from the first shuttle mission in 1981, shuttle crews will not leave the suit-up room until the commander loses in a card game. They repeatedly draw poker hands until the commander ends up with the lowest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some managers insist on wearing special clothes. During the Apollo era, the Lunar Orbiter program manager, Lee R. Scherer, always wore the same sport coat, said Hugh W. Harris, a retired public affairs chief at the Kennedy Space Center here. When the program ended, Mr. Scherer shredded the coat and distributed pieces among co-workers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerology is also important. Space shuttle missions were numbered as STS-1, STS-2 and so on, for Space Transportation System. Then NASA turned the consecutive identification system into an awkward combination of numbers and letters that included even the fiscal year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whether that was superstition, you really can't say, but somehow they avoided STS-13,'' Mr. Harris said, laughing. (NASA has since gone back to straightforward numbering.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted that three astronauts aboard the International Space Station are the 13th team of permanent residents, and NASA officially refers to them as the Expedition 13 crew. As they launched a Soyuz capsule on March 30, television showed a dangling toy white bear, a lucky charm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is hardly the only superstition at work in Russia and the Baikonur Cosmodrome. In keeping with a custom almost half a century old, the wives of Russian astronauts do not attend launchings. Nor do the crews watch their Soyuz spacecraft roll to the pad two days before liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian astronauts have another ritual: urinating against a tire of the bus taking them to the launching pad. They are commemorating the first man in space, Yuri A. Gagarin, by replicating his urgent deed before his launching in 1961.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An odder ceremony took place before Titan rocket missions back in the 60's. Members of the launching team would meet the night before liftoff, and the youngest would bury a knife in the sand, aimed in the same direction as the flight path.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the space center here, some controllers pick a different place to park the day after a liftoff is scrubbed. Not Mr. Leinbach, the launch director -- he has a reserved spot. ''So I park in the same spot all the time,'' he said with a laugh. ''I don't have to worry about that.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During her six-month stay on the International Space Station in 2002, Peggy Whitson, a NASA astronaut and biochemist, lived in a constant state of free fall. The station's fast orbit of Earth -- at 17,500 miles per hour -- put everything and everyone into a weightless state, making life interesting, to say the least.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Dr. Whitson vacuumed, she floated after motes of lint, droplets of spilled water and slivers that escaped when she cut the hair of her Russian crewmates.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she slept, she ''loosely bungeed'' herself to the wall and actually slept quite well, she says, which astronauts often have trouble doing in space. In the laboratory, where she worked for five to six hours most days, she had to keep careful track of her instruments. ''Investigators get very creative with the kits they build,'' she said. ''Lots of Velcro, elastic and gray tape also works wonders.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mixing solutions presents another challenge. ''No pouring allowed in space,'' she said. ''Without gravity you can get balls of liquid, which I scientifically tested by extruding lemonade from a drink bag.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson shared these insights via phone and e-mail from Star City, Russia, just outside Moscow, where she is training as the backup commander for the next space station expedition. Two of its crew members are due to leave for the station on a Russian Soyuz transport vehicle from Kazakhstan on Sept. 14. While the chances are slim that Dr. Whitson will go up this time, she is scheduled to be the commander on the station for six months or longer starting in September 2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson set a little-known milestone in 2002 when she became the first science officer to inhabit the International Space Station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is as modest about this achievement as she is about her many awards and honors. She rushes to talk about the scientists who followed her to the station -- two chemical engineers, Don Pettit and Leroy Chaio, and three physicists, Ed Lu, Mike Foale and John Phillips -- who, she says, ''really are whizzes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think my talent, if I have any, is perseverance,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the International Space Station began its long-term housing of astronauts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in November 2000, only 6 of the 33 astronauts have been research scientists. More commonly, astronauts have a military background, with degrees in engineering.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others at NASA describe Dr. Whitson, 46, as perfect for a job that requires self-direction along with agile hands to perform many experiments on a tight timeline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think of Peggy as being gifted in everything -- not only in space and life sciences, but also in operations, from robotics to space walking,'' said Kent Rominger, chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who would believe, Dr. Whitson asks, that a girl from a hog and soybean farm in Iowa would become an astronaut? She decided that was her calling at age 9 after watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon. Her father, a farmer who flew for fun, took her flying a year later. Their flight over the cornfields served as further inspiration, but her ambitions blazed in her senior year of high school when she heard that NASA had chosen the first women to become astronauts -- among them, Sally Ride and Shannon Lucid.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson graduated second in her class, having taken every science class that Mt. Ayr Community High School offered. By then she had her sights set on being a scientist as well as an astronaut.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew that was possible because of Shannon Lucid,'' a biochemist, Dr. Whitson said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others tried to talk her out of her dream.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she was graduating from Iowa Wesleyan College in 1981 -- summa cum laude, earning degrees in biology and chemistry in three years -- two advisers urged her to go to medical school. The physicist James Van Allen, a noted Iowa Wesleyan graduate who helped design the country's first orbiting research satellite, also tried to dissuade her from pursuing a career in space. Dr. Van Allen, a promoter of unmanned space vehicles, said, Dr. Whitson recalled: ''Oh, in 10 years or so they won't need astronauts. It's not a worthy profession to pursue.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Whitson was not deterred. ''In my usual way, I didn't pay any attention,'' she said. ''I still wanted to be an astronaut.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She chose to do her doctoral work in biochemistry at Rice University in Houston because it was next to the Johnson Space Center, where she hoped to work some day. In 1986, both the Salk Institute in San Diego and the Johnson Space Center opened their doors to her as a postdoctoral fellow. She stayed in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, she joined NASA as a biochemist involved primarily with the planning and execution of space-oriented experiments. In the 1990's, she was the project scientist for the Shuttle-Mir Program, a precursor for the International Space Station; the deputy division chief of the Medical Sciences Division at NASA; and a co-chairwoman of the United States Russian Mission Science Working Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every year for 10 years, she doggedly applied to NASA's astronaut program. In 1996, she was accepted and began the training that led to her 2002 trip to the space station. Those six months in space were so fulfilling, she said, that ''leaving the station was extremely difficult.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the mission, Dr. Whitson conducted 21 investigations. ''I was lucky during the last expedition to have done a really wide variety of experiments,'' she said. They included studying how semiconductor metals produce larger crystals in microgravity, which make for better conductors, and growing soybeans to see if microgravity causes changes in their genes. Such plant experiments, Dr. Whitson said, could help future astronauts grow food on lengthy space trips and enhance the understanding of plant growth on Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In microgravity, molecules spread out, making them easier to study. Similarly, when Dr. Whitson first went into orbit, her spinal column expanded, causing her lower back pain for the first few days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, because of budget constraints, astronaut scientists are more narrowly focused on minimizing the risks of long-term space travel in anticipation of flights to the Moon and Mars, Dr. Whitson said. They are studying ways to stop bone loss, for example, and keep the immune and cardiovascular systems healthy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to criticism that the space station's science program has fallen short of its goals, Dr. Whitson says the fact that any science is being done on a 400,000-pound structure orbiting 220 miles above Earth is ''miraculous.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the biggest experiment is finding out, can we really build something this big? If we go to the Moon or Mars, what are our limitations?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for the 2007 mission, under her watch, include installing solar wings that will provide electricity for two new science modules housing European and Japanese laboratories. As construction of the station continues, crew members will be up against their hardest tasks, NASA says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is never going to be no risk,'' Dr. Whitson said, recalling the disintegration of the space shuttle Columbia in February 2003, three months after her return to Earth. ''The thing that catches us next time will be something different. That's part of the game we play. But everything we do is worth the risk, because it's one more step of exploration.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept. 2 -- Four days after evacuating the Kennedy Space Center as Tropical Storm Ernesto approached, the six crew members of the space shuttle Atlantis flew back to Florida on Saturday to prepare for a launching on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the crew left in training jets last Tuesday for a trip to Houston, they watched from the air as the space shuttle crawled off the launching pad on a journey to an assembly building for shelter, said Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr., the shuttle commander.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midway through the shuttle's four-mile journey, managers with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided to return it to the launching pad once the storm's intensity had been downgraded. The decision gave NASA an opportunity to launch on Wednesday, rather than several weeks later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think all of us thought we were going to be spending a little while in Houston,'' Captain Jett said Saturday after returning to the Kennedy Space Center. ''I think we're all really happy that just four days later we're back here and we have a shot at this launch window.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the storm reached the Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday night, it had been downgraded to a tropical depression, and peak gusts at the launching pad were at 44 miles an hour, well below the 79 m.p.h. threshold that requires the shuttle to be moved indoors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers inspecting the Atlantis the next day found three areas of minor foam damage on its external fuel tank: a three-eighths-inch cut in the middle of the liquid oxygen tank, a one-inch scratch near where the tank connects to the solid rocket boosters, and a missing lump of foam from the liquid hydrogen barrel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first two scratches were expected to be repaired easily, and the missing foam will not need to be replaced, NASA officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any kind of foam insulation problem on the external tank is a major concern for NASA engineers. Foam falling off the space shuttle Columbia's external tank during liftoff in 2003 struck the spacecraft's wing, allowing fiery gases to penetrate and kill its seven crew members while it was returning to Earth. Since then, NASA has redesigned the external tank to minimize foam shedding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis will deliver a 35,000-pound, $372 million addition to the half-built International Space Station during the 11-day mission. Four astronauts will take three spacewalks to resume the station's construction, which was stopped after the Columbia accident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA and its international partners hope to finish the space station during 14 other shuttle missions by 2010, when the cargo-carrying vehicles are scheduled to be retired.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis was originally to have been launched last Sunday. Liftoff was delayed after lightning struck the launching pad, requiring engineers to check out Atlantis's systems.  </p>

Two scientists have been forced to resign from NASA's Advisory Council, the agency's top advisory group, and a third has resigned without being asked to. The merits of the struggle are hard for outsiders to assess, but the passions unleashed in recent weeks may bode ill for the sound planning of space research in the future.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggle comes at a time when unmanned scientific missions, after many years of substantial growth, have been reined in because of NASA's need to spend large sums on resurrecting the shuttle program, completing the space station and developing a spacecraft to replace the ailing shuttles. As Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, sees it, too many scientists are unwilling to accept that reality and end up offering advice that falls beyond the priorities set by the president and Congress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some dissenting scientists respond that they are not trying to subvert political priorities but are mostly concerned that Mr. Griffin has done away with a longstanding advisory structure in which panels of scientists fed their suggestions directly to administrators responsible for research programs. Now such suggestions must be sent up through the advisory council chairman and then to Mr. Griffin and back down to the responsible official, with plenty of room for dilution on the way. The process is far less effective than direct contact, they complain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the administrator has every right to set up whatever process that best meets his needs. In a rebuke to council members, Mr. Griffin charged that by ''effectiveness'' the scientific community really means ''the extent to which we are able to get NASA to do what we want them to do.'' He considers it an obvious conflict of interest when scientists whose work is largely financed by NASA expect to have a big role in prescribing what work NASA should do.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, he is not eliminating any conflict that may exist, but merely channeling it through the advisory council. The main advantage he gets is a chance to see the advice before it funnels into the bureaucracy below him, where it might undercut his own plans for the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the public needs from all this is some assurance that once the passions have subsided, Mr. Griffin will look closely at whether he is losing anything valuable through his streamlining of the advisory structure. And the scientific community will scout around for alternate means to make its voice heard if it feels cut out at NASA.   </p>

It was North American Aviation, which was later acquired by Boeing, not McDonnell, which also became part of Boeing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Sep 02 2006   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 -- Lockheed Martin won a multibillion-dollar contract from NASA on Thursday to build the nation's next spaceship for human flight, a craft called Orion that is to replace the space shuttle and eventually carry astronauts to the moon and beyond.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much-awaited announcement was a major victory for Lockheed and a startling setback for its rival, a joint venture of Boeing and Northrop Grumman.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the announcement, many analysts had said the deal was the Boeing team's to lose. A leader in building unmanned rockets and spacecraft, Lockheed has little experience with human spaceflight; by contrast, Northrop, Boeing and their subsidiaries built not only the space shuttle fleet but the Apollo vehicles that took men to the moon in the 1960's and 70's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a late-afternoon news conference to announce the decision, NASA was tight-lipped about the reasons, saying the details of the two competing bids were ''proprietary.'' Doug Cooke, a deputy associate administrator who led the selection team, said both proposals ''were sound and carefully prepared.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooke said the Lockheed Martin design looked ''achievable,'' an indication that it relied more heavily on known technologies than developing new ones. ''This is a design that is based on known capabilities,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA decision is likely to change the dynamics of the space business, setting Lockheed up to be the dominant player in space exploration and perhaps forcing Boeing to rethink its role.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For both companies, this was a make-it-or-break-it award to stay in the manned space business,'' said Brett Lambert, managing director of the Densmore Group, an aerospace consulting firm, adding, ''This decision defines who will continue to be a major player in space for the next 10 years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan calls for building a space capsule with an emergency escape tower similar to the Apollo capsule that ferried men to and from the moon. Orion, though, would be much larger than Apollo. The NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, who did not speak at the news conference, has called the new ship ''Apollo on steroids.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orion is to carry up to six astronauts to the International Space Station; a later version would take four astronauts to the moon, where they would use a separate lander ship to reach the surface. Still later versions could serve as crew-return vehicles for ships that one day may take humans to Mars, NASA officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle fleet is to be retired in 2010. Orion is to make its first human flight by 2014, but at Congress's urging NASA hopes to fly at least a year earlier to minimize a gap in the nation's ability to send people into space. The agency is also developing new booster rockets, based on space shuttle technology, to launch Orion and cargo to the moon. The rocket to launch Orion is set to make its first flight in 2009.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Orion contract calls for Lockheed Martin to get $3.9 billion through 2013 for designing, developing, testing and evaluating the new craft and building two for initial flights into space. A second stage, from 2009 to 2019, provides $3.5 billion for building an unspecified number of manned ships to go to the space station and the moon, and some cargo-only versions for supplying the station. The contract also includes $750 million for engineering work to modify or improve the ships.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts say that these numbers are conservative and that NASA projects typically run 50 percent above initial estimates, in part because there is little incentive to stay within budget once a contract has been awarded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard McCurdy, a space policy expert at American University in Washington, said that once Boeing's subsidiary Rockwell got the contract to build the space shuttle, ''they had NASA over a barrel -- they were like a monopoly supplier.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle program is estimated to have cost around $10 billion since it began in the 1980's. No price tag has been announced for the Bush administration's plan for manned exploration of the moon and Mars, but estimates have run above $200 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be the first time that Lockheed has been given a lead role in manned space flight. It comes after the company failed in a 1996 attempt to design the X-33 space plane, which was to be a replacement for the quarter-century-old shuttle fleet but was abandoned because of technical problems after NASA spent more than $900 million on it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Underwood, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin Space Systems, said that even her company would not know the exact reasons for its selection ''until each team is debriefed by NASA in a week or two.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said Lockheed had been the only maker of capsule systems used by NASA since the Apollo program, from the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970's to those of the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are still gathering information on Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are the capsule company,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big loser on Thursday was Boeing, which has stumbled in its space business lately. Its entry into the commercial space launching business came as commercial demand for satellites began to fall. Its spy satellite program was so plagued with problems that the Pentagon took it away from Boeing and gave it to Lockheed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, it was a major contractor for the International Space Station, which has suffered from enormous cost overruns. Its engineers were blamed, in part, for the problems that led to the Columbia shuttle disaster in 2003, and the United States Air Force recently withheld $1 billion of rocket launching contracts from Boeing after it was found that company employees had stolen proprietary documents from Lockheed to compete for Air Force rocket business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A victory yesterday would have been a signal that Boeing had turned the corner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Boeing, it would have been a real vote of confidence in their ability to manage a major program,'' said John Pike, director of Global Security.org, an aerospace research company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanya Deason-Sharpe, a Boeing spokeswoman, said that while Boeing was disappointed, it would compete for other manned space vehicle contracts, including the Ares I rocket that will launch Orion into space and the Ares V cargo launcher, also part of the program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Boeing is bigger than any single contract win or loss,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blow to Northrop and Boeing is softened by the prospect of additional work as subcontractors to Lockheed or in other parts of the program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lockheed plans to spread out the work on the program in a number of locations where NASA already has a strong economic and political presence. Work is expected to be done in Houston, where Lockheed estimates that 1,200 new jobs will be created; in Denver, with 500 new jobs; in Florida, with 300; and at the Michoud plant in New Orleans, with 200.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement was welcomed by members of Congress from those regions. Representative Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, called it ''great news for Colorado'' and ''a boon to Colorado's aerospace industry, which is third in the nation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Lockheed and Boeing were the big competitors on this contract, they are partners on other government space contracts. Both are partners in United Space Alliance, a joint venture that provides support services for the shuttle. In addition, Boeing and Lockheed have formed another venture, United Launch Alliance, to jointly provide Air Force rocket launchings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin, the NASA administrator, who has been a forceful presence in the space shuttle fleet's return to orbit after the Columbia disaster, stayed in the background at Thursday's news conference. A spokesman said that the announcement spoke for itself and that Mr. Griffin did not take part because his presence would have been a distraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Back to the Moon''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lockheed Martin Corporation will build Orion, the spacecraft that will succeed the space shuttle as NASA's primary vehicle for human space exploration. Its first flight is planned for no later than 2014. Its first flight to the moon is planned for no later than 2020. Below, the crew vehicle.

That definition demoted Pluto, leaving the solar system with eight planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The petition states: ''We, as planetary scientists and astronomers, do not agree with the I.A.U.'s definition of a planet, nor will we use it. A better definition is needed.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark V. Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and S. Alan Stern, of the Space Science and Engineering Division of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., organized the petition. Many planetary scientists, they said, were dissatisfied with the new definition, some because of how it was decided, some because they did not find it sound.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signers of the petition included NASA scientists, astronomers at major observatories, university professors and graduate students.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomical union allowed only scientists attending a conference last week in Prague to vote.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's definition for a planet specifies three conditions: the object orbits the Sun, it is large enough for its gravity to pull it into a round shape, and it ''has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last condition excludes Pluto because it is located among many other icy bodies in a ring of debris known as the Kuiper Belt. But it strikes some scientists as imprecise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Earth has not cleared out all of the asteroids that cross its path. Even Jupiter, the largest planet, has not entirely cleared out its neighborhood; asteroids known as the Trojans share its orbit.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 -- The space shuttle Atlantis was on the way back to its hangar at Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Tuesday afternoon, facing a delay that would have probably have set back its mission by more than a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the weather improved.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the threat from Tropical Storm Ernesto diminished, NASA managers reversed themselves -- and the crawler vehicle that was hauling the Atlantis -- and ordered the spacecraft back to its launching pad.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reversal means that the mission, to install important additions to the International Space Station, may be able to start as early as Sept. 6.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, N. Wayne Hale Jr., the manager of the shuttle program, said the space agency might relax a rule, imposed in the wake of the Columbia disaster, that sharply restricts the dates when the Atlantis can lift off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launchings must take place when there is sunlight both at Cape Canaveral and thousands of miles into the flight, when the external fuel tank is jettisoned, so both shuttle and tank can be photographed for possible liftoff debris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the current window of time, that leaves just a few days before the end of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The requirement applies to only the first three post-Columbia flights -- the two by the Discovery last year and last month, and the Atlantis's coming mission. It is this rule that Mr. Hale said the agency would now review.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, NASA is talking with the Russian space agency about another possible extension in the current launching window.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Atlantis could lift off as late as Sept. 13 based on lighting alone, any effort after Sept. 7 would require the Russians to delay a mission of their own: that of a Soyuz rocket carrying the next crew for the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LeRoy Cain, another shuttle manager, said the two space agencies were talking about adding Sept. 8 as a launching day for the Atlantis, but the status of those discussions is unknown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cain said the decision on Tuesday to keep the shuttle on the launching pad had essentially been made before the order was given to roll back to the hangar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revised forecasts early Tuesday indicated that by the time the storm reached the Kennedy Space Center, its winds would be within NASA limits for keeping a shuttle on the launching pad, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to be cautious, he said, managers decided to start the transporter toward the hangar while weather forecasters reviewed later data. Once satisfied that the Atlantis could ride out the storm on the launching pad, managers ordered the transporter to reverse course.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on the pad, the shuttle is to be secured and shielded to ride out the storm. The space center was ordered closed by midnight Wednesday, with only a small ''ride out'' crew left to secure the base, but workers are to return Thursday to inspect damage and resume flight preparations, NASA said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before today, shuttles have rolled back from the pad 16 times, 4 because of severe weather. But Tuesday's move set a precedent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the first time that we have reversed course on a rollback,'' said Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight of the Atlantis and its crew of six, originally set to begin last Sunday, was delayed twice before to examine potential damage from a lightning strike on the launching pad last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle managers had said earlier that it would take eight days to prepare the Atlantis for another launching attempt if it rolled back to the hangar. But Mr. Leinbach said Tuesday that the reversal would shorten that preparation time, since much normal preflight work had already been done.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would delay the shuttle's mission to the International Space Station -- already postponed twice -- for at least a week.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.2-mile trip to the hangar is to begin Tuesday morning, but there is a slim chance that the shuttle will remain on the launching pad if the storm diminishes significantly. If that happens, the mission could begin as early as Sunday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA managers emphasized on Monday that a rollback was likely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clear in our minds that we are rolling back unless something real extraordinary happens,'' Michael D. Leinbach, the shuttle launching director, said at a news conference. ''We wish we weren't in this situation, but we are.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liftoff of the Atlantis and its crew of six, delayed over the weekend to examine the launching pad for damage after a lightning strike last week, had been set for 3:42 p.m. on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the approaching storm forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to speed up plans to move the shuttle back into the shelter of the giant Vehicle Assembly Building. NASA is so anxious to resume space station construction that technicians had continued preparing for liftoff while simultaneously planning a rollback.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It became clear early Monday that the tropical storm, which could restrengthen to a hurricane, was swinging toward central Florida and the space center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathy Winters, the shuttle weather officer, said Monday morning that the National Hurricane Center forecast put the storm's track within 15 miles of the Kennedy center by Wednesday evening. ''We're even more concerned about Ernesto now,'' Ms. Winters said at the news conference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rollback procedure involves draining the shuttle's power-producing fuel cells of volatile liquid hydrogen and oxygen and then disconnecting explosive bolts and other connectors before moving the spacecraft onto a giant mobile transporter. The shuttle would be exposed to the elements during the six-hour journey from pad to hangar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach said engineers hoped to start Tuesday morning instead of Tuesday afternoon, as first planned, because the storm was coming closer than predicted earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching times are governed by restrictions imposed after the loss of the Columbia in February 2003. Shuttles must lift off in a window of time when there is enough daylight to photograph both the launching in Florida and the jettisoning of the external fuel tank into the Indian Ocean, on the other side of the world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current case, the window closes Sept. 13.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has been planning to launch a Soyuz rocket carrying the space station's next crew, and any Atlantis liftoff after Sept. 7 would force a delay in that mission. Later dates would require a riskier night return by the Soyuz rocket, a step the Russians oppose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LeRoy Cain, NASA's launch integration manager, said NASA officials were holding discussions with the Russians on options to extend the window for launching the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has flown only two shuttle flights since the Columbia disaster, testing new safety modifications and procedures. The agency is anxious to resume space station construction and wants to fly three shuttle missions before the end of the year to maintain a schedule to finish the station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-day Atlantis mission is a critical step in completing the space station. The mission's goal is to deliver a 17.5-ton truss segment and a new solar power array to the space station, a complex assembly task requiring three spacewalks to complete. Each construction mission is essential to the one that follows and must be completed in sequence to finish the orbiting research outpost.  </p>

But as Tropical Storm Ernesto veered toward the western Florida coast, pushing winds and clouds ahead of it that would affect the east coast of the state and the Kennedy Space Center by midweek, workers started battening down rocket launching facilities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really haven't lost our minds,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, said of the competing activities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA wants to resume space station construction to try out new safety modifications and procedures, after making only two shuttle test flights since the 2003 Columbia disaster. The agency wants to fly three times before the end of the year to maintain a schedule to finish the station before the shuttle fleet retires in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have two competing objectives,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said at a news conference. ''One, we want to get the vehicle ready to fly. The other objective is we want to get the vehicle ready to roll back. They are not compatible. At some point in the sequence you have to give up one or the other.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, NASA postponed the planned Sunday launching of Atlantis by one day to examine the effects of a large lightning strike on the launching pad in a storm on Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle was not hit, but engineers were concerned about potential damage from a surge of electricity around the shuttle and associated ground equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, managers pushed the next chance for a launching to Tuesday at 3:42 p.m. to give them more time to assess what impact the lightning might have had, if any.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said that the shuttle and its external tank had essentially been cleared for flight, but that engineers were still looking at data to see if explosive bolts connected to the craft's large booster rocket might have been affected by a surge of current.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If managers decide to move the shuttle back to the hangar, technicians will first have to drain onboard oxygen and hydrogen supplies that power the vehicle's fuel cells and make other critical preparations. The entire rollback process from the launching pad to the hangar takes about 48 hours, officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its 11-day mission to the space station, Atlantis is to deliver a truss segment and a new solar power array, a complex assembly task requiring three spacewalks to complete.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said a large lightning strike at the launching pad during a storm on Friday afternoon initially appeared to cause no damage.

The strike, carrying a current of about 100,000 amperes, struck a lightning rod atop the gantry around the shuttle and might have been the largest bolt ever to have struck a launching pad at the center, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials emphasized that the shuttle itself was not hit by the lightning but that they were concerned about damage that might have been caused by the surge of electricity around the shuttle and its associated ground equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did see a couple of indicators that make us want to look at the ground systems and the flight systems of the vehicle to make sure we don't have any problems when we fly,'' Mr. Cain said at a news briefing.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching of Atlantis and its crew of six is now set for 4:04 p.m. Monday, officials said, assuming that engineers can finish their tests and analysis in time. The goal of the mission is to deliver a truss segment and new solar power array to the space station, a complex assembly task requiring three space walks.  </p>

They predicted great things for their astrological charts as Xena's orbit was plotted in ensuing years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last week, when the International Astronomical Union announced at a meeting in Prague that Pluto had been demoted to dwarf status and that by the group's new calculations the solar system no longer contained even 9 planets, much less 10, astrologers said it wouldn't make any difference.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pluto gets no respect, man,'' Mr. Neal, 23, said. ''I mean, I took an astronomy class in college, and I still don't know anything about it.''   </p>

Indeed, across the country, and presumably the universe, the news that Pluto was no longer considered a full planet was met with a mix of surprise and shrugs, even as people struggled to eulogize a cosmic entity that most know very little about except its size (small), its distance from Earth (great) and its weather (terrible).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main effect, in fact, seemed to be to mystify further a populace that already seemed almost universally confused about the former planet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think its probably a star,'' said Nick Sbicca, 22, who was visiting the Exploratorium, the children's science center, on Thursday. ''I really don't know. But I think there's definitely more than eight planets.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least there were, before Pluto was demoted on Thursday to ''dwarf planet'' status by a vote of the International Astronomical Union in Prague, in part because of a wonky orbit that periodically swerves into that of Neptune.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of which mattered to fans of Pluto, many of whom, like the ex-planet itself, were little.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like Pluto,'' said Ashleigh Sundquist, 8, who was at the Exploratorium. ''Nobody lives there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That opinion was seconded by Kristen Young, 9, of Chicago, whose knowledge of Pluto was roughly that of many adults.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's cold,'' she said. ''And it's small. And you can't go on it because it has gas.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the elders of the third planet from the Sun, of course, there were some practical concerns. The World Book Encyclopedia had been holding the presses for its 2007 edition until Pluto's status could be clarified. With the fall semester looming, some school districts were already looking at updating their science textbooks, and even planetarium staffs had started rethinking planetary models.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I woke up this morning, and there was one less planet,'' said Al Whitaker, a spokesman for the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. ''But I understand that Pluto wants a recount.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other groups were defiant, including the American Federation of Astrologers, which said the astronomers' decision would have no effect on their charting of futures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't really matter what you call it,'' the president of the group, Patricia Hardin, said from her home in Knoxville, Tenn. ''As far as I'm concerned, Pluto is still an effective energy source that's influence is felt on this earth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, some people also asked the existential questions that the cosmos typically inspires. Why did this happen? What does it mean? And, of course, how does this effect Mickey Mouse's dog?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the announcement from the astronomical union, Disney executives were peppered with questions about whether Pluto's planetary status would affect Mickey's sidekick. The answer was no.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's taking the news in stride,'' said Lisa Haines, a spokeswoman for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at Disney, though, it seemed that people were distancing the cosmic outcast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pluto was not necessarily named after Pluto the planet,'' Ms. Haines said. ''We've got absolutely nothing on record that even draws a connection between the two. And we're certainly not changing Pluto's name.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back at Pluto's, the sandwich shop here, another stargazer, Chris McGrew, said he was not surprised by the news.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just the natural progression of things,'' Mr. McGrew said. ''The more you learn, the more assumptions are going to get turned upside down. It's just part of science. And life.''   </p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of wrangling and a week of debate, astronomers voted for a sweeping reclassification of the solar system. In what many of them described as a triumph of science over sentiment, Pluto was demoted to the status of a ''dwarf planet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new solar system as defined by the International Astronomical Union, meeting in Prague, there are eight planets instead of nine, at least three dwarf planets and tens of thousands of so-called smaller solar system bodies, like comets and most asteroids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the other dwarf planets are Ceres, the largest asteroid, and an object known as 2003 UB 313, nicknamed Xena, that is larger than Pluto and, like it, orbits beyond Neptune in a zone of icy debris known as the Kuiper Belt. But there are dozens more potential dwarf planets known in that zone, planetary scientists say, and so the number in the category could quickly swell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nod to Pluto's fans, the astronomers declared it to be the prototype for a new category of such ''trans-Neptunian'' objects, but declined in a close vote to approve the name ''plutonians'' for them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outcome yesterday completed a stunning turnaround from only a week ago, when the assembled astronomers were presented a proposal that would have increased the number of planets in the solar system to 12, retaining Pluto and adding Ceres, Xena and even Pluto's moon Charon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reversal, said Dr. Alan P. Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, speaks to the integrity of the planet defining process.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The officers were willing to change their resolution,'' Dr. Boss said, ''and find something that would stand up under the highest scientific scrutiny and be approved.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay M. Pasachoff, a Williams College astronomer who attended the Prague congress and favored somehow keeping Pluto a planet, said, ''The spirit of the meeting was of future discovery and activity in science rather than any respect for the past.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who discovered UB 313 three years ago and so had the most to lose personally from the downgrading of Pluto and Xena, said he was relieved.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Through this whole crazy circuslike procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on,'' Dr. Brown said. ''It's been a long time coming. Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are involved.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had long been clear that Pluto, discovered in 1930, stood apart from the previously discovered planets. Not only is it much smaller -- only about 1,600 miles in diameter, smaller than the Moon -- but its elongated orbit is tilted with respect to the other planets, and it goes inside the orbit of Neptune on part of its 248-year journey around the Sun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto, some astronomers had argued, made a better match with the other ice balls that have since been discovered in the dark realms beyond Neptune. In 2000, when the Rose Center for Earth and Space opened at the American Museum of Natural History, Pluto was denoted in a display as a Kuiper Belt object and not a planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the decision yesterday as to what constitutes a planet, astronomers voted by standing and holding up yellow cards. In the crucial vote, the result was sufficiently one-sided that no formal count was taken.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new rules, a planet must meet three criteria: it must orbit the Sun, it must be big enough for gravity to squash it into a round ball, and it must have cleared other things out of the way in its orbital neighborhood. The last of these criteria knocks out Pluto and Xena, which orbit among the icy wrecks of the Kuiper Belt, and Ceres, which is in the asteroid belt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dwarf planets, on the other hand, need only orbit the Sun and be round.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this is something we can all get used to as we find more Pluto-like objects in the outer solar system,'' Dr. Pasachoff said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final voting was by some 400 to 500 of the 2,400 astronomers who registered for the congress; many others had already left.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pointing to the very small fraction of the world's astronomers who had been in Prague and thus eligible to vote, Alan Stern, lead investigator for New Horizons, NASA's mission to Pluto, called the resolution ''laughable.'' Dr. Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., pointed out that both Earth and Jupiter have asteroids in their neighborhoods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is so scientifically sloppy and internally inconsistent,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''that it is embarrassing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time that astronomers have rethought a planet. The asteroid Ceres was hailed as the eighth planet when it was discovered in 1801 by Giovanni Piazzi, floating between Mars and Jupiter. But the subsequent discovery of more and more things like it in the same part of space led astronomers to dub them asteroids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many astronomers watched the vote on the Internet, Neil deGrasse Tyson of the Rose Center said he had not bothered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Counting planets is not an interesting exercise to me,'' Dr. Tyson said. ''I'm happy however they choose to define it. It doesn't really make any difference to me.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far more compelling, he added, are aspects of planets like weather, ring systems and magnetic fields.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson said a continuing preoccupation with what the public and schoolchildren would think about this was a concern and a troubling precedent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know any other science that says about its frontier, 'I wonder what the public thinks,' '' he said. ''The frontier should move in whatever way it needs to move.''  </p>

It was a welcome step away from a proposal that would have kept Pluto as a planet but simultaneously opened the door for dozens of small, icy bodies on the fringes of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crucial vote came after tumultuous debate at a meeting of the International Astronomical Union, which had been considering a proposal to define a planet as any object that orbits a star and is large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That definition was scientifically precise but led to results that offended common sense. An asteroid, a small moon, and another icy ball like Pluto would suddenly have been catapulted to planet-hood, swelling the number of planets to 12, with hordes more icy rocks likely to qualify as more was learned about them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the astronomers have now added another requirement to the definition. Planets must not only be large enough to be round, they must also have cleared out the neighborhood around their orbits. Pluto would not qualify -- it orbits in a belt of icy debris on the edge of the solar system. Neither would an icy rock nicknamed Xena, which orbits in that same zone, nor Ceres, a big asteroid that marches in the company of other asteroids. Pluto's moon, Charon, which had qualified under the first proposal, is also out of the running.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto, with its small size and oddball orbit, should never have been deemed a planet in the first place. Henceforth there will be eight planets, at least three dwarf planets, and tens of thousands of ''smaller solar system bodies,'' like comets and asteroids. Our only regret is that the astronomers chose the name ''dwarf planets'' for Pluto's new category instead of abandoning the word entirely when discussing these less-than-planetary bodies.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that today can go down as the 'day we lost Pluto,' '' said Jay Pasachoff of Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., in an e-mail message from Prague.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under fire from other astronomers and the public, a committee appointed by the International Astronomical Union revised and then revised again a definition proposed last week that would have expanded the number of official planets to 12, locking in Pluto as well as the newly discovered Xena in the outer solar system, as well as the asteroid Ceres and Pluto's moon Charon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new definition offered yesterday would set up a three-tiered classification scheme with eight ''planets''; a group of ''dwarf planets'' that would include Pluto, Ceres, Xena and many other icy balls in the outer solar system; and thousands of ''smaller solar system bodies,'' like comets and asteroids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line, said the Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich, chairman of the Planet Definition Committee of the union, is that in the new definition, ''Pluto is not a planet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's not happiness all around, believe me,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new proposal was hashed out in a couple of open meetings, the first of which was described by participants as tumultuous, and the second as more congenial. Astronomers are supposed to vote Thursday on this or some other definition, but whether or not a consensus is emerging depends on whom you ask. Some astronomers expressed anger that the original definition of a planet had been developed in isolation and then dropped on them only a week before the big vote. Others continued to question whether it was so important to decide the question now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its defects, some astronomers say, the newer definition abandons any pretense of being applicable to planetary systems beyond our own solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many astronomers, Pluto's tiny size and unusually tilted orbit make it a better match to the icy balls floating in the outskirts of the solar system in what is known as the Kuiper Belt than to the traditional planets like Jupiter and Mars. The issue has been forced on astronomers by the discovery of such a ball even larger than Pluto, nicknamed Xena by its discoverer, Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Pluto is a planet, Xena should be, too, Dr. Brown has argued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee's original prime criterion was roundness, meaning that a planet had to be big enough so that gravity would overcome internal forces and squash it into a roughly spherical shape. But a large contingent of astronomers, led by Julio Fernandez of the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay, has argued that a planet must also be massive enough to clear other objects out of its orbital zone. Dr. Gingerich admitted, ''They are in control of things.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the newest resolution includes the requirement for orbital dominance as a condition for full-fledged planethood, Dr. Gingerich said. That knocks out Pluto, which crosses the orbit of Neptune; Xena, which orbits among the icy wrecks of the Kuiper Belt, and Ceres, which is in the asteroid belt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vociferous objectors have said they could accept this,'' Dr. Gingerich said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reached in his office at Caltech, Dr. Brown, who as the discoverer of Xena has the most to lose by its and Pluto's demotion, said he thought he could live with the new proposal. ''It essentially demotes Pluto to something other than a real planet, which is reasonable,'' he wrote in an e-mail message.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gingerich cautioned that there were still many things to be sorted out. For example, the I.A.U. may or may not create a special name for Pluto and other dwarf planets, like Xena and others yet to be discovered, that dwell beyond Neptune. If so, he said that ''plutonians'' seemed a likelier choice than the previous suggestion ''plutons.'' That term was protested by geologists, who pointed out that it was already used in earth science for nuggets of molten rock that have solidified and reached the surface.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two more days before the scheduled vote, there was no guarantee that Pluto would not make a comeback and that the definition of planethood might be rewritten again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people think that the astronomers will look stupid if we can't agree on a definition or if we don't even know what a planet is,'' said Dr. Pasachoff of Williams College. ''But someone pointed out that this definition will hold for all time and that it is more important to get it right.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I went to bed disconsolate, being the curator of cosmic affairs in the household, that my daughter was going to wake up to an incomplete solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a poignant predicament for a science reporter. Pluto's status has been controversial for years. Several astronomers have argued that its tiny size and elongated and inclined orbit make it a better match with the ice balls wandering beyond Neptune in the so-called Kuiper Belt than with the other planets -- never mind the placemats, textbooks, the schoolroom charts and, yes, the planet mobiles. As of this writing, they are still arguing and if Pluto survives as a planet, it could be with an asterisk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week a committee appointed by the International Astronomical Union proposed a new, scientific definition of a planet, namely anything that is round, circles a star and is not itself a star.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That turned out to include, once you read the fine print, not just Pluto and Xena, which is slightly larger and farther out, but also the asteroid Ceres (once briefly called the eighth planet) and Pluto's moon Charon, bumping the number of planets to 12.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently I'm not the only one scratching my head. It just seems a little wacky that Pluto's satellite gets to join the club, but not bigger and more interesting bodies like Titan and Europa, both mentioned as possible abodes of life, or our own Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology and discoverer of Xena, says that more than 40 other objects fit the new planet criteria, which he described last week as a ''No Ice Ball Left Behind'' policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are already inventing mnemonics to help them remember the names of the new planets, like this one from David Sturm, a physicist at the University of Maine: ''My Very Excellent Mother Could Just Serve Us Nuts, Pizza, Carrots 'n' Xylophones!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, some geologists are upset about the use of the word ''pluton'' to describe Pluto-like planets in the new scheme. In geology plutons are chunks of molten rock that solidify underground and then emerge on the surface, emissaries, if you will, from the underworld.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What happens when we find a pluton on a pluton?'' asked Allen F. Glazner of the University of North Carolina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In e-mail messages from Prague, Owen Gingerich, chairman of the union's Planet Definition Committee, said, ''It was only accidental that Pluto remained a planet'' in their proposal. Nor had they tried to calculate how many new planets would result.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the group will be offering a new proposal, taking orbital dynamics as well as roundness into account. ''The eight classical planets will still be central to the meaning of planet, and the other round nonsatellite objects will all be dwarf planets,'' he wrote, ''but there will still be a special category for which Pluto is the prototype.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A committee member, Richard Binzel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would not reveal details of the proposal before the discussion today, but he said, ''We're going in the direction of categories of planets.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final vote is Thursday and I have no idea what will happen today, let alone then. But I know how I feel about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the committee has fallen into a trap, trying too hard to come up with a scientific answer to a problem that is not scientific. I don't hear geologists getting in a dither about the difference between a hill and a mountain, or arguing about what qualifies as a continent -- why Europe but not India? Why Australia but not Greenland? That hasn't stopped them from making progress on plate tectonics, nor has Pluto's ambiguity stopped planetary science from forging ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Pluto were discovered today, nobody would have any trouble assigning it to minor league status, with Xena and the other ice balls. But it was not, and we have 76 years of tradition to deal with. One can't help but remember the ballyhooed but futile effort 30 years ago to switch to the metric system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so long ago, the astronomy magazine Sky &amp; Telescope sponsored a big contest to find a more dignified name for the Big Bang, the putative creation event, only to announce at the end that every alternative was worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would serve us Plutophiles right if Dr. Gingerich and his colleagues had hatched this scheme just to teach us a lesson.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's hard to tamper with tradition and with placemats. After all, the planets aren't just named, they're hopelessly anthropomorphized, named for Gods, with personalities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, unlike subatomic particles, the planets are out there for all of us to see. Anybody can learn to follow them around in the sky. Einstein's theory of general relativity would not have had nearly the emotional impact that it did in 1919 if not for the dramatic verification during an eclipse that year that the stars themselves could appear knocked askew in the sky by the Sun's gravity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sky is our oldest symbol of order and regularity in nature. Mess with it at your own peril.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have done my bit to put the solar system in order. After a careful search in the light of day I found Pluto hanging by a thread on the side of a toy shopping cart. I rehung it and then taped down the hangers for the rest of the planets. My daughter's solar system is done. It won't come apart again. But I might be able to hang a little Xena off one end.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The flights ahead will be the most complex and challenging we've ever carried out for construction of the International Space Station in orbit,'' said Michael Suffredini, the station program manager at NASA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has allotted about 15 flights to complete the project before the shuttles are retired in 2010. The next four missions will carry other massive truss segments to extend the station's central girder to more than 350 feet. The girder will eventually support four huge sets of solar-power arrays, batteries and heat-dispensing radiators.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The additional truss segments, which will increase the mass of the station by 40 tons, will also include 10-foot-wide rotary joints shaped like wagon wheels that will allow the solar arrays to track the sun for optimum power as the station moves in orbit. The Atlantis is delivering the second array, joining one put on the station in 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The assembly of the station on these flights has no parallel in space history,'' Mr. Suffredini said. ''We have planned, studied and trained for these missions for years. We know they will be hard, and we may encounter the unexpected. But we are eager to get started.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work on the station stopped because of the Columbia accident, which forced NASA to redesign many shuttle systems and its own safety procedures. The Columbia disintegrated while returning from a mission on Feb. 1, 2003, killing its crew of seven. The shuttle had been critically damaged during liftoff when a piece of insulating foam broke off its fuel tank and ruptured part of its heat shield.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery, equipped with modifications and flying under new safety guidelines, made two flights to test the changes. Worrisome amounts of foam were shed during the first liftoff, a year ago, and still more changes were ordered; a detailed inspection during the second mission, last month, showed far less debris.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers say shuttle flights should still be considered experimental and somewhat dangerous, but they call the risks ''acceptable'' for the missions left to finish the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect to have some foam loss from the tank on the next flight,'' said N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program. But a better understanding of these issues, and progress in developing ways to repair damage in flight, allow NASA to resume a regular launching schedule, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We now feel we are ready to go back into assembly operations,'' Mr. Hale said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis's mission, which will last about 11 days, will be an exhausting one for its six-member crew.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've never had to fit so many activities back to back on consecutive days,'' said Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr. of the Navy, the mission commander and a veteran of three shuttle flights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once in orbit, the crew will spend a full day inspecting the shuttle's heat shield with a Canadian-built robot arm and an attached 50-foot boom tipped with a camera and sensors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the shuttle approaches the space station for docking the next day, Captain Jett will stop it about 600 feet away and execute a pitch maneuver that will rotate the orbiter nose-up, allowing the station crew to take detailed photographs of the shuttle's underbelly. Then he and the pilot, Christopher J. Ferguson, another Navy captain who is on his first mission, will dock with the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After greeting the station's three-member crew, the Atlantis astronauts will almost immediately use the shuttle and station robot arms to remove the $371.8 million truss segment from the orbiter's cargo bay and make an initial attachment. NASA normally waits a day after a docking to transfer such cargo, but it wants to make sure the girder is delivered in case the shuttle has to make an emergency departure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two teams will conduct the spacewalks on the next two days to secure the truss and prepare for deploying the solar array. Joseph R. Tanner, a former Navy pilot and a veteran of three space flights and five spacewalks, will be joined by Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper, a Navy commander on her first space flight, for the initial excursion to connect power cables and free parts that were bolted down for launching.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, Daniel C. Burbank, a Coast Guard commander, and Steven G. MacLean of the Canadian Space Agency, both veterans of a shuttle mission, are to conduct their first spacewalk as they prepare the solar panel rotary joint for activation. The solar array will be deployed on the sixth day of the mission, followed the next day by another spacewalk by Mr. Tanner and Commander Stefanyshyn-Piper to deploy a cooling radiator, install joint braces and retrieve a case of scientific experiments left outside the station.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station's crew members are Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia, Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army and Thomas Reiter of Germany.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulling off so many complicated tasks so quickly will require unusual coordination among the spacewalkers, the astronauts aboard the station and shuttle, and the flight controllers and engineers on Earth, said Phil Engelauf, NASA's lead flight director.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are extremely intense, extremely tightly choreographed missions,'' he said, ''probably more so than we've done in the past.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: Col. Jeffrey N. Williams, a space station crew member shown on an excursion this month, will have a busy week with the Atlantis astronauts. (Photo by NASA)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''Expansion''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week, assembly is to resume on the International Space Station for the first time since late 2002. Astronauts aboard the shuttle Atlantis will deliver and install a 17.5-ton truss section and additional solar arrays.   </p>

Engineers suspect that two of the bolts are too short on the antenna. The Atlantis has flown with those bolts without trouble since they were first installed two decades ago. The problem was discovered last week, and NASA officials will probably not decide until this weekend whether to leave them or change them in a tricky maneuver at the launching pad.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel appointed by the International Astronomical Union thinks it has come up with a dandy compromise to the years-long struggle over whether we should continue to count Pluto as a planet. The trouble is, the new definition of a planet would include an awful melange of icy rocks found on the outer fringes of the solar system. It would be far better to expel Pluto from the planetary ranks altogether, leaving us to bask in the comfortable presence of the eight classical planets that were discovered before 1900 and have excited wonder ever since.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto, discovered in 1930, never deserved to be called a planet. It is far smaller than first thought, smaller in fact than our own moon. Its orbit is more elliptical and tilted in a different plane than those of the other planets, and its icy, rocky body is more like a comet's core. If Pluto were discovered today, it seems highly unlikely that anyone would consider it a planet. But Pluto has emotional partisans who resent anyone picking on the puniest planet, so efforts to demote it invariably meet resistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a panel of astronomers and historians has come up with a new definition of the word ''planet'' that would keep Pluto in the club. Under the new definition, a planet would be any celestial body that orbits around a star and is large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. That definition would produce an ugly porridge of 12 old and new planets, with dozens more on the way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceres, heretofore considered the largest of the asteroids, would qualify. The panel suggests that people might want to call it a ''dwarf planet,'' raising the question of why bother to call it a planet at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pluto would still count as a planet but would be shunted into a new category called ''Plutons,'' which would include any object that meets the definition and has an orbit beyond Neptune's. Two other bodies already qualify as plutons, namely Charon, which had been considered a moon of Pluto, and a recently discovered ice ball somewhat bigger than Pluto. Many dozens of distant ice balls may ultimately qualify for planethood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this just to keep Pluto as a planet. Whatever merit the new definition may have scientifically, it is an abomination culturally. When the astronomical union votes on the matter next week, it ought to reject the new definition and summon the courage to scratch Pluto from the list of planets.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the hope of ending years of wrangling, a committee of astronomers and historians has proposed a new definition of the word ''planet'' that would expand at a stroke the family of planets from 9 to 12 and leave textbooks and charts in thousands of classrooms out of date.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But astronomers immediately began to wrangle about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a mess,'' said Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the chosen few within the solar system would be not only Pluto, whose status has been challenged in recent years, but also Ceres, the largest asteroid; 2003 UB313, nicknamed Xena, an object discovered by Dr. Brown in 2005 orbiting far beyond Pluto in the outer solar system; and even Pluto's largest moon, Charon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, at least a dozen more solar system objects are waiting in the wings for more data to see if they fit the new definition of planethood, which is that an object be massive enough that gravity has formed it into a sphere and that it circles a star and not some other planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The definition, they said, would apply both inside and outside the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new definition was to be announced today in Prague, where some 2,500 astronomers are meeting in the triannual assembly of the International Astronomical Union. It is the work of the group's Planet Definition Committee, whose chairman is Owen Gingerich, a Harvard astronomer. The astronomers will vote on the definition on Aug. 25.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Dr. Gingerich said this might not be the last word on what a planet is. ''Science is an active enterprise,'' he said, ''constantly bringing new surprises.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it was no surprise that as word of the decision leaked out yesterday, reaction from astronomers suggested that the argument was far from over.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will be the talk of the town in Prague,'' said Alan P. Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who said the new definition, with four paragraphs and four footnotes, read as if it had been written by lawyers, not scientists. ''I don't think this is the one were looking for.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, which was raked over the coals five years ago for demoting Pluto in an exhibit in its new Rose Center at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was clearly disappointed in the committee's work. ''I'm happy there's finally a definition that's unambiguous,'' Dr. Tyson said. ''There hasn't been one in 2,500 years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But roundness, he said, is not a very interesting attribute to use in classifying astronomical bodies. ''A Plutophile is well served by this definition,'' he said. ''It is one of the few that allow you to utter Pluto and Jupiter in the same breath.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., called the definition ''a nice solution that works both inside and outside the solar system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody agrees that a little clarity is needed when it comes to categorizing the members of the solar system. The proposed definition would come as a relief to schoolchildren and others who have rallied to the cause of Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet (if that is what it is) has been an oddball ever since Clyde Tombaugh spied it wandering in the outer reaches of the solar system beyond Neptune in 1930. Not only is it much smaller than the other eight planets, only a fiftieth the mass of Earth, but its orbit is unusually elliptical and inclined to the plane that marks the orbits of the other planets. In recent decades, however, other objects with orbits like Pluto's have been discovered in the Kuiper Belt, a junkyard of icy debris beyond Neptune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many astronomers began to argue that it made more sense to think of Pluto as a Kuiper Belt object, a minor planet instead of a planet. When it was reported that the Hayden Planetarium had done just that in its new Rose Center, which opened in 2000, a firestorm erupted. Schoolchildren rushed to the defense of lonely little Pluto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the International Astronomical Union appointed a group to come up with a definition that would resolve this tension. The group, led by Ivan Williams of Queen Mary University in London, deadlocked. This year a new group with broader roots took up the problem. After a sleepless night in Paris this spring, what Dr. Gingerich calls a miracle took place: ''We had reached unanimous agreement.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nod to the idea of classifying Pluto with the Kuiper Belt, the group proposed calling planets with elongated orbits beyond Neptune ''Plutons,'' while emphasizing that they would still be planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Brown pointed out that at least 43 other publicly known objects in the Kuiper Belt were big enough to fit the planet definition, and that his group was sitting on a list of dozens more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss said, ''We're going to have more planets inside the solar system than we have outside.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''Being a planet used to be an old boys' club, with eight or nine members.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss and Dr. Brown were especially critical of a feature of the new definition that would bestow planetary status on Charon, a moon of Pluto. With a diameter of about 700 miles, Charon is big enough for gravity to crush all other forces and make it round, but so are some of Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, as well as our own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference, according to the definition, is that the center of gravity for Pluto and Charon is between them, not inside either one. So technically, Charon is not orbiting Pluto but is orbiting the center of gravity of the two bodies. The center of gravity for the Earth and its moon, on the other hand, is inside the Earth. Dr. Boss calls this ''a legalistic definition.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown said, ''That one doesn't pass the smell test.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really hoped something good would come of this,'' he said. ''They proved me wrong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is sad,'' he added. ''Clarity would have been nice.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern, however, who is the principal scientist on the New Horizons space mission to Pluto, said the new definition was logical and not arbitrary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes sense, he said, that there could be dozens of planets in the solar system. The new discoveries in the Kuiper Belt have put Pluto in context, he said. ''Pluto is no longer the misfit,'' Dr. Stern said. ''It is closer to average than the Earth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''Nature is much richer than our imagination. Life is tough, life is complicated. Get over it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everybody cares about the great planet debate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, a widely known hunter of planets around other stars, said in an e-mail message, ''I am not attending the I.A.U. meeting, nor do I care about the outcome of any vote about whether Pluto and Xena are 'planets.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The universe,'' Dr. Marcy added, ''contains so much beauty and so many mysteries that we astronomers already have our hands full figuring out how it all came about.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''New Planets?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a new definition of planets is approved by the International Astronomical Union, our solar system will retain Pluto as a planet and add three others: Ceres, an asteroid; Charon, a moon of Pluto, and 2003 UB313, an object discovered in 2005.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pasadena, Calif. -- LAST year, two colleagues and I announced that we had found an unknown body slightly larger than Pluto in the far reaches of our solar system. Since then, astronomical confusion has reigned on Earth and, depending on whom you ask, our solar system has 8, 9, 10 or, shockingly, 53 planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week, the International Astronomical Union, which oversees astronomical rules and conventions, will vote on a strict definition of ''planet.'' The result of that vote is hard to predict, but soon, we'll likely lose a planet we've gotten to know for the past 76 years, or gain at least one more.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a scientific point of view, the status of Pluto and the newly discovered object -- stuck with the cumbersome label 2003 UB313 until astronomers decide what it is -- is easy to discern. If you were to look unemotionally at the hundreds of thousands of bodies orbiting the sun, only eight (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) would clearly distinguish themselves by their large sizes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining objects, which are significantly smaller, are mostly either rocky bodies in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter or icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt in the distant regions beyond Neptune. Of the more than 1,000 known objects in the Kuiper Belt, 2003 UB313 and Pluto are the largest and second largest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why is there any debate at all, if the scientific view is so clear?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all dates back to the discovery of Pluto in 1930. At the time, Pluto was thought to be considerably larger than it is now known to be, and the existence of the rest of the Kuiper Belt was unknown. No other reasonable category existed in which to place the object, so Pluto became the oddball planet at the edge of the solar system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Pluto has been very much a part of our mental map of the universe. You'll find it on lunchboxes, postage stamps, NASA Web sites, and in the mnemonics that children learn to remember the planets. Pluto's qualifications may be more cultural than scientific, but we've fully embraced it as a planet in good standing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why astronomers who question Pluto's status come across as bullies trying to kick everyone's favorite cosmic underdog out of the club. And while they have a point -- after all, it's not a great idea to let cultural attachments dictate scientific categories -- they're missing an important part of the picture.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of it this way. The term ''planet'' is similar to ''continent.'' The word helps us organize our world, but the division between continents and subcontinents is thoroughly arbitrary. Yet no union of geologists has tried to vote on a definition of ''continent,'' and no one is concerned that letting culture determine the difference between Australia, the smallest continent, and Greenland, the largest island, somehow erodes science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like continents, planets are defined more by how we think of them than by someone's after-the-fact pronouncement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How then should we think about 2003 UB313? I'm biased, but I like to imagine this question through the eyes of the child I was in the 1970's, when astronauts had just walked on the Moon, the first pictures were coming back from the surface of Mars and the launch of Skylab promised a future of unbroken space exploration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I had heard back then about the discovery of something at the edge of the solar system, I wouldn't have waited for a body of astronomers to tell me what it was. I would have immediately cut out a little disk of white paper and taped it to the poster of planets on my bedroom wall. That night, I would have looked up, straining to see the latest addition to our solar system, hoping that I, too, might someday find a new planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, many plans for exploration and scientific study have been scrapped, and those that haven't are being scaled back. It's hard to have the same excitement about a limitless future in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomical union isn't helping matters by forcing a Hobson's choice: stick with the current nine planets or open the floodgates to a yawn-inducing 53 or more. It's a ''No Ice Ball Left Behind'' policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope the union takes another galactic approach, and simply declares 2003 UB313 our 10th, full-fledged planet. Doing so might convince schoolchildren to put new paper disks on their walls, to look up to the sky and realize that exploration does continue, and that they can be part of it, too.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon is slightly squashed, as if someone had held it at the poles between thumb and forefinger and squeezed, flattening it around its equatorial midsection. That is not surprising. The Moon spins, and the outward centrifugal force should indeed have generated a bulge as the molten magma of a young moon cooled to solid rock eons ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as far back as 1799, the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace noticed a back-and-forth wobbling because of the Moon's deformed shape. Although the flattening was slight -- the Moon's girth, 2,159 miles, is about 2.5 miles greater than its pole-to-pole height -- it was still greater than would be expected for its current rotation period of 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes and 11.5 seconds.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The puzzle had been the Moon was too flat,'' said Maria T. Zuber, a professor of geophysics and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space probes of the 1960's and 1970's found a second deformity of the Moon: it is slightly elongated along the Moon-Earth axis. That is, if the Moon were sliced in half along its equator, the cross-section would not be a circle, but more like a football, with one of the narrow ends pointing toward Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no one could come up with a completely convincing explanation for the Moon's current shape. That is not its only mystery. Another is why its near side, which always faces Earth, is so different in material and appearance from the far side. The Moon's origin still holds some uncertainties, although many scientists believe that it formed out of the debris when a Mars-size object struck Earth 4.5 billion years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Quite a lot of the darned thing is still quite mysterious,'' said Kimmo Innanen, a professor of astronomy at York University in Toronto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current issue of Science, Dr. Zuber, with Jack Wisdom and Ian Garrick-Bethell, say they have a possible answer to the problem of the Moon's shape. Actually, they say they have several.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Laplace did not know is that the Moon is moving away from Earth and slowing down. Years of bouncing laser beams off mirrors left on the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts show that each year the Moon is another 1.5 inches farther from Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon now orbits in what astronomers call a 1:1 resonance with Earth, its orbital period equal to its rotation time so that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, in the past, the Moon was much closer and took less time to orbit. With the 1:1 resonance, the Moon spun faster as well, possibly explaining the bulge. But those calculations did not come with the correct answer for observed distortion along the Moon-Earth axis. ''They ought to be self-consistent,'' Dr. Zuber said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One suggestion has been that the Moon by chance cooled into this somewhat odd configuration. Other solid planets like Earth are not exactly in their predicted shape either.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.I.T. scientists, however, say the observed distortions are larger than would be expected for chance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they suggest that in the Moon's early history, it traveled in an elliptical rather than a circular orbit and that it was in a 3:2 resonance, spinning three times for every two orbits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been in this resonance for only a few hundred million years at most, the scientists said, before tidal forces slowed its spin and it fell into the current 1:1 circular resonance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their calculations show that such an orbit would provide the necessary forces to produce the Moon's shape. ''There's a 200-year-old problem, and we've got the first solution that works,'' Dr. Zuber said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also found that orbits with higher resonances, like two spins for every orbit, could produce the same lunar shape. ''It's a bunch of families of solutions,'' Dr. Zuber said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an accompanying commentary in Science, Dr. Innanen described the proposed solution as ''ingenious.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Peter M. Goldreich, an emeritus professor of astrophysics and planetary physics at the California Institute of Technology, said the M.I.T. team did not explain how the Moon was caught in the 3:2 resonance. ''That is a real weakness,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an elliptical orbit and a 3:2 resonance may explain the shape, they would not explain the disparities between the Moon's sides. The crust on the near side is much thinner, with vast plains of dark basalt, called maria (pronounced MAH-ree-uh), that erupted long ago. The crust of the far side is thicker, with many more craters; there are few maria.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly because of the denser basalt of the mare, the Moon's center of mass is not at the center, but shifted by more than a mile. But how that shift occurred is unknown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would be a good research project,'' Dr. Innanen said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the mysteries depend on a better understanding of the Moon's early history. Under the prevailing theory that the Moon formed after something the size of Mars slammed into Earth, scientists believe that the Moon initially orbited very close, perhaps just 16,000 miles from Earth (compared with roughly 238,000 miles today) before moving outward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David J. Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at Caltech, said the evidence for the collision theory was solid. Then he stopped. He said instead, ''The argument against the alternatives is strong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, scientists have suggested that the Moon is somehow captured gravitationally or that it formed out of material spun off from the Earth. The mysteries have persisted because little new data have been collected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the three decades since the Apollo Moon landings, NASA has sent only one probe, a bargain-basement one, to the Moon, the Lunar Prospector that orbited it in 1998 and 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's push to send astronauts back has led to robotic missions as well, including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, scheduled for launching in 2008. India, Japan and China are also planning robotic missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, scientists say, could lead to a scientific renaissance in the study of the Moon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Talk to me in five years,'' Dr. Zuber said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Diagram: ''A Different Spin''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To explain a 2.5-mile bulge at the Moon's equator, a new theory proposes that early in its history, the Moon was much closer to the Earth and spinning up to six times as fast as it does today. It orbited the Earth about every 7.3 days rather than the current 27.3 days, rotating 1.5 times per orbit. The centrifugal force of the rapid spin caused the partially molten Moon to bulge slightly.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tiny star with a giant planet is further muddling astronomers' notion of what a planet is. The planet is one of perhaps only two or three planets around other stars to be photographed directly, but it may be more like a star than a planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tiny star, known as Oph1622, is so small that it never lighted up, a failed star known as a brown dwarf. Even among brown dwarfs, it is small, with a mass equal to 14 Jupiters, or about one-seventy-fifth that of the Sun.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published yesterday on the Web site of the journal Science, astronomers at the University of Toronto and the European Southern Observatory report that a photograph of Oph1622 also shows a planet about half as large as the star itself, with a mass equal to seven Jupiters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two are separated by 22 billion miles, or about six times the distance between the Sun and Pluto. Both are young, about a million years old. Astronomers refer to them both by a recently coined word, planemo (pronounced PLAN-uh-mo), short for planetary mass object -- planet-size bodies that may or may not be planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really stands out as something quite unusual and intriguing,'' said Ray Jayawardhana, a professor of astronomy at the University of Toronto and an author of the Science paper. ''The Oph1622 pair adds to the rich diversity of worlds that have been discovered recently, a diversity that we couldn't really have imagined barely a decade ago.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the solar system, astronomers have been debating where to put the dividing line between planets and smaller clumps of rock and ice like comets and asteroids. The discovery of an object larger than Pluto in the outer solar system last year has rekindled debate on whether Pluto, by far the smallest among the current roster of nine planets, should be demoted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the solar system, the dividing line between planets and stars has also become blurry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade astronomers have found 200 planets around other stars. Almost all of these have been indirectly detected from a slight shift in the frequency of a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of a planet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, astronomers reported the first direct sighting of a distant planet, with about the mass of five Jupiters, seen next to a brown dwarf known as 2M1207 about 230 light-years away in the constellation Hydra. Astronomers have since seen small, faint companions around a couple other stars, but are uncertain whether those companions are planets or brown dwarfs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oph1622, about 400 light-years from Earth, should add to the confusion. Dr. Jayawardhana said its companion had the mass of a planet but was born in the manner of stars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Star systems form in two steps. First, a cloud of gas collapses under gravity into one, two and sometimes three stars. A disk of leftover gas and dust then coalesces into planets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is impossible to roll the clock back millions or billions of years, and astronomers cannot conclusively say how some objects formed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown dwarfs, by some definitions, have a mass greater than about 13 Jupiters, the minimum amount for fusion reactions involving a heavy form of hydrogen known as deuterium to begin. (The fusing of ordinary hydrogen requires much higher temperatures and much higher mass, about 75 times that of Jupiter. That is the upper mass limit for brown dwarfs.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some astronomers say that many brown dwarfs are embryonic stars that were ejected out of nascent star systems. Others say that brown dwarfs formed just like other stars, but from smaller gas clouds. Astronomers have also observed free-floating planet-size objects not in orbit around a star, and they debate whether these objects formed in the same way as stars or were ejected from other star systems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers had thought it was impossible to form stars much smaller than the Sun, because the outward pressure of gas molecules bouncing around would keep small gas clouds from collapsing. ''People used to think it's hard to make stars this small,'' said Paolo Padoan, a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Oph1622's planet could not have formed the usual planet way, Dr. Jayawardhana said. Most known planetary disks have only 1 percent to 2 percent as much mass as the parent star, and thus the disk rotating around Oph1622 would have been too small to produce a planet half as large as itself, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complex computer simulations by Dr. Padoan show that turbulence within the gas clouds can generate shock waves traveling a few thousand miles per hour that tear the clouds into smaller pieces and provide the necessary kick to overcome the outward pressure and cause the smaller clouds to collapse.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it boasts the extra safety of Arctic temperatures, the seed bank is just the latest life-preservation plan to reach reality, joining genetic banks like the Frozen Ark, a British program that is storing DNA samples from endangered species like the scimitar-horned oryx, the Seychelles Fregate beetle and the British field cricket.  </p>

Burrows, an author of several books on space, is the director of the Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program at N.Y.U.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Bush has already proposed a Moon base. ''He just needs to be told what it's good for,'' Dr. Shapiro said. Dr. Shapiro has written a number of books on the origins of life on Earth, as well as ''Planetary Dreams: The Quest to Discover Life Beyond Earth,'' where he unveiled the civilization rescue project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, the same year the book came out, Dr. Shapiro wrote an essay with Mr. Burrows for Ad Astra, an astronomy journal. There, they formally laid out their plan for the rescue alliance, beginning by warning that ''the most enduring pictures to come back from the Apollo missions were not of astronauts cavorting on the Sea of Tranquillity, nor even of the lunar landscape itself.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were the haunting views of Earth, seen for the first time not as a boundless and resilient colossus of land and water,'' they continued, ''but as a startlingly vulnerable lifeboat precariously plying a vast and dangerous sea: a 'blue marble' in a black void.'' A conversation shortly after the essay was published, Dr. Shapiro recalled, resounded with the earnest imagination of science fiction drama:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Shapiro: ''We've got to use space to protect humanity!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burrows: ''By God! Yes!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept is not new, but there is some fresh momentum. Mr. Burrows's new book, ''The Survival Imperative: Using Space to Protect Earth,'' is due out this month. And the physicist Stephen W. Hawking, who is not part of the group, began arguing this summer that human survival depends on leaving Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission of the Alliance to Rescue Civilization has also attracted the support of Col. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, who now devotes much of his time to the idea of Martian colonization.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes a big reason to go to the Moon, because, frankly, it's a lousy place to be,'' Colonel Aldrin said in a telephone interview. ''But this is exactly the kind of planning as a human race we need to secure our future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But the A.R.C. idea isn't ahead of its time because it's needed right now. It's a reasonable thing to do with our space technology, sending valuable stuff to a reliable off-site location. NASA is certainly not bending backwards to do it. It's the private people like A.R.C.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born and raised within walking distance of the Bronx Zoo -- and he walked that distance often -- Dr. Shapiro developed an early interest in biodiversity. He frets over the frailty of civilization and the planet, but he is not a pessimist. He compares the Moon-base idea to a safe-deposit box.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes sense to protect the things you value,'' he said. ''But we, as a civilization, we don't have anything like that.'' The trouble with doomsday, Dr. Shapiro argues, is that it is almost always rendered in popular culture as grandiose, though in reality, many minor incidents present substantial everyday threats.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1918, an influenza strain killed some 30 million people; a possible new bird flu strain spurs contemporary panic. In January 2003, a computer virus shut down airlines, banks and governments. That same year, a tree fell on power lines outside Cleveland, resulting in a blackout for much of the Northeast. Doomsday can be understated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I'm not here to predict doomsday; I'm here for sanity,'' Dr. Shapiro said. ''When we've gained what we've gained, we should fight to keep it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And, worst-case scenario, if it's all for nothing, we'll have a nice museum.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: SAVING SPECIES -- The Alliance to Rescue Civilization differs from other so-called doomsday projects. It envisions a lunar base where, in the event of global catastrophe, humans could carry on, protecting DNA samples of life on Earth and maintaining a bank of human knowledge. (Photo by NASA)  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when global warming has become an overriding issue, NASA has been delaying or canceling programs that could shed light on how the climate changes. The shortsighted cutbacks appear to result from sharply limiting NASA's budget while giving it hugely expensive tasks like repairing the stricken shuttle fleet, finishing construction of the space station, and preparing to explore the Moon and Mars. Something had to give, and NASA's choices included research into how the planet's climate is responding to greenhouse gas emissions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's shifting priorities may have been signaled by subtle changes in its mission statement this year, as described by Andrew Revkin in The Times. Although the agency had previously led off its goals with ''to understand and protect our home planet,'' a new mission statement reads simply, ''To pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency officials note that sub-goal 3A still proposes to ''study earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs.'' But earth studies seem to be in trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has canceled a deep space observatory to monitor solar radiation, water vapor, clouds, aerosols and other things important to climate change. It has delayed a mission with Japan to measure global precipitation, decided not to pay for a mission to measure soil moisture around the world, and reduced the money available to analyze data. Under Congressional pressure, the agency has reinstated a mission to study aerosols and solar radiation from orbit. But it has little money to do much else in coming years. A National Academy of Sciences panel warned that the nation's system of environmental satellites was ''at risk of collapse.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems in earth sciences are part of a broader slowdown in science missions as NASA tries to do too much with too little. NASA officials sometimes say that they are slowing the rate of growth in science budgets. But Congressional analysts say the agency cut its science spending in 2006 to cover unexpectedly expensive shuttle repairs. It now plans small increases that won't keep up with inflation or bring spending back to previous levels for many years. One analyst likened NASA to a mugger who takes $100 from a victim and then returns $20 a year, telling the recipient to be thankful.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Senate committee has approved $1 billion in emergency funds to reimburse programs that were cut to pay for the shuttle repairs. If that doesn't fly, count home-planet studies and other science programs as a casualty of the administration's insistence on completing the space station.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early February, the statement was quietly altered, with the phrase ''to understand and protect our home planet'' deleted. In this year's budget and planning documents, the agency's mission is ''to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David E. Steitz, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the aim was to square the statement with President Bush's goal of pursuing human spaceflight to the Moon and Mars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the change comes as an unwelcome surprise to many NASA scientists, who say the ''understand and protect'' phrase was not merely window dressing but actively influenced the shaping and execution of research priorities. Without it, these scientists say, there will be far less incentive to pursue projects to improve understanding of terrestrial problems like climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We refer to the mission statement in all our research proposals that go out for peer review, whenever we have strategy meetings,'' said Philip B. Russell, a 25-year NASA veteran who is an atmospheric chemist at the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. ''As civil servants, we're paid to carry out NASA's mission. When there was that very easy-to-understand statement that our job is to protect the planet, that made it much easier to justify this kind of work.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several NASA researchers said they were upset that the change was made at NASA headquarters without consulting the agency's 19,000 employees or informing them ahead of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the ''understand and protect'' phrase was deleted in February, when the Bush administration submitted budget and planning documents to Congress, its absence has only recently registered with NASA employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steitz, the NASA spokesman, said the agency might have to improve internal communications, but he defended the way the change was made, saying it reflected the management style of Michael D. Griffin, the administrator at the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Strategic planning comes from headquarters down,'' he said, and added, ''I don't think there was any mal-intent or idea of exclusion.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The line about protecting the earth was added to the mission statement in 2002 under Sean O'Keefe, the first NASA administrator appointed by President Bush, and was drafted in an open process with scientists and employees across the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established the agency in 1958, the first objective of the agency was listed as ''the expansion of human knowledge of the earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since 1972, when NASA launched the first Landsat satellite to track changes on the earth's surface, the agency has been increasingly involved in monitoring the environment and as a result has been immersed in political disputes over environmental policy and spending, said W. Henry Lambright, a professor of public administration and political science at Syracuse University who has studied the trend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift in language echoes a shift in the agency's budgets toward space projects and away from earth missions, a shift that began in 2004, the year Mr. Bush announced his vision of human missions to the Moon and beyond.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''understand and protect'' phrase was cited repeatedly by James E. Hansen, a climate scientist at NASA who said publicly last winter that he was being threatened by political appointees for speaking out about the dangers posed by greenhouse gas emissions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hansen's comments started a flurry of news media coverage in late January; on Feb. 3, Mr. Griffin issued a statement of ''scientific openness.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised mission statement was released with the agency's proposed 2007 budget on Feb. 6. But Mr. Steitz said Dr. Hansen's use of the phrase and its subsequent disappearance from the mission statement was ''pure coincidence.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hansen, who directs the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a NASA office, has been criticized by industry-backed groups and Republican officials for associating with environmental campaigners and his endorsement of Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hansen said the change might reflect White House eagerness to shift the spotlight away from global warming.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're making it clear that they have the authority to make this change, that the president sets the objectives for NASA, and that they prefer that NASA work on something that's not causing them a problem,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space Adventures Ltd., a company based in Vienna, Va., that has sent three very wealthy men to orbit the earth on the International Space Station, is planning to announce today that future customers will be able to take an hour-and-a-half trip outside the station as well.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price? Just $15 million, on top of the $20 million for the flight itself. For people who can afford $20 million for a 10-day vacation, the extra $15 million might seem like little more than overtipping.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalks have been approved by the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation, which provides training and transportation to the station on Soyuz rockets, said Eric Anderson, the chief executive of Space Adventures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the initials for extravehicular activity, the technical term for a spacewalk, Aleksei Krasnov, director of the Russian space agency, said in a statement that space tourists ''could potentially perform an EVA'' with a month's training, and if they had the proper ''physical and psychological capabilities.'' The Russians have been eager to commercialize space and get most of the fees that Space Adventures collects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokeswoman, Melissa Mathews, said the agency had not been informed by Russia about any intention to sell EVA's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer than 450 people have traveled to space, and the club of spacewalkers is even more exclusive. Just 151 people have stepped outside the relative safety of their craft to greet the void with only a visor to separate life and death.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Spacewalk is the ultimate experience that we've managed to invent as humans,'' said Tom Jones, a former astronaut and spacewalker who is an adviser to Space Adventures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being outside the craft when ''there's nothing between you and the ground below but empty space,'' he said, is ''incomparable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the nausea and vomiting that some astronauts experience, and which could preclude a spacewalk, Mr. Jones said ''almost everybody feels good after two or three days.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gutsy decision by Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, to launch the shuttle Discovery despite warnings that foam-shedding problems had not been fully resolved appears to be vindicated, at least for now. The shuttle landed safely yesterday after a 13-day mission in which all major objectives were achieved. The successful completion of this second test flight since the Columbia disaster signals that the shuttle fleet is ready to return to the huge task ahead: completing the international space station now circling, half-built, in low Earth orbit overhead.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main objective on this flight was to show that the shuttles are safe enough to fly again. In that respect, the results were encouraging. Images produced by a large array of cameras and sensors showed no major impacts from falling debris like that which doomed the Columbia. Space officials believe that Discovery sustained less damage during ascent than any shuttle flight in memory. Some experts believe the shuttle may actually be safer today, thanks to numerous modifications, than ever before. That is to be fervently hoped for, given two fatal accidents in the first 114 flights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important task carried out by the astronauts was to repair a damaged transporter on the space station that is used to move a robotic arm from one location to another. Without that transporter in action, it would be impossible to finish assembling the station. Our own view is that the station is of minimal value, but given the administration's determination to finish building it by 2010, this repair was of critical importance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The daunting construction task will require 16 shuttle flights over the next four years, a pace that may be difficult to maintain. Indeed, the next shuttle flight is scheduled to lift off in six or seven weeks. Any delays will compound the scheduling pressures in future years, raising the specter that NASA may again be tempted to cut safety corners to meet a launching schedule.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery's seemingly unblemished flight raises some hope that a shuttle mission to rejuvenate the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most important scientific instrument, may prove feasible. Such a mission would be somewhat more risky than a trip to the space station because the astronauts would not have a place to take refuge were the shuttle orbiter to be damaged. But the scientific payoff, in our view, would be far greater than any likely research benefits from the space station. Astronauts have made several previous missions to service the Hubble without incident, and if the shuttle really is safer than ever, they could presumably do so again.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Welcome back, Discovery,'' Stephen N. Frick, a NASA astronaut communicating with the shuttle from mission control in Houston, said to the shuttle commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, after the shuttle had come to a halt.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey replied, ''This was a great mission, a really great mission.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's successful return nonetheless marks the beginning of the end of the shuttle program, which President Bush has ordered to be shut down by 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that time, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is to perform 16 more shuttle missions to complete the International Space Station, the half-built orbiting laboratory that was the Discovery's destination in this flight. The agency will then embark on the president's stated goal of returning to the Moon in a new generation of space vehicles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The morale boost of a successful flight after the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and a frustrating first test flight last year was evident in the beaming smiles of the crew and NASA officials -- even Michael D. Griffin, the self-described emotionless engineer who is the space agency's administrator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, said at a news conference at mission control in Houston, ''The shuttle is back.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, questions remain about whether the program has solved the safety problems that have plagued it over the years -- problems that NASA officials pledged to pursue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers said that the success of this mission reinforced their view that they could step up the tempo of launchings, with the shuttle Atlantis returning to space as early as Aug. 28 and the mission after that beginning in mid-December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin cautioned at a news conference here at the Kennedy Space Center, ''We're not going to get overconfident.'' Engineers and analysts will pore over the data from this flight in the coming weeks and months, he said, to better understand issues like foam debris from the shuttle's external tank before launching the next mission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of foam shed in the Discovery's July 4 liftoff -- the problem that doomed the Columbia and continued to plague last year's return-to-flight mission -- posed no threat to the shuttle, with the biggest piece weighing less than two ounces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a member of the independent board that investigated the Columbia disaster said the risks of shuttle flight were still very real.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This shows that with appropriate care and vigilance, the odds of operating the shuttle with acceptable risk are good,'' said the board member, John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. But he added: ''It doesn't mean the shuttle is safe. The shuttle will remain a very risky vehicle to be operated with extreme care.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew took thousands of pounds of supplies to the half-finished space station, performed three spacewalks in which they repaired broken equipment to allow the resumption of construction on future shuttle flights, and tested possible repair techniques.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also carried up a new crew member, Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut from the European Space Agency. Mr. Reiter remained behind aboard the space station, bringing its crew to three for the first time since the Columbia disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew was led by Colonel Lindsey, who was making his fourth trip to space and his second as a commander. The pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, was on his second shuttle mission. The two spacewalkers were Piers J. Sellers of England and Michael E. Fossum. The flight engineer, Cmdr. Lisa M. Nowak of the Navy, operated the robot arm during the spacewalks, along with Stephanie D. Wilson, who also supervised the transfer of tons of cargo between the two craft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the astronauts' grueling schedule, there was time to both laugh and marvel. At a news conference here on Monday, Colonel Lindsey recalled that Commander Nowak's ponytail, which acquired a will of its own in zero gravity, had gotten stuck on a strip of Velcro in the mid-deck of the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey said he and the pilot, Commander Kelly, had had a view on the way home that was even more spectacular than usual.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It started out in darkness, and of course you see the orange glow as the plasma starts heating up,'' he said, referring to the superheated gases of re-entry into the atmosphere. ''And you can see what looks like explosions out the windows, plasma flashes and things like that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the shuttle banked left, ''I could see the earth below as the sun was coming up,'' he continued. ''And Mark, through his window, through the plasma, could see the moon. It was just wild.'' The shuttle did not break through the cloud layer until just 10,000 feet -- less than a minute before landing. ''I had never gone through weather like that before on a real shuttle landing,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers and engineers who suffered through the Columbia disaster and last year's troubled mission of the Discovery were visibly moved to see a shuttle finally land in Florida again. The Columbia was heading for the Kennedy landing strip when it broke up over Texas, and the Discovery was diverted to Edwards Air Force Base in California for its landing last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Columbia's landing day was a horrible day,'' said Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director. ''Today was a great day.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, lawmakers welcomed the safe return of the shuttle and applauded the crew's effort. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas and chairwoman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on science and space, called the mission ''an important milestone in our nation's space exploration history.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York and the chairman of the House Science Committee, who has been cautious about the shuttle program, commended the NASA scientists, engineers and technicians, who have ''worked tirelessly over the past three years to mitigate the problems that tragically doomed the shuttle Columbia in 2003.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boehlert added, ''While NASA must continue to be vigilant, the shuttle is now poised to proceed'' with planned missions. President Bush issued a statement from the Group of 8 summit meeting in Strelna, Russia, congratulating NASA's workers for ''putting our space program back on track'' and calling the program ''a source of great national pride.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts on space policy also expressed relief that the mission had gone so well. ''They've got the right stuff back,'' said John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added that the success did not change the fact that the shuttle program itself was in its last phase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mr. Bush has decided that Mr. Nixon's space shuttle and Mr. Reagan's space station are not the way he wants to go,'' Mr. Pike said. ''He likes John Kennedy, going to the moon.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A critic of the space agency, Roger A. Pielke Jr., director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado, questioned in an e-mail interview whether the ''acceptable risk'' cited by Professor Logsdon was truly acceptable. ''If the reliability of the shuttle is 99 percent, as NASA has suggested,'' he said, ''then there is a significant possibility thatthere will be another lost shuttle before NASA completes the program.'' In the face of those odds, he went on, ''there is no shame in declaring victory and moving on to the next challenge.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Administrator Griffin, at his news conference, noted that it took a thousand years from the days the first ships ventured out to open water to the safe ocean voyagers of today. Space travel, by comparison, is in its infancy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been doing this stuff for 50 years,'' he said. ''The enterprise is eminently worth doing. It's part of what makes us human.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The vehicle has been totally cleared for entry,'' the lead flight director, Steven Stich, said Sunday.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery crew got word about coming home when Stephen N. Frick, a NASA astronaut, radioed from mission control at the Johnson Space Center here that inspections of the shuttle wings' leading edges and nose cone, which endure the highest heat of re-entry, showed they were free of damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery has two opportunities to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday, at 9:14 a.m. Eastern time or at 10:50 a.m.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it was possible a weather front could move south toward the space center, Mr. Stich said there was a ''reasonable'' chance any showers would hold off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If weather causes the shuttle to remain in orbit for an extra day, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will activate a backup landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California, giving Discovery two landing opportunities at each place on Tuesday, Mr. Stich said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery had been in a holding position some 40 miles from the station since the two craft separated early Saturday. The crew, while stowing gear and preparing for a landing, was waiting for the results of a sensor scan of the craft's heat shield to show it was undamaged by space dust or debris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before and after Discovery departed the station, its crew used sensors at the end of a 50-foot boom attached to a 50-foot robotic arm to check the wings and nose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery is completing only the second shuttle flight since the Columbia disaster three years ago. Columbia and its crew of seven were lost when returning from a mission because of damage caused by launching debris to heat shield panels on a wing. Afterward, NASA spent more than $1 billion in an effort to reduce the debris hazard and improve inspection of shuttles in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA hopes to fly the shuttle 16 more times, primarily for space station construction, before retiring the fleet in 2010. But the Discovery's commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, said that returning to routine missions would not mean business as usual or neglecting the lessons of the Columbia's loss.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After photographs and farewells, the six-member Discovery crew and three astronauts remaining on the station closed hatches and made final checks before the shuttle undocked at 6:08 a.m., Eastern time, and slowly pulled away.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Have a safe journey back, soft landings, and we'll see you on the ground in a few months,'' said Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army, the station flight engineer and science officer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a late-morning news conference, Anthony J. Ceccacci, the shuttle flight director, said the separation of the two spacecraft had gone perfectly. ''We had a by-the-book undocking from the station,'' Mr. Ceccacci said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle pilot, Mark E. Kelly, a commander in the Navy, maneuvered the shuttle to a position about 40 miles from the station, maintaining an option to return and re-dock. Discovery stayed in sight of the station while the shuttle crew completed a final round of inspections to be sure its heat shield was intact.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the shuttle's robot arm and a boom tipped with a pack of laser sensors and a camera, the crew spent three hours making a final survey of the shuttle's nose cap and right wing leading-edge panels, made of the reinforced carbon-carbon composite material that withstands the highest heat of re-entry. The crew inspected the left wing on Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, said at a briefing on Saturday that the left wing had been cleared of concerns for landing, and that a determination on the other two areas should be made by early Sunday following overnight examination of the scanning data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surveys, done for the first time, were intended to look for signs of damage from impacts by dust-size micrometeoroids or space debris. Astronauts aboard the shuttle and the station inspected Discovery for debris damage with sensors and high-definition photography when it arrived, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers cleared the craft to return home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new scans were added to the departure routine to add assurance that all was well. If new, severe problems are detected when ground inspectors study the data, the shuttle could return to the station for repairs or to leave its crew for later rescue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ceccacci said it would take engineers a day to assess the new laser scans and pictures, comparing the results with similar inspections conducted July 5, the day after launching. If all is well, he said, NASA managers will give the crew final permission on Sunday to prepare to leave orbit and land on Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery is completing only the second shuttle flight since the Columbia accident three years ago. Columbia and its crew of seven were lost when returning from a mission because of damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon wing panels from launching debris. NASA spent more than $1 billion to redesign the shuttle system to reduce the debris hazard and to improve inspections in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only remaining concern about Discovery's mission is a slight fuel leak in one of its three auxiliary power units, which power the ship's hydraulic systems for steering and braking when returning to Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said Friday that two of the power units were working fine, but that questions remained about a drop in pressure in the fuel system of the third. A small leak in the suspect unit could be harmless nitrogen gas or flammable hydrazine fuel, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a precaution, he said, the shuttle crew will turn on that unit early Sunday as part of its normal testing to see if the leak rate changes. If it does, the crew could burn off the hydrazine and shut down the unit before returning to Earth to eliminate any fire hazard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shuttle needs only one power unit to land and could return without incident operating two for the first time, Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More evidence is pointing to nitrogen being the source of the leak, he said Saturday, adding that he expected the suspect power unit to be cleared and the shuttle to land with all three operating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle is scheduled to land at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday, but NASA is planning for a possible landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California because of the power unit issue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials called Discovery's mission to the station a success that should lead to resuming construction of the research outpost. The shuttle delivered a German astronaut, Thomas Reiter, to the station for a six-month mission, increasing its crew to three for the first time since the Columbia accident.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following photographs and farewells, the six-member Discovery crew and three astronauts remaining on the station closed hatches and made final checks before the shuttle undocked at 6:08 a.m. EDT and slowly pulled away.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Have a safe journey back, soft landings and we'll see you on the ground in a few months," said Jeffrey Williams, station flight engineer and science officer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery pilot Mark E. Kelly, a commander in the Navy, maneuvered the shuttle away to a position about 40 miles from the station, maintaining an option to return and re-dock. Discovery was to stay in sight of the station while its crew did a final round of inspections to be sure its heat shield was intact.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery's robot arm and a boom tipped with a pack of laser sensors and cameras are used to make the final survey of the shuttle's nose cap and right wing leading edge panels, made of the reinforced carbon-carbon composite material that withstands the highest heat of reentry. The crew inspected the left wing on Friday while attached to the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surveys, being done for the first time, are intended to look for any sign of damage from impacts by dust-sized micrometeoroids or space debris. Astronauts aboard the shuttle and the station previously inspected Discovery for debris damage with sensors and high-definition photography when it arrived, and NASA managers cleared the craft to return home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new scans were added to the departure routine to give added assurance that all is well. If new, severe problems were detected after ground inspectors study the data, the shuttle could return to the station for potential repairs or to leave its crew for later rescue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery is completing only the second shuttle flight since the Columbia tragedy three years ago. Columbia and its crew of seven were lost when returning from a mission because of launch debris damage to reinforced carbon-carbon wing panels. NASA spent more than $1 billion to redesign the shuttle system to reduce the debris hazard and to improve inspection of shuttles while in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only remaining concern about Discovery's so-far successful mission is a slight fuel leak in one of the craft's three auxiliary power units, which power the ships hydraulic systems for steering and braking when returning to Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, said Friday that two of the power units were working fine, but questions remained about a drop in pressure in the fuel system of the third. A small leak in the suspect unit could be harmless nitrogen gas or flammable hydrazine fuel, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a precaution, he said, the shuttle crew will turn on the unit with the leak early Sunday as part of its normal testing to see if the leak rate changes. If it does, the crew could burn off the hydrazine and shut down the unit before the shuttle returns to Earth to eliminate any fire hazard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shuttle only needs one power unit to land and could return without incident operating two for the first time in the history of the shuttle program, Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday morning, but NASA decided to plan for a possible landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California because of the power unit issue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials called Discovery's mission to the station a success that should lead to resuming construction of the research outpost after a three-year hiatus. The shuttle delivered German astronaut Thomas Reiter to the station for a six-month mission, boosting its crew from two to three for the first time since the Columbia accident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle astronauts performed three space walks at the station, repairing equipment and putting tools and equipment in place for future construction missions. Discovery also delivered more than three tons of research equipment, food, water and clothing to the station and is returning with two tons of discarded equipment, trash and experiment samples.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 14 -- The crews of the space shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station busily wrapped up a week of joint operations on Friday, stowing equipment and doing extra inspections of the shuttle's heat shield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm and a package of camera and laser sensors to check the Discovery's wing for any damage from micrometeoroids or space debris it might have sustained while docked to the station. This first-time scan is part of NASA's effort to assess the shuttle's condition before it makes its fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere on Monday morning.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery, with six astronauts aboard, is to depart from the station early Saturday morning. The three crewmen on the station, including Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency, who arrived with the Discovery last week, are to make a final inspection of the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minor problems with the station's robot arm put the crew behind schedule, and mission control here at the Johnson Space Center gave the Discovery's commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, the option of forgoing the added wing inspection. But Colonel Lindsey chose to have his crew do the extra scans, which revealed no obvious damage to the material that withstands the hottest temperatures of re-entry, approaching 3,000 degrees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier inspections with the sensors and by station astronauts before the shuttle docked showed no damage from debris at launch. This final look searched for nicks from dust-size micrometeoroids that circle the planet and other debris that may have hit the critical leading edges of the shuttle's wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The edges are made of a hard but brittle heat-protection material called reinforced carbon-carbon. This was the material damaged by launching debris on the shuttle Columbia three years ago, leading to loss of the craft and its seven-member crew when it re-entered the atmosphere on its way to landing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials and the crew said the shuttle looked in good condition to undock from the station on Saturday to begin the trip back to Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a great ship, and it's ready to come home,'' the mission pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, said in an interview on Friday. ''It's going to be a safe landing.'' While mission managers have cleared Discovery for landing, they continued to monitor what they called minor problems with two of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units that operate the hydraulics system used for steering and braking during landing. One unit appeared to be overheating and the other has a leak of either fuel or gas used to pressurize it. The shuttle needs only one operating unit to land.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program and chairman of the team assessing shuttle risk, said late Friday that two of the power units were working fine, but questions remained about a drop in pressure in the fuel system of the third. There is ''a lot of circumstantial evidence'' that the leak involves the nitrogen gas that pressurizes the system, he said, which would be of no concern.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to be cautious, he said, the shuttle crew would start up the suspect unit early Sunday to see if the leak rate gets worse. If nothing changes, he said, the unit probably will be used along with the other two for re-entry. If the test shows a bigger potential problem, he said in a televised news conference, the crew would burn off the flammable hydrazine fuel, shut down the unit and return operating the other two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said the leak, even if involving the fuel, was very small -- about six drops an hour -- and was away from any heat source that could ignite the limited amount of fuel vapor that could be trapped in the aft end of the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are 100,000 times below the flammability limit for a leak this size,'' he said, ''You do not have a flammability concern for entry.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation does not represent a significant hazard, he said, but any potential hydrazine leak must be treated seriously.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle crew started its day by deactivating the Italian-built Leonardo cargo module and moving it back to Discovery's cargo bay. Leonardo carried more than 7,000 pounds of equipment, experiments, food and other cargo to the station. NASA officials said early weather reports were good for a landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday morning, ending the second shuttle flight since the Columbia disaster.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 10 -- In the days before the July 4 launching of the space shuttle Discovery at Cape Canaveral, Fla., summer thunderclouds and the threat of rain caused NASA to postpone it twice, each pause costing about $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space agency officials gave a collective shrug and pointed out what every Floridian knows: afternoon thundershowers are as much a part of life there as heat and mosquitoes. On the day the shuttle finally lifted off, the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said that in Florida, ''if you get one day out of three in the summer when you can launch, that ain't bad.''  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one might ask why shuttles must be launched from such a chancy place at all. And showers are the least of the weather problems faced by the Kennedy Space Center and three other NASA facilities that are a crucial part of the manned space program: all four face a real threat of damage from hurricanes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space experts say the choices of the sites for the most important facilities arose from a blend of sound science and hardball politics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the Johnson Space Center here, which runs the human spaceflight program. Last year it had to be shut down as Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf of Mexico coast, with management of the International Space Station temporarily passed to Russian flight controllers. The storm ultimately turned to the north and east, but the incident underscored the site's vulnerability.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not for nothing, said John M. Logsdon, the director of the space policy institute at George Washington University, is the site called the Johnson Space Center, as in Lyndon B. -- though he said that the placement had more to do with the efforts of Houston's powerful longtime congressman Albert C. Thomas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, where the shuttles are put through their final assembly and launched, was hit by four hurricanes in 2004 alone. Each left a mark, with one ripping 820 large siding panels from the Vehicle Assembly Building, a gargantuan structure 525 feet tall. According to NASA documents, the building was designed to withstand winds of 114 miles per hour, the equivalent of a weak Category 3 hurricane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that this year's hurricane season will be very active, with as many as 16 named storms, 8 to 10 of which could become hurricanes and 4 to 6 of those that could be Category 3 or higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans were struck by Hurricane Katrina last year. Several buildings were damaged at Stennis, where the space shuttle's engines are tested. At Michoud, heroic efforts to keep drainage pumps operating through the storm prevented the swamping of the site, which makes the shuttle's bright orange fuel tank. Hundreds of workers at the two facilities lost their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stennis center was named for John C. Stennis, the Mississippi senator famed for his willingness to use his seniority to benefit his state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for launching from Florida, Dr. Logsdon said, referring to President John F. Kennedy, ''the fact that Senator George Smathers of Florida was one of Kennedy's drinking and carousing buddies may not have been irrelevant.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But each of the facilities has sound reasons for its location as well, Dr. Logsdon said. Florida offers advantages for launching missiles and spaceships, which is why the Air Force already had a missile range at Cape Canaveral when NASA came along. Firing off the eastern coast of Florida means that rockets can be launched over water -- and if something goes wrong, there are no people below to be hurt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, rockets can be fired west across the ocean from sunny California as well -- but Florida has physics on its side. Shooting to the east follows the rotation of Earth, and launching relatively close to the Equator gives a speed boost to orbit, a kind of running start derived from the greater circumference of the globe toward its midpoint.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in 1865, the novelist Jules Verne saw the benefits of launching from Florida, and in ''From the Earth to the Moon,'' he put the massive gun for his fictional spaceshot there. Verne envisioned a competition for space activities between Tampa, Fla., and Galveston Bay in Texas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the real-life space program had chosen to launch its rockets from Florida, the plants that made them needed to be relatively convenient to the site. The external tanks are too large to transport by rail or highway, so they are taken to Florida by special barge along the adjacent Intracoastal Waterway, which runs up to the Michoud plant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the choice of New Orleans for that assembly plant may well have had something to do with the influence of Louisiana lawmakers, Dr. Logsdon called it ''an honest technical decision.'' A former factory for military vehicles for World War II, Michoud had remarkable features -- including a building with 43 acres under one roof -- that were more important than politics, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he said the Stennis center filled the need for ''a place out in the country where you could make a lot of noise,'' from the testing of the Saturn V engines onward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Johnson Space Center, however, could have been built in any number of places, and sites around the nation were considered, said Christopher Kraft, who served as a flight director in the early days of the space program. The program had been managed from Virginia at first.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason we came here was because Albert Thomas was head of the Appropriations Committee,'' Dr. Kraft said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the engineers in Virginia wanted to stay there, he recalled, but the program director, Robert R. Gilruth, who would become head of the Houston center, said about their senior senator, Harry Flood Byrd, a conservative Democrat, ''What has Mr. Byrd ever done for the space program?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kraft said he and the other engineers soon came to love the Houston area, adding, ''The people went out of their way to make sure we were happy here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin, in an interview, said NASA had simply learned to live with hurricanes. ''We have a lot of facilities in the Southeast,'' he said. ''The Southeast is vulnerable to hurricanes. That's not news.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role of politics in placing space facilities did not mean the decisions were bad ones, Mr. Griffin said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can always say that politics was a factor,'' he said, ''but even from a perspective of 40 or 50 years now removed from when these centers were put where they were put, they were good decisions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, ''we just have to live with hurricane risks,'' he said, adding, ''When it comes time to upgrade facilities, we're going to have to try to harden things.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Scheuermann, the chief operating officer of the Michoud plant in New Orleans, said: ''Obviously, we are where we are, and we're always going to be susceptible to hurricanes. We're going to have to be prepared as well.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 12 -- Two astronauts ventured on Wednesday into the cargo bay of the space shuttle Discovery and tested techniques that might be used to make emergency repairs to a shuttle's heat shield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts, Piers J. Sellers and Lt. Col. Michael E. Fossum, stepped into space with caulk guns and putty knives, and made their way to the back of the cargo bay to work on heat shield samples brought up in a cargo box. It was their third and final spacewalk since the shuttle docked with the International Space Station on July 6 for a 13-day mission.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers and Colonel Fossum applied an experimental compound for fixing heat shield damage, and took videos with an infrared camera designed to spot heat shield cracks that might be too small to be seen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalk, which lasted 7 hours 11 minutes, went 41 minutes longer than planned so the astronauts could attach equipment to the space station that could be used for future construction on the outpost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tony Ceccacci, mission flight director at the Johnson Space Center, said at a news conference here that the spacewalk was a success, although it was tiring for the Discovery crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tomorrow, the crew's going to get a well-deserved day off,'' Mr. Ceccacci said. ''They'll be doing the standard: looking out the window.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two spacewalkers spent most of their time working on samples of the carbon composite material that lines the shuttle's nose and the leading edges of its wings, material designed to withstand the hottest re-entry temperatures, which approach 3,000 degrees. The hard but brittle heat protection material, called reinforced carbon carbon, is the kind that was damaged by launching debris on the shuttle Columbia three years ago, leading to the loss of the craft and its seven-member crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has focused on keeping debris from falling from the shuttle's external fuel tank at launching. Major damage to the heat shield would require abandoning the shuttle while the crew took refuge in the space station for later rescue, agency officials said. But NASA has also developed techniques and materials for repairing the tiles and the carbon composite panels that shield the shuttle if they suffer minor damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers and Colonel Fossum focused on applying a special putty to cracked and gouged samples of the composite material to see how it would work in weightlessness and at a range of temperatures in space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They used special caulking guns filed with a sticky, black material that has the consistency of peanut butter and that the space agency calls NOAX, for nonoxide adhesive experimental.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crews of the shuttle and the space station received a late morning private call from Mr. Bush, who said he had seen part of a Monday spacewalk in which the astronauts repaired a remote-controlled sled that crosses rails atop the station, and wanted to thank them for their service to the country. He also invited the Discovery crew and their families to visit the White House after the mission, a White House spokesman said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials and astronauts also said that they were feeling good about the success of the Discovery's mission so far, and believed that the shuttle program was ready to resume the task of completing the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle appears to have come through launching with little or no damage, evidence that the time and expense of many modifications had worked, Anthony J. Ceccacci, the mission's lead flight director, said at a news conference here at the Johnson Space Center. In addition, two successful spacewalks by the Discovery astronauts put the station in shape for continued expansion on future missions, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives everybody a really good feeling that we're getting there,'' Mr. Ceccacci said. ''It's time to get going and start building the station.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts voiced the same confidence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My brother put it very well,'' the shuttle pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly, told The Associated Press in an interview from space, describing a telephone conversation with his twin and fellow astronaut Scott Kelly. ''He said 'We're back, baby!' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts Piers J. Sellers and Lt. Col. Michael E. Fossum checked their spacesuits to prepare for Wednesday's spacewalk, in which they will enter the shuttle's cargo bay and test materials that might be used to repair damage to the hard, black material that protects the nose and wing leading edges from the hottest heat of re-entry. A case in the bay contains samples of this composite material, called reinforced carbon carbon, and an assortment of plugs and special putty that might be used to seal small cracks and abrasions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Columbia was destroyed on Feb. 1, 2003, while returning from a mission because of damage to this material on a wing caused by pieces of insulating foam that fell from the shuttle's external fuel tank and struck it during launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacewalkers are also expected to test a special infrared camera to see if it can pick up small cracks in the reinforced carbon carbon that be invisible to the human eye. It is hoped that the heat-detecting camera can find distortions in surface temperature that could indicate cracks that might need to be sealed or smoothed with a repair material.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Columbia disaster, NASA has been testing experimental methods that might be used in space to repair minor damage to a shuttle's heat shield, if found. Major damage would require abandoning the shuttle while the crew took refuge in the space station for later rescue.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The walk, to repair parts of the space station, began at 8:14 a.m., Eastern time. The astronauts, Michael E. Fossum and Piers J. Sellers, completed their work and, sounding thoroughly winded, began re-entering the airlock about 2:45 p.m. The spacewalk officially ended at 3:01.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was rigorous. ''This is a beast,'' Mr. Sellers said at one point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task was attaching a bar to part of a pump for the space station so two other astronauts, Lisa M. Nowak and Stephanie D. Wilson, could work inside the station to grab the assembly with the station's robotic arm and move it into position for installation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the bar was in place, Mr. Sellers and Mr. Fossum moved on to the next task: replacing part of a transporter for equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station is only half-built, and continuing the construction requires that the transporter work. The transporter is like a remote-controlled railway car; it has two cables to carry power and data so that if one is damaged, the transporter can still work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA requires that the transporter have two good cables. But a safety device that is supposed to undo snags by cutting a cable fired unexpectedly in December, disabling one of the two cables. The space agency has not yet determined why that happened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their first spacewalk, on Saturday, Mr. Fossum and Mr. Sellers installed a metal device to keep the other cutter from slicing its cable. Monday's spacewalk involved replacing a cable-reeling assembly on what is known as the trailing umbilical system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They removed the old cable-reeling unit, but the spacewalk stretched on as Mr. Fossum struggled to put the new one in place, a task that required more force than is easily applied in a microgravity environment. Mr. Sellers came over to work with Mr. Fossum to wrestle it into place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers, while unlatching the old umbilical assembly, said he was ''going slow here,'' and added, ''Don't want to bump anything expensive.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining that it is, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration did on Sunday, is an arduous process. Even though engineers and analysts say there is really no choice for an agency still climbing back from a horrendous re-entry accident -- the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven on a bright February morning in 2003 -- the level of detail can sometimes seem absurd.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blame the tools that have been developed since the Columbia disaster. They give such stunningly clear and detailed images of the shuttle from orbit that there are endless new problems to worry about.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, mission managers announced results of their close look at every suspicious mark and irregularity on the shuttle surface, including stiff bits of cloth called gap fillers that were poking out of the underbelly, as well as loosened patches on insulating blankets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Columbia, such problems would have probably not been noticed. Now, each becomes a potentially troubling issue, to be dealt with one by one by one by one. On Sunday, the sixth day of the 13-day flight, Steve Poulos, the orbiter projects office manager, said every item had finally been checked off.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not only did the team pound these issues flat,'' Mr. Poulos said. ''They put a dimple in the board when it was all said and done.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also pondered an octopus-shape black mark on the leading edge of the right wing that turned out to be soot from the craft's small rockets and a suspicious white mark that appeared to have a black center that turned out not to be a dangerous ding, but dung. Or, more precisely, bird droppings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it seems like a bit much, NASA managers remind reporters that re-entry is unforgiving, and the loss of the Columbia is still all too fresh. They point out that the analysis took far less time than on the Discovery mission a year ago and that NASA is developing techniques to quickly discern potential hazards from mere schmutz.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Camps on Foam   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Discovery was launched last Tuesday, the chief safety officer and the chief engineer of NASA recommended that the mission be delayed until more work could be done to resolve the problem that doomed the Columbia and plagued last year's return-to-flight mission, foam falling from the external tank at liftoff. They were overruled by the agency administrator, Michael D. Griffin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now managers are exulting over the remarkable lack of damage to the orbiter. But some of those who had suggested delay pointed out that foam did, in fact, fall off, including a patch larger than 12 by 14 inches.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both sides can claim victory on this,'' said an engineer who favored a delay and who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about internal NASA activities. The engineer added, ''It's just like politics.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the cautious camp, he said, ''we'll say we had a major foam loss'' and push for more work to be done. But the other side could say, ''Everything's beautiful.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a briefing with reporters on Saturday, the deputy manager of the shuttle program, John Shannon, sought the middle course.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm fairly confident that we will never finish redesigning the external tank,'' Mr. Shannon said. Until the program ends in 2010, he added, ''we're going to be in a state of continual improvement.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggie Jokes   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michael E. Fossum struggled with a tether on Saturday on his spacewalk and found he had not noticed that it was in the locked position, many Texans had a two-word explanation -- Aggie astronaut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggies are students at Texas A&amp;M University, and they have long been the butt of dumb-guy jokes across the state. A sample: Aggie scientists announce plans to launch a mission to explore the surface of the sun. ''But the ship and anyone in it will burn up!'' other scientists exclaim. ''Shows how much y'all know,'' the Aggies respond. ''We're going at night.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fossum, as it happens, is the first person with an undergraduate degree from A&amp;M to reach space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a news conference on Saturday when the manager of spacewalks for the mission, Thomas Gonzales-Torres, was asked whether there had been Aggie jokes. ''I think there will be some now,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reporter asked Mr. Fossum on a video link, ''After the locked-tether incident yesterday, have you heard any new Aggie jokes?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts broke into raucous laughter, and Mr. Fossum smiled. ''Oh, real fine,'' he replied. ''I guess I knew that was coming.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Than One Entendre   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has a language all its own, a jumble of jargon, euphemism and colorfully geeky terms that make commonly used phrases somehow end up sounding surreal or even vaguely indecent. The spacewalk in which two astronauts rode on the robot arm and boom extender and simulated motions for inspection and repair to check wobble and sway was called ''bouncing on the boom.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space to transfer materials is the ''bungee jail.'' A gap filler with a rounded top peeking out was named the ''tadpole gap filler,'' and the infamous guano was ''surface deposit'' or a ''surface artifact.'' Reporters for Agence France-Presse used ''fiente,'' which sounds almost elegant.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 8 -- Two astronauts from the shuttle Discovery took a seven-and-a-half-hour walk outside on Saturday, doing a bit of repair work to a malfunctioning part of the International Space Station and testing whether the shuttle's robot arm and sensor boom can be used as a work platform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts, Piers J. Sellers and Michael E. Fossum, began easing out of the space station's Quest airlock at 9:17 a.m. Eastern time and returned at 4:48 p.m.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on the ground, mission managers continued to examine questionable spots on the shuttle's exterior to decide whether any of them constituted a threat to the craft and crew in the shuttle's fiery re-entry through the earth's atmosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have cleared all but two of what mission managers called ''regions of interest,'' Steve Poulos, the space shuttle orbiter projects manager, said during an afternoon briefing at the Johnson Space Center here. ''Yesterday, things were a little fuzzy,'' he said, ''and today, things are a lot more clear.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysts, he said, are still examining a stiff piece of cloth, known as a gap filler, that is poking from the belly of the shuttle toward the back of the craft. Gap fillers that poke up between tiles might disrupt the flow of superheated gases over the shuttle and cause uneven heating. But high-resolution photographs showed that the gap filler was likely to lay flat during re-entry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another area under examination, a bit of insulating blanket near a window on upper surface of the orbiter that appears to be slightly out of place, will probably be cleared within 24 hours as well, Mr. Poulos said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other marks on wing panels now appear, under closer inspection, to be harmless drips of hydraulic fluid or sooty stains from the exhaust of the motors that pushed away the solid rocket boosters. A spot on the nose of the vehicle, under close examination, turned out to be bird droppings -- or, as Mr. Poulos put it, a ''surface deposit.'' Over all, Mr. Poulos said, ''This is the best, cleanest orbiter I've seen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of damaging foam debris in the Discovery's liftoff does not mean that the space program can claim victory, said John Shannon, the deputy manager of the shuttle program. ''Now that we're so sensitive to the state of the foam,'' he said, ''we're going to look for continuous improvement.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task for the spacewalkers, fixing a small railway car on the outside of the station that transports equipment, involved making sure that the power and data cable to the transporter was safe. The transporter has two sets of the cables, with one as a backup. But in December, the transporter's cable cutter, a safety device for overcoming snags, cut one of the cables.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA still does not know why it malfunctioned, but managers of the space station wanted to keep the other cutter from sabotaging its cable, since the transporter is essential for completing construction on the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attempt to block the cutter with a bolt on a previous spacewalk by the space station crew was unsuccessful, but Mr. Fossum was able to install the blocker on this walk. A second step to restoring the transporter will come on Monday, when the astronauts will replace the cut cable and assembly on the other side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts then moved on to the second task, testing the use of the 50-foot extension to the Discovery's 50-foot robot arm as a work platform for shuttle inspection and repair. The astronauts attached a work platform to the end of the boom and then took turns riding on the platform, mimicking motions that they would make during repairs to the shuttle. Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration called this process ''bouncing on the boom.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lead flight director for the mission, Anthony J. Ceccacci, said that his team was pleasantly surprised to find that the boom stopped its swaying in 20 seconds or less, not the 60 seconds they had predicted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hopefully, we'll never have to use it,'' he said, ''but we know we'll have the capability if we do need to.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the fourth spacewalk for Mr. Sellers, and the first for Mr. Fossum. Inside the shuttle, Lisa M. Nowak and Stephanie D. Wilson operated the robotic arms for the shuttle and the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems with balky tethers, which hold astronauts to the shuttle while they move around, caused delays. ''We had problems with almost every tether we touched today,'' the mission's lead officer for spacewalks, Thomas Gonzales-Torres, said at the briefing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the spacewalk may have lacked in drama it made up for in humor. The astronauts outside traded quips with those inside the shuttle, and dealt with obstacles with sheepish amusement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Fossum moved to take Mr. Sellers's place on the robot arm, his safety tether stubbornly refused to retract. Engineers on the ground worked through the problem and, stumped, finally asked the astronauts to get a spare tether -- but, just before sending them to retrieve it, asked one more thing. ''We want to just make sure it's in the unlocked position,'' came the message from earth. The astronauts checked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sellers said, ''It's in the locked position.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fossum exclaimed, ''No!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, no!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, radioed back to mission control, ''Thanks for that recommendation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chagrined Mr. Fossum said, ''Oh, that's pretty embarrassing.''  </p>

In the morning packet of messages and instructions sent up to the shuttle, mission managers joked that the exercise "Sounds like a new country song."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task involved making sure that the power and data cable to the transporter were safe.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said that the shuttle came through the rigors of ascent in a remarkably clean state and that they had narrowed their analysis to a few unresolved issues.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news briefing on Friday, Steve Poulos, the space shuttle orbiter projects manager, said analysts were still examining two blemishes on the hard panels that line the leading edge of the right wing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poulos added that teams were continuing to work through questions about a piece of stiff cloth known as a gap filler, which sits between tiles so they do not rub against each other as the shuttle flexes. The filler is poking out from the underside of the craft, toward the rear; a similar piece near the nose was removed by a spacewalking astronaut during the Discovery's mission last summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are also trying to determine whether a blemish on the nose of the vehicle was a weakened spot, Mr. Poulos said, or something as harmless as bird droppings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. Poulos nor John Shannon, the deputy shuttle chief and leader of the mission management team, appeared to be worried about any of the three issues, though they said they were withholding judgment until the analysis was complete.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't rule out anything until the analysts come out and say it's not a problem,'' Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the briefing, the officials also announced that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had decided to extend the mission by a day to add a third spacewalk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mission managers do decide to have an astronaut remove the gap fillers, that bit of maintenance would take place during the added spacewalk, on the ninth day of the mission. The walk, which mission planners had long considered but which depended on the condition of the shuttle's fuel cells, will be devoted to testing repair techniques that the space agency is developing for the shuttle's delicate insulating tiles and panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first spacewalk of the mission will take six and a half hours starting Saturday morning and will involve repairs to a minirailcar system on the outside of the station that transports equipment. In another experiment on the first spacewalk, two astronauts, Piers J. Sellers and Michael E. Fossum, will ride at the end of the shuttle's robot arm and extension boom, which together stretch 100 feet, to get a feel for the swaying and bouncing that might occur during a repair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is too much motion, NASA engineers may have to come up with another solution, like a platform that could be temporarily attached to the outside of the shuttle, to support repair work, Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a midday briefing, Anthony J. Ceccacci, the lead flight director for the mission, said it would be premature to try to use the first spacewalk to remove the gap filler until the characteristics of riding on the boom were well understood.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach, at a gradual one-tenth of a foot per second as both craft raced through orbit at 17,500 miles an hour, could be seen on NASA Television from a camera mounted in the Discovery's docking mechanism.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capture confirmed,'' the shuttle's commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, radioed to mission control at 10:52 a.m. Eastern time, when the two spacecraft joined about 220 miles above Earth, south of Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific. By 12:30 p.m., the crews had opened the hatch separating them and exchanged handshakes and hugs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour before docking, the Discovery, in its second full day in orbit, did a back flip of greeting as it approached the space station. During the maneuver, in which Colonel Lindsey pulled up the nose of the craft at three degrees per second, the 122-foot-long, 245,000-pound shuttle turned as gracefully as a gymnast, though an extremely large one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gave crew members on the station, Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia and Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the United States Army, the flight engineer, a leisurely view of the bottom of the Discovery so they could take 350 highly detailed photographs of it. The flip was part of the program of inspection put in place after the 2003 Columbia disaster, when an undetected hole in the left wing caused that shuttle to break up during re-entry, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was only the second time that the maneuver had been performed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey executed the maneuver with the help of a small thruster, known as a Vernier, that developed a balky thermostat last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem had threatened to delay the mission, but NASA elected to launch without fixing the thruster, saying the astronauts could maneuver without it. Once in orbit, Colonel Lindsey kept the left side of the shuttle facing the sun, which warmed the craft and brought the thruster up to operating temperature.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coast of Spain was clearly visible beneath the Discovery as the maneuver began, and the hills and clouds slid by underneath.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut aboard the Discovery, officially joined the station's crew, bringing its complement to three for the first time since the Columbia disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony J. Ceccacci, the lead flight director for the mission, said at an afternoon briefing for reporters that the mission was going according to plan -- so much so, in fact, that it threatened to become a bit dull.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's boring to us that it's quiet,'' he said. ''But that's a good thing. That means everything is going well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, mission managers will be discussing several issues. Two pieces of stiff cloth that fit between tiles, which are known as gap fillers, are poking up from between tiles on the left wing and toward the rear of the shuttle. Since any protruding object can cause unusual heating during re-entry, the managers will discuss whether the fillers constitute a threat and need to be removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, noted that a breakaway patch of thin foam that he described yesterday as being 8 inches by 10 inches was actually more than 12 by 14. That larger patch was still within the range that the agency expected to see, Mr. Shannon said, and did not constitute a threat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the shuttle crew will transfer an Italian-made cargo carrier, known as Leonardo, from the shuttle to the station so that the 5,000 pounds of supplies inside can be loaded into the station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the early afternoon briefing on Thursday, Mr. Ceccacci also talked about Mr. Reiter's ''seat liner,'' the soft shell that is tailored to the astronauts' bodies so they are not injured on the rough ride back to Earth. It was transferred to the space station along with him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When reporters asked Mr. Ceccacci whether the lack of seat liners for the shuttle astronauts meant that they could not return to Earth on a Soyuz in case of orbiter damage, he said that in an emergency, other options always emerged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll tell you what,'' he said. ''I'd take the chance. I'd wrap myself in bubble wrap if I had to to get home safely.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON, July 5 -- NASA engineers and managers expressed optimism Wednesday that the shuttle Discovery had come through its ascent to orbit with no damage and substantially less shedding of foam debris from the external tank than in previous flights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are very excited that they have not been surprised by anything,'' said John Shannon, shuttle deputy program manager, after a briefing with reporters.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this second day of its mission, the shuttle raced to catch up with the International Space Station, which it is scheduled to dock with on Thursday at 10:52 a.m. Meanwhile, the astronauts began their detailed inspection of the spacecraft for possible damage and managers revealed detailed photographs of the external tank after it had been set loose from the ascending craft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crew members released the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm and used a package of sensors and cameras on the end to check heat shield material on the craft's nose and wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shannon said that all of the examinations so far had been preliminary, and that far more data would be collected over the next few days as more examinations of the craft followed. On Thursday, for example, the space station crew will take detailed photographs of the shuttle's belly as the craft approaches the station at close range and does a 360-degree pirouette, known as the rotational pitch maneuver.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Shannon blended a measure of caution into the briefing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't seen anything yet,'' he said, ''but the rotational pitch maneuver is going to tell us a whole bunch about the condition of the exterior of the vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was only the second time astronauts have done such a detailed inspection of the outer hull of a shuttle after launching; the first was during the Discovery's flight a year ago to check safety modifications ordered since the Columbia accident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbia disintegrated on Feb. 1, 2003, while returning to Earth because of damage to a wing caused by pieces of insulating foam that fell from the external fuel tank and struck the shuttle during launching. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration then grounded the shuttle fleet and spent more than $1 billion to redesign the orbiters, focusing on stopping large chunks of foam from breaking away during launchings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some large pieces fell off during the Discovery's flight last year, prompting more redesign and delay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several areas on the external tank did lose some foam, Mr. Shannon said, including an area about the size of a sheet of notebook paper that appeared to have peeled off in six pieces. But the foam in that area was too thin for the pieces to have significant mass, he said, and they fell off later in the mission than the time when the agency considers such events hazardous to the ship.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several areas that had shed foam in the past and that had been redesigned did not shed foam this time, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues have cropped up in the early evaluations that appear to be minor, officials said. The photographic sweep revealed that a single strip of stiff felt known as gap filler that sits between insulating tiles was found to be poking out underneath one of the shuttle's wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In last year's flight, a gap filler near the nose of the craft caused concern about the possibility that it might cause uneven heating downstream on the craft, and the astronaut Stephen Robinson removed it during a spacewalk. This gap filler does not appear to be in an area that would lead to similar concern, Mr. Shannon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tony Ceccacci, the lead flight director, said at a Wednesday afternoon news briefing that a pattern of unusual white stains had been seen on the shuttle's right wing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ceccacci said that he had seen the splotch in images and that he had seen similar white markings in the same place while inspecting the shuttle on the ground three weeks ago. He added that seen from a distance of 10 feet or so, the markings looked like bird droppings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't touch anything, if that's what you're asking,'' Mr. Ceccacci said to the amusement of reporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagery experts will study the stain and make a final determination, he said. If the markings are bird droppings, he said, they will burn off during the Discovery's fiery return from space.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 4 -- The space shuttle Discovery split a nearly cloudless sky with thunder and fire on Tuesday afternoon and roared safely into orbit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liftoff, right on schedule at 2:38 p.m., was the start of a 13-day flight that is the first in a year for the diminished shuttle fleet as NASA continues its efforts to resume more frequent human spaceflight.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is to rendezvous on Thursday with the International Space Station, where it is carrying equipment, supplies and a fresh astronaut for the station's crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is also considered the second and final test flight for the shuttle fleet since the loss of the Columbia and its seven astronauts in 2003, and the Discovery's ascent was scrutinized for the kind of liftoff debris that caused that disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 2 minutes 53 seconds into the flight, an onboard camera showed numerous pieces of debris appearing to fall away from the external fuel tank. They fluttered away and did not appear to strike the shuttle, carrying a crew of seven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">N. Wayne Hale Jr., NASA's shuttle program chief, said the pieces had fallen ''after the time we are concerned about,'' after the air becomes so thin that debris usually floats harmlessly away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A piece of debris that broke off later in the ascent did appear to strike the midbody of the orbiter, NASA officials said. But they added that it probably did not do any damage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, officials said, insulating foam broke away from five spots on the external fuel tank and a solid rocket booster, some with several pieces of foam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none occurred within the time that NASA considers hazardous, and only one piece might be larger than the allowable size. Batteries of cameras on the Discovery and the space station are photographing every square inch of the shuttle's surface during the mission. If serious damage is found, NASA plans call for the crew to abandon the shuttle and seek ''safe haven'' inside the station until a rescue mission can begin .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials were jubilant about the liftoff. ''They don't get much better than this,'' said NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, who had been criticized for overruling engineering and safety officials last month after they recommended postponing the mission for more study of debris hazards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he felt vindicated, Mr. Griffin replied that the successful liftoff simply represented good, solid engineering.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We keep coming back to feelings, you know,'' he said. ''I'll have time for feelings after I'm dead. Right now we're busy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally scheduled for last Saturday, the Discovery's liftoff had been delayed twice by threatening weather. But the Fourth of July dawned with bright skies that all but guaranteed launching, though there were concerns about crosswinds in the hours before liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the moment of liftoff neared, NASA's launching director, Michael D. Leinbach, polled the shuttle's support teams for their approval to launch. All gave it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery is ready,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''The weather is beautiful, and America is ready to return to space. Good luck and godspeed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle's commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force, responded, ''I can't think of a better place to be than here on the Fourth of July.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey then addressed the thousands of spectators along the coast, saying he hoped to give them ''a close and personal look at the rockets' red glare.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the engines and boosters lifted the craft with a roar into a sky so clear that the flames were visible even when the shuttle had risen more than 60 miles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main engines cut off, as planned, at the eight-and-a-half-minute mark, the moment that those familiar with the dangers of ascent are finally able to take a full breath. Soon after, the external tank was released and fell away toward the ocean, and the craft resumed its course toward the space station.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has had a long road back from the Columbia disaster, when the nation's oldest shuttle broke up over Texas and Louisiana on Feb. 1, 2003, as it returned to the Florida landing strip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation of the accident found that a 1.67-pound piece of insulating foam had punched a hole in the left wing during the ascent and, moreover, that a ''broken safety culture'' at NASA had let schedule and budget pressures overcome safety concerns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, NASA has worked on correcting both problems. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on eliminating sources of foam debris from the external tank, and the agency took steps to ensure that dissenting voices were heard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year ago, during the Discovery's return-to-flight mission, the external tank shed less foam than before, but several pieces did fall, one weighing nearly a pound.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did no damage but led the space agency to hold off flying until the problem was better understood and corrected. NASA removed 35 additional pounds of foam from the tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, engineering and safety officials recommended against launching because tests showed that small amounts of foam might fall off the ramps that cover brackets along the length of the tank. That insulation protects against ice and frost that build up as humid air condenses on the outside of the fuel tank and is frozen by the supercooled fuel inside it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers had said a ''catastrophic'' foam strike was ''probable'' at some point over 100 shuttle missions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Griffin overruled the managers, saying he disagreed with those characterizations. He noted that the chief risk was to the vehicle and not the crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three shuttles remaining in the national fleet are scheduled to fly 16 more missions to complete work on the half-finished space station; a flight may be added to service the Hubble Space Telescope. President Bush has called for retiring the shuttle fleet by 2010, so NASA will have to return to its historic average of 4.5 missions a year to reach the goal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the day of maintenance between the first two attempts and Tuesday's liftoff, the discovery of damaged foam on a bracket that secures the liquid oxygen fuel line to the external tank led engineers to spend a day of intense study and discussion before deciding that the foam did not constitute a risk to the craft or crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once in orbit, one astronaut, Michael E. Fossum, radioed mission control in Houston to report that the crew had spotted what appeared to be a strip of fabric as long as six feet floating away from the Discovery, about 15 minutes after liftoff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really looked a lot like the FRSI insulation,'' Mr. Fossum told the managers, referring to part of the heat-resistant blankets that cover the top of the orbiter. (The acronym, pronounced ''frizzy,'' stands for flexible reusable surface insulation.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA managers determined that it was not insulation but harmless ice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is to continue testing scores of modifications made since the loss of the Columbia, including ways to inspect and repair potential damage to the shuttle's heat shield. On the way to the station, the astronauts are to spend most of their second day in space using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, with a 50-foot boom tipped with a camera and laser imager, to inspect heat-protecting materials on the orbiter's underside, nose and wings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the third day of flight, the shuttle will approach the station for docking. Before the linkup, Colonel Lindsey will stop the craft about 600 feet away and perform a back-flip maneuver to pitch the 100-ton orbiter nose-up, allowing the station crew to take detailed pictures of the bottom with still cameras.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week of joint operations are planned. The Discovery will transfer tons of supplies and new equipment carried in an Italian-made module called Leonardo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will feature two spacewalks, and possibly three. The first two will involve station repairs and adding equipment. If controllers determine that the Discovery has enough power and oxygen for an extra day at the station, the astronauts will venture out for a third time to test experimental methods that might be used to repair potential damage to the shuttle's wing and nose heat shields.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said Tuesday that they hoped to launch Atlantis as early as Aug. 28 to resume space-station construction.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparently successful launch of the shuttle Discovery is cause for restrained jubilation. The astronauts are not out of danger yet. Only further inspections will tell whether their fragile vehicle sustained any significant damage on ascent. Even before takeoff, inspectors discovered a piece of damaged foam insulation -- the threat that most troubled NASA. But engineers decided it was not a risk to either the ship or its crew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The striking thing about this shuttle flight is that the most important task is simply survival -- of both the vehicle and the astronauts who are riding in it.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program has been brought to this state by the disastrous loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and the failure to fully eliminate the foam-shedding problem that caused that accident, despite three years of trying. In recent weeks, NASA decided to go ahead with the launch anyway so as to get started on the remaining 16 flights needed to complete the international space station before the aging shuttles are retired for good in 2010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This flight will be full of mundane tasks that are vitally necessary to the space station project. The shuttle will carry up a new crew member for the station. He will join the two on board, who are serving as minimal caretakers but are unable to devote much time to research. Discovery will also unload tons of supplies and equipment for the station and will haul back tons of accumulated trash. Two astronauts will venture outside the shuttle to perform repair and maintenance on the station. All these activities should inject a little more life into the moribund station, which has been limping along on short rations since the Columbia disaster grounded its main supply line.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By far the most important work on this flight involves ensuring the survival of the crew. Should any damage be found that would prevent returning to Earth, the astronauts would be transferred to the crowded space station to await rescue by another shuttle or by Russian space vehicles. The astronauts might conceivably try to repair the damage in orbit, although that seems less likely given the rudimentary capacity for such repairs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their scheduled activities include testing the stability of the long extension boom as a platform for shuttle repairs and, if there is time, testing methods to repair damaged shield segments in space. The astronauts are clearly only learning how to repair a damaged shuttle and may not be ready to do it in a crisis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of the shuttle program may depend on whether Discovery returns to Earth safely. Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, has said he would try to shut the program down if another vehicle is lost. That would end all hope of completing the space station and of sending up a final mission to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most productive scientific instrument.   </p>

Residents with telescopes in the United States and Canada had the best view of the asteroid, 2004 XP14, which appeared as a streaking dot in the northern sky. Judging by its brightness, 2004 XP14 was estimated to be a quarter-mile to a half-mile wide. An asteroid that size, if it smashed into Earth, would probably cause regional destruction. Scientists have said it would take an asteroid a mile wide or larger to cause widespread devastation that could threaten civilization. Asteroid encounters are not uncommon.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're 'go' to continue with the launch countdown,'' said William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for space operations.'' Liftoff was set for 2:37 p.m.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small piece of foam insulation, which fell off a bracket that holds a fuel line in place, weighs less than one-tenth of an ounce, about as much as a penny, and would not have caused serious damage to the shuttle if it had fallen off during ascent, said John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers and officials spent the day trying to determine, among other things, whether the remaining foam would stay in place and whether the missing foam might cause ice to form on the bracket that could fall and damage the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an afternoon briefing with reporters at the Kennedy Space Center, John Chapman, the external tank manager, said the loss of some foam did not automatically mean that the vehicle was unsafe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the decision is likely to raise concerns among those who worry that the space agency has let safety standards slip in the face of pressure to launch the shuttle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerstenmaier said ''launch fever'' was not part of the decision. ''We've laid out the data,'' he said. ''We've looked at it calmly. We're ready to go fly because we're ready to go fly. We're not ready to fly because of some launch window, or some other condition.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent briefings, NASA officials have suggested that some reporters had overblown the risks of shedding foam, especially in the broader context of the risks of space flight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mass of a piece of foam from the tank is small, Mr. Gerstenmaier said in a briefing last week, ''that could be absolutely no concern to us,'' even if the surface area of the lost foam was 85 square inches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Columbia was destroyed on re-entry in February 2003, and its crew was killed, after a much larger piece of insulation, weighing 1.67 pounds, fell and damaged its heat shield. NASA grounded the fleet and spent more than $1 billion trying to correct insulation problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several NASA employees said that in the past a piece of foam of the size that fell from the tank this time would not have raised concerns. The launching has been delayed two times because of the weather.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it would not have gotten as much attention prior to Columbia as it is getting now,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''I think it is a very good thing that we have the sensitivity, and we're looking this close at the vehicle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the afternoon briefing, managers seemed inclined to move toward launching without a close-up inspection, which would have required an extra day. They argued that the inspection team, working 25 feet from the structure that flanks the shuttle, had tools like borescopes that could help examine the tank for damage at a distance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, a plastic pipe extension for the borescope camera allowed an examination to take place from about a foot away, and so several inspectors get a close look. ''We actually got data that's as good or better than we could have gotten by delaying,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the discussion was lively, Mr. Gerstenmaier said, no one on the mission management team or the shuttle astronauts, who were listening in, dissented from the decision. The NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, listened ''intently'' to the discussion, he said, but ''didn't raise any questions or comments.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, Mr. Griffin, overruled his own chief engineer and safety officer, who wanted to delay launching until more work could be done to resolve the foam problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first day of trying to launch the craft, managers decided that it was safe to fly despite problems that would probably have made one of the 44 on-orbit thrusters inoperable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said he was not troubled by the notion that the shuttle might fly with missing foam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Logsdon, a member of the independent board that investigated the Columbia disaster, said, ''Prior to Columbia, we flew 113 times with foam apparently falling off without it hurting us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, he said, NASA did not understand the problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now that we are aware of it and have learned about it,'' he said, ''it's more reasonable to fly with falling foam, because we at least understand the issue better.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The triangular chunk of foam that fell to the launch pad below is about four inches long and looks ''like this small piece of bread crust,'' Mr. Shannon said at the briefing. It was found on a routine inspection, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bracket is designed to allow some movement as the extreme cold of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen shrinks and flexes the tank and the supply line. NASA officials said the rain on Sunday caused ice to form in a nook in the bracket assembly. The ice then pinched the foam when the structure moved, causing the foam to crack and fall off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insulating foam that gives the external fuel tank its eye-catching orange color has been a source of risk and consternation since the beginning of the shuttle program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foam is necessary to prevent ice from forming on the tank, which contains hundreds of thousands of gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Falling ice could damage the shuttle. But as NASA saw from the Columbia disaster, falling foam can be a danger, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the lone shuttle flight since then, by the Discovery a year ago, the shedding of foam was greatly reduced, but pieces did break free that could have damaged the heat shield. That prompted NASA to address the problem again, including removing more than 35 pounds of foam and making other changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery and its crew of seven had planned to take off on a 12-day test flight on Saturday, but the mission was put off to Sunday and then to Tuesday because of storms.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although planets have yet to be definitively detected around Beta Pictoris itself, the first observations of a luminous disk of dust there made scientists in the 1980's think they were seeing conditions like those existing in the planet-forming stage of the early solar system. So they were not too surprised a decade ago when signs of actual extra-solar planets elsewhere started popping up in their telescopes.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Beta Pictoris has revealed another phenomenon that astronomers say may be a typical aspect of planet-forming processes. A fainter secondary dust disk circles the star, possibly betraying the presence of a planet up to 20 times as massive as Jupiter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reported last week that detailed photography by the Hubble Space Telescope showed the existence of two distinct disks around the star. The secondary disk is visible out to more than 24 billion miles from the star and is tilted by about four degrees from the main disk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This confirms what had been suspected before,'' said David A. Golimowski of Johns Hopkins University, a member of the discovery team. ''The two disks suggest that planets could be forming there in two different planes, and this may even be the norm in the formative years of a star system.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was described in the June issue of The Astronomical Journal and in a telephone interview with Dr. Golimowski, the lead author of the journal report. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said the new visible-light images were the best ever taken of Beta Pictoris, a relatively young star at less than 20 million years of age that is 63 light-years away in the southern constellation Pictor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous Hubble photographs had revealed an odd warp in the Beta Pictoris disk, and astronomers speculated that this was actually a separate disk. Computer modeling by scientists at Grenoble Observatory in France offered a possible explanation. The gravitational force of a large planet in an inclined orbit could draw small planetary objects and rocks out of the main disk and align them in the planet's own plane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Golimowski said this was still the best explanation, even though the planet organizing the second disk has so far eluded detection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers suspect that multiple disks of orbiting dust may be common to certain young stars. Recent observations have picked up hints of a double disk around another star. Even the 4.6-billion-year-old Sun, when much younger, might have had planets forming on different planes, which Dr. Golimowski said could explain why the solar system planets are typically inclined to Earth's orbit by several degrees.  </p>

The space agency needed to launch the shuttle by July 19, or wait until late August, because of the amount of daylight required to photograph both the liftoff in Florida and the jettisoning of the external fuel tank over the Indian Ocean; the date was not dictated by the orbital plane of the International Space Station.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We decided to terminate the count today, stand down for 48 hours,'' Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director, told Col. Steven W.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will hold off launching until Tuesday at 2:38 p.m., with the extra day to keep the shuttle astronauts and crews fresh and to replenish the fuel cells, which provide electrical power to the orbiter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topping off the fuel cells on Monday will allow managers to keep an option of extending the 12-day mission by a day, which would be used for a spacewalk to practice repair techniques for the shuttle's delicate tiles and heat panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the decision to delay the mission, John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, said, ''The one thing we really don't control, weather, kept us from launching.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach said NASA could try again on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday before having to shut down operations for three or four days to replenish fuels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time window, dictated by the space center's position in relation to the orbital plane of the International Space Station, closes on July 19. After that, the mission would have to be postponed until late August. The cost of the postponements on Saturday and Sunday, including the price of lost fuels and worker overtime for the weekend and holiday, is about $1 million each, Mr. Leinbach said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weather officer said that Tuesday could be a better day for launching. ''Monday looked very similar to today,'' said First Lt. Kaleb Nordgren of the 45th Weather Squadron of the Air Force. ''On Tuesday, the situation changes. We have much lighter upper-level winds, which decreases the chances of getting thunderstorms.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storms rolled through the area from the morning on. Three and a half hours before the scheduled liftoff, the Kennedy Space Center went into a ''Phase II'' lightning warning, which means lightning has occurred within five miles of the site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission officials remained hopeful, if not optimistic, and had crew members begin the long process of strapping into their seats around noon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postponements due to weather can be difficult for a shuttle crew, said Col. Eileen M. Collins, the commander of the last shuttle mission, a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's disappointing to have a weather scrub,'' said Colonel Collins, who has since retired from the space agency and the Air Force. But she added that the astronauts were too busy to feel much emotion until they were out of the shuttle and heading back to crew quarters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Collins led a mission in July 1999 that was postponed because of thunderstorms. ''You're kind of revved up for the launch,'' she said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topping off the fuel cells on Monday will allow managers to keep an option of extending the 12-day mission by a day, which would be used for a spacewalk to practice repair techniques for the shuttle's delicate tiles and heat panels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the decision to delay the mission, John Shannon, deputy manager of the shuttle program, said, "The one thing we really don't control weather kept us from launching."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach said NASA could try again on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday before having to shut down operations for three or four days to replenish fuels. The current time window, dictated by the space center's position in relation to the orbital plane of the International Space Station, closes on July 19. After that, the mission would have to be postponed until late August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of the scrubs on Saturday and Sunday, including the price of lost fuels and worker overtime for the weekend and holiday, is about $1 million each, Mr. Leinbach said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weather officer said that Tuesday could be a better day for launching. "Monday looked very similar to today," said First Lt. Kaleb Nordgren of the 45th Weather Squadron of the Air Force. "On Tuesday, the situation changes. We have much lighter upper-level winds, which decreases the chances of getting thunderstorms."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storms rolled through the area from the morning on. Three and a half hours before the scheduled liftoff, the Kennedy Space Center went into a "Phase II" lightning warning, which means that lightning has occurred within five miles of the site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission officials remained hopeful, if not optimistic, and the crew began the long process of strapping into their seats at around noon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather scrubs can be difficult for a shuttle crew, said Eileen M. Collins, the commander of the last shuttle mission a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's disappointing to have a weather scrub," said Commander Collins, who has since retired from the space agency. But she added that the astronauts were too busy to feel much emotion until they were out of the shuttle and back in the van to crew quarters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was commander of a mission in July 1999 that was postponed because of thunderstorms. "You're kind of revved up for the launch," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "laying on your back as long as you do can be pretty painful," she went on. "It takes a lot out of you."  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 1 -- NASA scrubbed the launching of the shuttle Discovery minutes before its scheduled liftoff Saturday as threatening clouds encroached on the 20-mile boundary around the Kennedy Space Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The postponement came on the first day of a 19-day launching window, just before the start of a 10-minute span in which the launching pad enters the same orbital plane as the International Space Station.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liftoff is now scheduled for a 10-minute window starting at 3:26 p.m. on Sunday, but current weather forecasts put the likelihood of adverse conditions at 60 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions for Monday, according to forecasters working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, are likely to be even worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-day flight to the space station is to be the second mission for the Discovery since the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven when it broke apart while re-entering the atmosphere on Feb. 1, 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays have always been part of the space program because of the complexity of spaceflight technology and the vagaries of weather.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes at NASA for good weather were high throughout the morning, which dawned bright and relatively clear. Dozens of government officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, came to the space center for the launching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All morning, the issue causing more concern than the weather was a heater for one of the shuttle's six small thrusters that was not operating properly. But mission officials decided to work around that problem and launch anyway, since shuttle pilots are trained to work without all six thrusters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storms are another matter, however, and NASA does not launch when anvil-shaped clouds are near because of the potential for lightning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single anvil cloud began to dissipate before 3 p.m., but others began massing behind it. At 3:15, half an hour before the scheduled liftoff at 3:49, Bruce Buckingham, a NASA spokesman, announced, ''We are still no go for weather.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clouds near the launching site began to dissipate, but clouds massed over the landing strip -- another condition that prohibits liftoff because good visibility there is needed in case the flight is aborted soon after liftoff and the shuttle has to be brought back to the Kennedy landing site. Two minutes before the countdown was to resume, Michael Leinbach, the launching director, decided to delay resuming it to see if the weather would clear before the day's window closed. Though the seven astronauts had been strapped into their seats in the shuttle, with the hatch shut at 2 p.m., the mission managers gave the order to cancel liftoff at 3:42.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach apologized to the commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force. ''Sorry to break your string,'' he said, ''but we're not going to launch today.'' Mr. Leinbach added, ''We're going to try again tomorrow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Lindsey agreed. ''We'll launch when we're ready,'' he said. ''Hopefully, tomorrow will look better.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a brief interview on NASA television, Mr. Leinbach said, ''We played it till the end,'' but ran out of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't control the weather, and we have very strict rules,'' he said. ''It was very disappointing for the entire launch team.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added, ''We're not going to launch the vehicle unless it's safe.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather for Sunday, he said, is also at ''60 percent no-go,'' with a high probability of clouds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, NASA waits a day after two unsuccessful launching attempts to give the astronauts, ground crew and mission controllers the rest that allows them to remain sharp; two more consecutive days of launch attempts would follow. If the shuttle cannot be launched before July 19, the next window opens in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cheney, who was at Cape Canaveral with his wife and three granddaughters, said he was disappointed, according to Reuters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was really looking forward to today, especially looking forward to having my grandkids here,'' he said. ''But it was not to be today. Maybe it will work tomorrow.''  </p>
