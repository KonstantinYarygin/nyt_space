<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm thinking every murder mystery should be set on the moon. A lunar colony is so much more menacing than a snowed-in mansion -- there's no escape, after all, when stepping outside means simultaneously suffocating and freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Gibbs mines this tension to its narrative limits in ''Space Case,'' a delightful and brilliantly constructed ­middle-grade thriller. In the year 2041, scientists are hard at work on a lunar colony, which is alternately exciting and boring for the kids they've dragged along -- until someone winds up dead. Then it's only exciting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our lunar gumshoe, Dashiell Gibson, is an endearing mix of loving and cranky, moody and levelheaded -- in other words, he's 12 years old. In a novel with such a highly imagined plot, a protagonist this layered is a rare treat. At points, Dash convinces us that ''life in outer space sucks.'' But often we see that's just ­posing: He passionately investigates precisely which dehydrated foods are most likely to give him the runs, and confides that ''the forced time with my family is one of the best things about living here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning a scientist mysteriously marches himself out the airlock, and we learn that ''two minutes later he was dead.'' The formidable base commander, Nina Stack, is resolute that the death was an accident. But Dash is less sure -- he overheard an enigmatic conversation, and suspects Nina might be covering up a murder to avoid scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's where the excellence of Gibbs's premise really kicks in. Moon Base Alpha is a distant, sealed place -- its officials control what <span class="companylink">NASA</span> knows, and even if someone on Earth wanted to send up an investigator, it would be incredibly expensive and take weeks. Other kid mysteries strain to keep their young sleuths front and center. On a lunar colony, it's perfectly reasonable that there's no ­police detective to take Dash's case away from him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real fuel in the novel's thrusters is its evident love for science. Far from slowing down the story, passages about the logistics of lunar life form some of the most memorable moments. Over the course of Dash's investigating, morsels about such matters as urine recycling, the lunar day-night cycle, spacesuit radiation shielding and extraterrestrial temperature fluctuations give the book an unexpected plausibility. Ultimately, the murder is secondary: At its heart, ''Space Case'' is about exploration for the sake of exploration, offering up the same wonder as a good long look at the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less prone to lose itself in scientific reverie is Robert Lipsyte's ''The Twin Powers,'' which picks up soon after the end of his 2012 ''The Twinning Project.'' Half-alien twins Eddie and Tom are puzzling how to reach their father, who is locked away in a spaceship at the other side of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers only recently met, as they spent their childhoods on different planets -- one is Earth in 2012, the other a 1958 version. The aliens cloned the Earth and everything on it for their own murky alien reasons but, because of our mismanagement, might now scratch the whole plan and destroy both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''The Twinning Project,'' the intriguing premise of twin planets galvanized the first few chapters but slowed into a fish-out-of-water life swap. In ''The Twin Powers,'' Lipsyte, who was a longtime sports columnist for The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>, makes a welcome turn by bringing together a diverse team of lively friends who are ­resolved to do something, even if they never quite figure out what that is. ­Maybe they'll stop the aliens? Or foil the sinister United States agents on their tail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When ''The Twin Powers'' is in full stride, it offers a compelling portrait of brotherly rivalry, set against dual Americas divided by 54 years of shifting ­culture. But this book's interests are divided too -- the speculative elements feel half-­considered, while the narrative takes on new vigor when it's comparing time periods or discussing Mark Twain, for whom the aliens have a soft spot. It's a book with a lot of interesting things to say, but unclear motives. Dash would never let a suspect get away with hedging like that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet is 20,000 miles in diameter, about two and a half times the size of Earth, and 12 times as massive, putting it into a category of planets called super-Earths that do not exist in our solar system. It is unlivable, circling a star slightly smaller than the Sun about 180 light-years from here in the constellation Pisces at the roasting distance of only 8.4 million miles, less than a tenth of the distance between us and our star.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Life on Mars? Today? The notion may not be so far-fetched after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after reporting that NASA's Curiosity rover had found no evidence of methane gas on Mars, all but dashing hopes that organisms might be living there now, scientists reversed themselves on Tuesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity has now recorded a burst of methane that lasted at least two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, scientists have just two possible explanations for the methane. One is that it is the waste product of certain living microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is one of the few hypotheses that we can propose that we must consider as we go forward,'' said John P. Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists also reported that for the first time, they had confirmed the presence of carbon-based organic molecules in a rock sample. The so-called organics are not direct signs of life, past or present, but they lend weight to the possibility that Mars had the ingredients required for life, and may even still have them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really a great moment for the mission,'' Dr. Grotzinger told a news conference here at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presence of methane is significant because the gas cannot exist for long. Calculations indicate that sunlight and chemical reactions in the Martian atmosphere would break up the molecules within a few hundred years, so any methane there now must have been created recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could have been created by a geological process known as serpentinization, which requires both heat and liquid water. Or it could be a product of life in the form of microbes known as methanogens, which release methane as a waste product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the explanation for the methane turns out to be geological, the hydrothermal systems would still be prime locations to search for signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have always expected that some tiny amount of methane would be found on Mars. Cosmic dust falling on the planet contains organic compounds that are broken up by ultraviolet light from the sun, producing methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new findings, which are described in detail in a paper this week in the journal Science, are a 180-degree flip from a year ago, when mission scientists said that Curiosity had found no signs of methane, placing an upper limit of 1.3 parts per billion by volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the scientists refined their measurements, detecting a background level of 0.7 parts per billion. That is half of what was predicted, raising another mystery that somehow methane is also being destroyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in November 2013, two months after the scientists reported the absence of methane on Mars, the rover measured methane levels 10 times as high. ''It was an 'oh my gosh' moment,'' said Christopher R. Webster of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the lead author of the Science paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The methane levels stayed high through at least the end of January. They subsequently fell, to less than one part per billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier measurement in July had also been high, although it dropped by half a week later, and the margin of error made it unclear what was going on. Curiosity made no methane measurements between July and November 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sushil K. Atreya of the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>, a member of the science team, said it was possible that elevated methane levels lasted from July through January. ''It could have been over six months,'' he said, ''but we don't know that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given its quick appearance and quick disappearance, the newly discovered methane was a relatively small burst, mission scientists suspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, three teams of scientists reported that they had detected methane in the Martian atmosphere -- two using observations from Earth, one using the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Mars Express orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the measurements were at the edge of the instruments' capabilities, and the methane appeared to disappear two years later. If true, that meant not only that was something creating methane on Mars, but also that something else was quickly destroying it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Mars scientists decided that a simpler solution to the methane mystery was that the measurements were mistaken, a conclusion bolstered by the absence reported by the Curiosity team last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Dr. Grotzinger said, ''It's back on the table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael J. Mumma of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who led one of the teams that reported much larger methane plumes in the Mars atmosphere in 2003 based on measurements from Earth -- and has found no methane since 2005 -- said the new data was ''pleasant'' after years of doubts from critics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Curiosity measurements ''confirmed this startling reality that methane is being released, sporadically, and it is being destroyed quickly,'' he said. ''Both events are surprising.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the organic molecules, they showed up in a mudstone nicknamed Cumberland that Curiosity drilled in May 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within Curiosity is a miniature chemistry laboratory that detected significant amounts of the organic molecule chlorobenzene, in much higher concentrations than had been seen in other rocks it had examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists spent months analyzing whether the organic compounds came from Cumberland or contamination Curiosity had brought from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't want to be faked out,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists are still unsure whether Cumberland contained chlorobenzene, which is not a naturally occurring compound on Earth, or if that was the end product of chemical reactions involving other organic molecules in the rock as it was heated. But they convinced themselves that the organic carbon is Martian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In part, Curiosity was built to explore for organics,'' Dr. Grotzinger said, ''and we found them.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new finding, from the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s mission to the little duck-shaped comet called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, appears to eliminate the possibility that the water in Earth's oceans came from melted comets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water vapor streaming off the comet contains a higher fraction of ''heavy hydrogen'' than the water on Earth does, scientists reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That now probably rules out'' comets as the primary source of terrestrial water, said Kathrin Altwegg, a scientist at the <span class="companylink">University of Bern</span> in Switzerland and the principal investigator for the Rosetta instrument that made the measurements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With comets unlikely, most astronomers now think Earth's water came from asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new findings, published in the journal Science, came after Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P in August, close enough for the instrument to begin detailed analysis of the molecules coming off the comet. Earlier, the same instrument discovered that the comet exuded the scents of formaldehyde and rotten eggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a nice start to this phase of the mission,'' Matt Taylor, the project scientist, said of the water findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Earth's water a puzzle, scientists had long presumed that the planet was dry when it formed 4.5 billion years ago, and that the water came later, perhaps during the ''late heavy bombardment'' period more than 3.8 billion years ago. Comets, often called dirty snowballs, seemed a likely candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets originate from two places in the solar system: the Kuiper belt, a ring of icy debris just beyond the orbit of Neptune; and the Oort cloud, a spherical shell of frozen detritus much farther out. Asteroids are rocky bodies in the inner solar system, mostly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But comets' water turned out to be different from Earth's. A few water molecules have a heavier version of hydrogen called deuterium that replaces one of the two hydrogen atoms, forming what is known as heavy water. On Earth, about one in 6,000 water molecules contains deuterium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oort cloud comets, it turns out, have twice the concentration of heavy water found in Earth water. Thus, when the Rosetta spacecraft was launched in 2004, most planetary scientists had already crossed comets off the list of possibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2011, a team using the Herschel Space Observatory, an infrared telescope operated by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, took a look at water vapor from the comet Hartley 2 and found that its deuterium signal perfectly matched Earth's water. That opened the possibility that Earth's water could have come from Kuiper belt comets or those even closer, like Hartley 2, whose orbit does not go much farther out than Jupiter's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people thought that meant comets were back in play,'' said Conel Alexander, a scientist at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new measurements of 67P, another Jupiter-family comet, appear to rule out comets again. Its fraction of heavy water is three times that of Earth, higher than those of the Oort cloud comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ten years ago I would not have been surprised at all by this result, because that's what I expected,'' Dr. Altwegg said. ''But then three years ago we got this Hartley 2 measurement, and that was a real big surprise. Now we're back to what I actually expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the solar system's water, including up to half of Earth's, appears to predate the solar system, formed within expanses of interstellar space billions of years ago. The sun, like the universe over all, has very low levels of deuterium, about one-tenth as much as what is found in Earth's water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, under certain conditions -- cold temperatures along with radiation that knocks electrons from hydrogen -- chemical reactions create water molecules with a much higher fraction of deuterium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published in Science in September, scientists led by L. Ilsedore Cleeves, a graduate student at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>, found that these conditions did not exist in the early solar system, so the high-deuterium water must have been present in the cloud of matter that collapsed to form the solar system. While the outer solar system was cold enough, the radiation was lacking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our paper showed that the outer part of the disk cannot be an engine for creating the deuterium fingerprint,'' said Edwin A. Bergin, a professor of astronomy at Michigan who was another of the paper's authors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent studies on meteorites -- pieces of asteroids that fell to Earth -- paint a very different history of water. Scientists had thought the newborn Earth was dry, because it formed within the solar system's ''snow line,'' where the temperatures are too warm for water ice to exist in the vacuum of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, Dr. Alexander of the Carnegie Institution and his colleagues published a Science paper finding that some types of meteorites, in particular a class of primitive ones that formed beyond the snow line, have deuterium levels similar to Earth's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, in another Science paper, researchers found that meteorites that originated from the large asteroid Vesta, which is believed to have formed inside of the snow line, also possess Earthlike deuterium levels. These scientists believe that ice-rich asteroids from outside the snow line were pushed inward and were among the pieces that combined to form Vesta and Earth hundreds of millions of years before the late heavy bombardment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, Earth may have been wet from almost the beginning.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars changed my life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This happened in the summer of 1965, eight years into what was being called the space age. The American spacecraft Mariner 4 had just flown by Mars and snapped the first fairly up-close photographs of the planet's surface. It was a rare first by the United States in its Cold War space race with the Soviet Union.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was then a writer at Time magazine, charged with producing a weekly page or pages of science news, and this was big news. The 21 grainy black-and-white photographs were a surprise and a disappointment. They showed a bleak landscape of overlapping craters stretching across desolate plains, more like the moon painted red and nothing remotely like the scene of former civilizations of canal builders in science fiction and the minds of more imaginative astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, by noon on a Friday in July, Time's top editors decided Mars deserved the magazine's cover treatment. Our two correspondents at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., were asked to file more on the scientists and engineers and their interpretation of the photographs. How will this change thinking about Mars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I faced a long night writing an article more than three times the length originally planned. I promised the senior editor it would be on his desk when he arrived Saturday morning. There was no slack in this deadline. The magazine went to press Saturday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what did I do first? In the writing tradition, I procrastinated. I rearranged papers on the desk and books on shelves. Thumbed through an old magazine. Checked television listings for programs I would ordinarily not watch but was now dying to see. Anything to put off writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my window on the 24th floor, I watched people in the building across the street. They were leaving their desks for dinner, a movie, a visit to the World's Fair in Queens with out-of-town relatives, or simply easing into an idle weekend. On other occasions, I had counted myself lucky to have escaped their regimented business, whatever it was they did at those orderly rows of desks. Now they seemed the carefree ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, a knock on the door brought the correspondents' first file. Another knock, and I declined an invitation to go out for a drink. Turning from temptation and the window, I read the file and research notes from earlier in the week. I examined the photographs and pondered a drawing of Mariner, the little spacecraft that had traveled millions of miles from home since its launching in late 1964.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars is 140 million miles from the sun, or half again as far as Earth is. The planet is about half Earth's diameter, a cold desert with a reddish hue and the last of the rocky worlds this side of the gas giants in the outer solar system. Its mystique made it a prime destination of space-age investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So began a night alone at the typewriter. I don't recall ever feeling panic or despair. I didn't dare, I suppose. Around 2 or 3 a.m., the offices across the street were dark, the cleaning crews gone. I ducked out for a container of black coffee. Restaurants were closed, the bars thinning out. The nearest deli was down to one counterman yawning over the sports pages. Radio City Music Hall's marquee was dark. The city that never sleeps was nodding off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During this break, I came to a life-changing self-discovery. From an early age, I had seemed hard-wired for a career in journalism but had set my sights on political reporting. (Move over, Walter Lippmann and James Reston.) But now I was writing the kind of story I found endlessly fascinating and satisfying -- the 20th-century version of Columbus's voyage to the New World. Just as Mariner 4 had fired its thrusters to make midcourse corrections to its Mars-bound trajectory, I was ready for a midcourse correction in my career. I would be a science and space journalist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At dawn, I collapsed on the couch in the senior editor's office for a couple of hours of restless sleep. I kept waking up to scribble a note to myself or record a turn of phrase. When the editor, Richard Seamon, arrived, he gave me a wan, questioning smile. Had his writer passed out on the couch, the story unfinished?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I assured him it was nearly done, and in half an hour I handed him the manuscript. It was a patchwork of inserts and emendations that looked messy but, I believed, added up to a narrative worthy of the first successful flight to Mars. Dick's quick reading assuaged his worst concerns. He sent the script to the typing pool to make a clean copy. When I returned after breakfast, Dick flashed the thumbs-up sign. And sure enough, by Monday, millions of copies of my cover story were on newsstands around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month later, I wrote another cover -- on Christopher C. Kraft Jr., the NASA chief flight director, and the new mission control center at Houston -- and while Time seldom used bylines in those days, I was featured in that issue's Publisher's Letter. That proved to be an advertisement for myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reader was Harrison E. Salisbury, the famed foreign correspondent who had become a top editor at The New York Times. He called me the next week and got right to the point. Would I be interested in working for <span class="companylink">The Times</span>? I told him I was happy at Time, especially now that I was writing about science and space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're looking for someone to concentrate on the lunar program,'' Salisbury said. ''We want someone to write about Apollo not as a science and technology undertaking but as a great human adventure, one of the biggest stories of the century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hooked me. I agreed to meet with him and other Times editors. They told me that for various reasons they did not divulge, the paper was still looking for a reporter to entrust with the story of this magnitude. I liked what I heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you were, Lippmann and Reston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I joined <span class="companylink">The Times</span> in November 1965, one day before the lights went out all over New York and much of the Northeast. It was a jolting greeting for the new reporter, who plunged into investigating the causes of the blackout before setting out for the moon, and more encounters with Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later Mariner missions would reveal that the first Mars flyby had left a misleading impression, a reminder to scientists of the fable of the blind men examining an elephant part by part, unable to conceive of the whole. The first spacecraft had looked at 1 percent of the planet. The Mars orbiter Mariner 9 photographed and mapped the entire planet, exposing its amplitude of towering volcanoes, a rift system that dwarfs the Grand Canyon, and dry channels carved out by water in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1976, two Viking landers touched down on widely separated plains of Mars, and two Viking orbiters extended photography of the surface at higher resolutions. More recently, mobile rovers have carried explorations beyond landing sites, over horizons and into distant hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moonwalks of Apollo may have been my biggest stories, but it was the mystique of Mars that changed my career plan in midcourse. Someday, people will find their way to the now well-mapped Mars surface. Others will no doubt jump at the chance to enshrine that arrival for the cover of Time and the front page of The New York Times.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Till ages rolled, the sun shone cold on this unholy place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the planet Mars as channeled by the folk singer and science writer Jonathan Eberhart in ''Lament for a Red Planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli thought he spied lines that he called ''canali'' on Mars in 1877, earthlings' romantic thoughts about our nearest cosmic neighbor have revolved around water and its possible consequence, Life as We Know It. We haven't found life on Mars, but decades of robotic exploration have indeed strengthened astronomers' convictions that rivers and perhaps even oceans once flowed on the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today Mars is an arid, frigid desert, suggesting that the mother of all climate changes happened there, about four billion years ago or so. The question that haunts planetary scientists is why? And could it happen here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the short story is the atmosphere went away and the oceans froze but are still there, locked up in subsurface ice,'' said Chris McKay, an astrobiologist and Mars expert at NASA's Ames Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September a new spacecraft known as Maven, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, swung into orbit around the planet. Its job is to get a longer answer to one part of the mysterious Martian climate change, namely where the planet's atmosphere went.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea is that it was sputtered away by radiation and particles from the sun, known as the solar wind. Maven was designed to test that theory by measuring how fast Mars is losing atmosphere today. The results could help scientists determine what the atmosphere was like four billion years ago, and just how warm and wet the planet was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to get some suggestive answers,'' said Bruce Jakosky, a <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span> professor and principal investigator for Maven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results could resonate beyond Mars or even our solar system, shedding light on the fickle habitability of exoplanets. Alien astronomers looking at our solar system with a good telescope four billion years ago might have concluded that Mars was a likely habitat for life. Now look at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we are learning about are planetary atmospheres in general,'' said David Brain, a Colorado astronomer and Maven team member. ''It's really fascinating to think that the planet changed in such a large way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody agrees that Mars was once wetter, on the basis of two lines of evidence. The surface of the planet is crossed with features that resemble old river channels, like the tributaries and canyons that lead into Chryse Planitia, the Plain of Gold, an ancient crater 1,000 miles wide and a mile-and-a-half deep. And NASA's rovers have found minerals characteristic of watery environments, formed four billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But answers on exactly how wet and warm Mars was -- and for how long -- depend on whom you talk to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to one camp, Mars back then had a thick atmosphere with enough carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas looming big in Earth's future, to warm up the temperature and keep it there for the hundreds of millions of years it would have taken to carve the Martian river system. Others have suggested that phenomena like asteroid impacts or the tilting of Mars's poles could have produced shorter periods of near-freezing temperatures. The impact that created the huge crater called the Hellas basin, for example, would have hurled vast amounts of vaporized rock into the sky -- leading to decades or centuries of hot rain and flash floods, said Brian Toon of the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span>. It might have been followed perhaps by a lingering era of nearly freezing temperatures as clouds left over from the steam bath produced a mild greenhouse effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some geologists question whether the complicated river systems on Mars could have been created in such relatively short episodes, but they admit a serious flaw in their alternative view of a long-lasting greenhouse atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Namely, where did it go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The holy grail of Mars,'' said Dr. Jakosky of the Maven team, is to find the carbonate deposits that should have formed from its atmosphere. ''We haven't found them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is where the new Maven mission comes in. One of the most striking clues that something has happened on Mars has come from atmospheric measurements from previous probes. They have shown that the lighter forms, or isotopes, of elements like hydrogen, nitrogen and argon are strangely depleted by contrast with their abundance on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mars the ratio of heavy nitrogen, which has an extra neutron in its nucleus, to regular nitrogen is twice that of Earth. The same pattern goes for argon, which is Dr. Jakosky's favorite because it is chemically inert and can't disappear from the inventory except by being swept out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Dr. Jakosky said, the isotopic ratios on Mars suggest that about 60 to 90 percent of the atoms that were once in the Martian atmosphere might have been lost to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know the mechanism by which it was lost, but we can't quantify it yet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story goes something like this. Once upon a time, Mars had a magnetic field that, like Earth's, acted as an umbrella, deflecting the rain of energetic particles shed by the sun. Earth's field is generated by a dynamo, which in turn is powered by rising heat, convection in the planet's molten iron core. Once Mars cooled off, the dynamo and the magnetic field stopped and the solar wind began pecking away at Mars's atmosphere. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun would ionize atoms in the upper atmosphere, making them subject to forces from magnetic fields carried along in the solar wind, and they would slip away into space an atom or two at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A little bit every few hours,'' Dr. Brain of Colorado said, and ''suddenly you can change an entire planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually -- with no atmosphere, no rain and none of the tectonic churning that keeps Earth's oceans refreshed -- the Martian rivers and oceans, if any, would have been absorbed into the ground and frozen, said James Kasting, a geoscientist at Penn State. Indeed, orbiting spectrometers have detected the signature of water in the form of ice under the wasted and lonely red sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, after a 10-month trip from Earth and just in time to observe the effects of Comet Siding Spring pass by Mars, Maven began settling into a looping orbit around Mars, flying as close as 77 miles. Its instruments will observe the sun and solar wind; Mars's upper atmosphere, the pool from which escaping particles are drawn; and the particles themselves as they escape. By understanding how the atmosphere is reacting to the sun today, Dr. Jakosky said, scientists should be able to extrapolate and say how much of the Martian atmosphere has been removed to space over the eons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the amount lost is substantial -- ''a couple of bars of CO2,'' he said, describing it in units of the atmospheric pressure on Earth -- ''would tell us that Mars must have been warmer in the past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If losses are trivial, he said, that would spell death for the early greenhouse theory, and the great Martian arguments would continue.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3.5 billion years ago, a meteor slammed into Mars near its equator, carving a 96-mile depression now known as Gale Crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was unremarkable. Back then, Mars, Earth and other bodies in the inner solar system were regularly pummeled by space rocks, leaving crater scars large and small.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was remarkable was what happened after the impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though planetary scientists disagree on exactly what that was, they can clearly see the result: a mountain rising more than three miles from the floor of Gale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More remarkable still, the mountain is layer upon layer of sedimentary rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The layered rock drew the attention of the scientists who chose Gale as the destination for NASA's Curiosity rover, a mobile laboratory the size of a Mini Cooper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, more than two years after arriving on Mars, Curiosity is climbing the mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In sedimentary rock, each layer encases the geological conditions of the time it formed, each a page from the book of Mars' history. As Curiosity traverses the layers, scientists working on the $2.5 billion mission hope to read the story of how young Mars, apparently once much warmer and wetter, turned dry and cold in what John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist, calls ''the great desiccation event.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger remembers the first time he heard about Gale. ''I looked at it, and immediately I'm like, 'This is a fantastic site,' '' he said. ''What's that mountain in the middle?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, the name is Aeolis Mons, but mission scientists call it Mount Sharp in homage to Robert P. Sharp, a prominent geologist and Mars expert at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> who died in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, mountains rise out of volcanic eruptions or are pushed upward by plate tectonics, the collision of pieces of the planet's crust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars lacks plate tectonics, and volcanoes do not spew out of sedimentary rock. So how did this 18,000-foot mountain form?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1990s, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft was sending back images of the Martian surface far sharper than those from earlier missions, like Mariner and Viking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth S. Edgett and Michael C. Malin of Malin Space Science Systems, the San Diego company that built Global Surveyor's camera, saw fine layered deposits at many places on Mars, including Gale. In 2000, they offered the hypothesis that they were sedimentary, cemented into rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Dr. Edgett said, it appeared that Gale Crater had been fully buried with sediment and that later winds excavated most of it, leaving the mountain in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine carving out of an expanse as large as 1.5 Delawares -- a mound as tall, from base to peak, as Mount McKinley in Alaska, the tallest mountain in North America at 20,237 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Edgett asserts that that is plausible on Mars. He points to other Martian craters of similar size that remain partly buried. ''There are places where this did happen, so it's not ridiculous to think this is what happened at Gale,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in 2007 Gale had been discarded from the list of potential landing sites for Curiosity, because observations from orbit did not show strong evidence for water-bearing minerals in the rocks. NASA's Mars mantra for the past two decades has been ''Follow the water,'' because water is an essential ingredient for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger asked Ralph E. Milliken, then a postdoc in his research group at Caltech, to take a closer look at Gale. With data from an instrument on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that can identify minerals in the rocks below, Dr. Milliken showed the presence of clays at the base of Mount Sharp as well as other minerals that most likely formed in the presence of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact we have this mountain, and it's not all the same stuff -- the mineralogy is changing from one layer to the next -- that gives us the hope that maybe those minerals are recording the interaction of the water and the atmosphere and the rocks,'' said Dr. Milliken, now a geologist at Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were water conditions there becoming more acidic? Was there oxygen in the water? ''That's something we can assess with the rover on the ground,'' Dr. Milliken said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its landing on Mars in August 2012, Curiosity took a detour to explore a section named Yellowknife Bay and discovered geological signs that Gale was once habitable, perhaps a freshwater lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, the rover drove to Mount Sharp, with only brief stops for science. To date, the rover, operated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., has driven more than six miles, taken more than 104,000 pictures and fired more than 188,000 shots from a laser instrument that vaporizes rock and dirt to identify what they are made of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Curiosity drilled its first hole in an outcrop of Mount Sharp and identified the iron mineral hematite in a rock. That was the first confirmation on the ground for a Gale mineral that had been first identified from orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Curiosity reaches rocks containing clays, which form in waters with a neutral pH, that will be the most promising place to look for organic molecules, the carbon compounds that could serve as the building blocks of life, particularly if the rover can maneuver into a spot shielded from radiation. (It does not have instruments that directly test for life, past or present.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter also detected magnesium sulfate salts, which Dr. Milliken described as possibly similar to Epsom salts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That layer appears to be roughly as old as sulfates that NASA's older Opportunity rover discovered on the other side of Mars. If Mount Sharp sulfates turn out to be the same, that could reflect global changes in the Martian climate. Or they could be different, suggesting broad regional variations in Martian conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're finally beginning the scientific exploration of Mount Sharp,'' Dr. Milliken said. ''That was the goal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, Curiosity may also turn up clues to the origins of Mount Sharp. While Dr. Edgett thinks Gale Crater filled to the brim before winds excavated the mountain, others, like Edwin S. Kite, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton who is moving to the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> as a professor, think the mountain formed as a mound, with winds blowing layers of sand together that then were cemented by transient water. ''Can you build up a pile like that without necessarily filling up the whole bowl with water?'' Dr. Kite said. ''Perhaps just a little bit of snow melt as the pile grows up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the layers of Mount Sharp dip outward at the edges, as in an accumulating mound; they are not flat, as would be expected if they were lake sediments subsequently eroded by wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger thinks that both could have happened: that Gale Crater partly filled, then emptied to form the lower half of Mount Sharp, and a different process formed the upper portion. A sharp divide between the upper and lower parts of the mountain is suggestive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, during a NASA telephone news conference, Dr. Grotzinger and other members of the science team described new data suggesting long-lived lakes in the crater. The deposits at Yellowknife Bay could have been part of an ancient lake filled by streams flowing from the crater rim. As Curiosity drove toward Mount Sharp, it appeared to be traveling down a stack of accumulated deltas -- angled layers where river sediment emptied into a standing body of water -- and yet it was heading uphill. That pattern could have occurred if the water level were rising over time, and Mount Sharp was not there yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not mean Gale was continually filled with water, but it suggests repeated wet episodes. ''We don't imagine that this environment was a single lake that stood for millions of years,'' Dr. Grotzinger said, ''but rather a system of alluvial fans, deltas and lakes and dry deserts that alternated probably for millions if not tens of millions of years as a connected system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ashwin Vasavada, the deputy project scientist, said that to explain the episodes of a lake-filled Gale crater, ''the climate system must have been loaded with water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But answers will remain elusive. ''We're not going to solve this one with the rover,'' Dr. Edgett said. ''We're not going to solve this one with our orbiter data. We're going to be scratching our heads a hundred years from now. Unless we could send some people there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As successful as the NASA Mars rovers have been, their work is limited and slow. Curiosity's top speed is not quite a tenth of a mile per hour. What might be obvious at a glance to a human geologist, who can quickly crack open a rock to peer at the minerals inside, could take days or weeks of examination by Curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to think it would take only a few months,'' Dr. Edgett said of solving Mount Sharp's mysteries, ''with a few people on the ground.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For lifeless chemical compounds to organize themselves into something alive, scientists generally agree, three sets of things must be present:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Standing water and an energy source.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Five basic elements: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus and nitrogen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its search for environments where life might have started on Mars, the Curiosity rover has found the standing water, the energy and the key elements with the right atomic charges. As a result, scientists have concluded that at least some of the planet must have been habitable long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the period when all conditions were right was counted in hundreds to thousands of years, a very small opening by origin-of-life standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has now changed. John P. Grotzinger of Caltech, the project scientist for the mission, reported at a news conference on Monday that the rover's yearlong trek to Mount Sharp provided strong new evidence that Gale Crater had large lakes, rivers and deltas, on and off, for millions to tens of millions of years. The geology shows that even when the surface water dried up, plenty of water would have remained underground, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the team concluded, numerous deltalike and lakelike formations detected by orbiting satellites are almost certainly the dried remains of substantial ancient lakes and deltas. None of this proves that life existed on the planet, but the case for an early Mars that was ripe and ready for life has grown stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a science team, Mars is looking very attractive to us as a habitable planet,'' Dr. Grotzinger said in an interview. ''Not just sections of Gale Crater and not just a handful of locations, but at different times around the globe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And John M. Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who is NASA's associate administrator for science, said that after almost 28 months on Mars, Curiosity has given scientists insight into how and where to look for clues of ancient life. ''We don't know if life ever started on Mars, but if it did, we now have a better chance of discovering it'' on future missions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another missing piece of the story has been the inability to detect organic compounds -- the carbon-based building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That too may soon change. Last spring, several Curiosity team members reported the detection of some simple organics that appeared to be Martian. The findings were not definitive, but NASA has scheduled a news conference Dec. 14 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union with ''new information'' about the search for organics. ''Our original interpretation -- that there was a good chance the organics we were seeing are Martian -- hasn't changed,'' said Daniel P. Glavin of the Goddard Spaceflight Center, an author of the earlier paper. ''This interpretation will be expanded on at A.G.U.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity does not carry life-detection instruments, in large part because there is no consensus on what such an instrument might be. A finding of life based on what at first appeared to be metabolic activity, detected during the Viking missions of 1977, was so controversial that NASA ultimately rejected it. So scientists have been using a variety of tools -- from geology and other earth sciences, organic and mineral chemistry, atmospheric measurements and sophisticated cameras -- to determine whether life could have arisen and survived in Gale Crater and other locations with similar characteristics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another member of the Curiosity team, Roger Summons of M.I.T., says that findings from that rover and previous missions suggest that early Mars may have been quite similar to early Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first billion years, he said, both planets had stable environments that could support life for substantial periods, and both still share the same chemistry and processes for altering rocks. There is a general scientific consensus that life began on Earth some 3.8 billion years ago, and Dr. Summons said it was clear that the same could have happened on Mars. Or as Dr. Grunsfeld put it, ''What I get excited about is imagining a Mars 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, a planet with a thick atmosphere, maybe a blue sky with puffy clouds and mountains and lakes and rivers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many similarities disappeared after Mars, a much smaller planet, lost much of its protective atmosphere by the end of its first billion years. So searching for possible Martian life involves digging deep below the surface or detecting microbial remains billions of years old. Identifying ancient microbial life has proved extremely difficult and controversial on Earth, and the challenge on Mars is considerably greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, scientists have long called for a mission to bring rock and soil samples back to Earth for sophisticated analysis. The Mars mission scheduled for 2020 would begin the effort by experimenting with methods to select, lift and store promising samples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are no Mars samples now -- except those that arrive as long-traveling meteorites -- so astrobiologists have to conduct their search for life using other methods and teasing out hidden evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for water on Mars, for instance, goes back decades and many missions. But scientists were never certain that the carved canyons and deltas were results of water running long ago, or perhaps lava or frozen carbon dioxide. Because of Curiosity, there is now a wide consensus that early Mars had much water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This conclusion has been difficult to square with climate models, which point to a colder early Mars with a thin atmosphere that could not have supported large bodies of standing water, or rivers that ran for millions of years. But faced with mounting evidence of longstanding water and consequently warmer conditions, the climate scientists have gravitated toward two interwoven explanations -- both with implications for early life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is that frequent volcanoes and meteorite impacts heated the planet substantially; volcanoes also emit gases known to synthesize into organic compounds. The second is that to explain the substantial water cycle required to keep many Martian lakes filled and rivers flowing, the planet needed a substantial ocean in its northern half. Large swaths of Mars north of its equator are one to three miles lower than the so-called southern highlands, and scientists have proposed that an ocean may have filled and molded the vast depression. Others disagree on several grounds, including that no remnant shoreline has been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have hard evidence of a northern ocean, but our models require that much water to explain what the geologists have now confirmed,'' said Michael A. Mischna of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, another Curiosity team member. ''What Curiosity has done is to bring together atmospheric and climate information with the findings of the geologists and geochemists, and created a broad and consistent story of a very wet early Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the evidence for water has become increasingly clear, the question of organic compounds is in flux. Such chemicals fall onto Mars all the time in interstellar dust and meteorites, as they do onto Earth. Yet none have been definitively detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on this mission, team members knew to look for a salt called perchlorate that has been demonstrated on Earth to destroy or transform organics in the presence of heat. Substantial amounts of perchlorate were found in Gale Crater, suggesting that if early Mars had organic chemicals and they survived eons of radiation bombardment, they are long since gone or they will remain very difficult to detect with current techniques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sample Analysis at Mars instrument is designed to identify relatively simple organics that burn off as gases in its oven. But it also carries nine cups with a solvent that can alter more complex molecules (like amino acids and nucleic acids) in ways that protect their signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ''wet chemistry'' has been awaiting the finding of a sample rich in organics. A further problem is that one of its cups leaked, causing enormous headaches and making team leaders wary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Glavin, a member of the team, hopes the spilled solvent will itself be used to test previously collected Martian samples, making it the first wet-chemistry experiment ever on another planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, the search for life on Mars -- past or present -- will be neither straightforward nor swift.</p>

Among the bolder if farther-fetched plans comes from a Dutch nonprofit venture called Mars One, which insists it will land four people on Mars -- two men and two women -- by 2025. As the project leaders see it, the technology needed to reach and colonize the red planet already exists, so why not go ahead and start loading the moving van?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a catch, they say. Where NASA-style flight plans are designed on the Apollo moonshot model of round-trip tickets, the ''one'' in Mars One means, starkly, one way. To make the project feasible and affordable, the founders say, there can be no coming back to Earth. Would-be Mars pilgrims must count on living, and dying, some 140 million miles from the splendid blue marble that all humans before them called home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, enthusiasm for the Mars One scheme has been of middle-school proportions. Last year, the outfit announced that it was seeking potential colonists and that anybody over age 18 could apply, advanced degrees or no. Among the few stipulations: Candidates must be between 5-foot-2 and 6-foot-2, have a ready sense of humor and be ''Olympians of tolerance.'' More than 200,000 people from dozens of countries applied. Mars One managers have since whittled the pool to some 660 semifinalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many space experts and Mars aficionados remain deeply skeptical about the program's odds of success. They point out that Mars One doesn't build rockets or any other aeronautic equipment, as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> does. Nor does it have the tycoon portfolio of Virgin's Sir Richard Branson. ''I don't take Mars One seriously at all,'' said Andy Weir, author of ''The Martian,'' a novel about a stranded astronaut struggling to survive on Mars that is so revered by engineers and techno-space geeks that it has been called ''competence porn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think they honestly believe in what they're doing,'' he added, ''but I don't think they have any chance of accomplishing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others have complained that the group's emphasis on the colonist selection process over financial or technical details of the mission is little more than a publicity stunt. Karen Cumming, 52, a Canadian journalist and teacher who is among the Mars One semifinalists, said she recently met the Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who won fame on the International Space Station by singing David Bowie songs and showing the world how water behaves in low gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told him who I was, and I asked if he had any advice,'' Ms. Cumming said. ''He said: 'Be relentless in your questioning about the hardware. Astronaut selection is the least of their worries.' ''Bas Lansdorp, 37, who conceived of Mars One as an engineering student at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, admitted that its founders sought publicity, but said nobody paid attention when they announced last year that they had formed a partnership with <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choosing the right people for the expedition, he said, is not the least of their worries, but ultimately the only worry. The mission's success or failure hinges on assembling a team of people who can live together in extreme circumstances, he said, ''without losing their minds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The various reasons offered for sending humans to Mars, at a cost of billions if not hundreds of billions of dollars -- ''but less expensive than the war in Iraq!'' insisted Andrew Rader, a Mars One candidate and expert in human spaceflight with a doctorate from M.I.T. -- include elements both practical and profound, optimistic and dystopian. Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, said that for all the success of robots like Curiosity, sending humans to the surface ''may be the only way to prove life evolved on Mars and what the nature of it is.'' And demonstrating that some form of life arose at least twice in our solar system would lend ballast to the argument that the universe teems with life. Humans will soon need more space and more resources than Earth can offer, Dr. Shostak said, adding, ''If you want to have Homo sapiens for the long run, you have to move out somewhere.'' Whatever hardships the Mars homesteaders endure, Mr. Lansdorp argued, may well improve life for those back on Earth. ''We're a species that explores and pushes boundaries,'' he said. ''By exploring our own planet, we've developed technology to make our life more comfortable. Mars is the next logical step, the boundary to push, to make us more developed still.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists agree that of all the places in the solar system where a few expatriate earthlings might settle, Mars is the least hostile. It's roughly one-sixth the size of Earth, but given its lack of oceans, it nearly matches us in landmass. It rotates on an Earthlike tilt of 24 degrees and so has seasons, the length of its day is similar to ours, and its soil is about 2 percent frozen water, which in theory could be melted out and put to use. Its gravity is about 40 percent that of Earth -- enough to keep inhabitants from the severe bone and muscle loss caused by long-term stints in outer space, but still of sufficient levity, said Norbert Kraft, chief medical officer for Mars One, ''that maybe your knees won't hurt and your wrinkles will go away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mars remains a forbidding, frigid place, with an average temperature of minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit and an unbreathable atmosphere just 1 percent the density of Earth's and consisting largely of carbon dioxide. Colonists would live in artificial podlike habitats, grow vegetables in greenhouses and get their protein from insects. No pets, sorry. And if you plan on going outside -- as you will, often, to repair infrastructure battered by the chronic Martian wind, or to wipe off solar panels encrusted with the ubiquitous Martian dust -- you must wear your spacesuit at all times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No more smell of fresh grass, or the ocean,'' Ms. Melroy said. ''Giving that up would be a huge deal.'' Another sacrifice, said Stephan Guenther, 46, a flight instructor and software developer in Cologne, Germany, and a Mars One semifinalist, would be the sound of silence. ''There will always be some sound in the background, because the life support systems have to run,'' he said. ''If there's real silence on Mars, something is going very badly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet oh, how he wants to go to Mars. ''I was not yet 1 year old when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon,'' he said. ''I was standing on the couch watching it on TV, and my mother wasn't able to pull me away.'' All he ever wanted to do in life was fly and go to space. ''I had my pilot's license before my driver's license,'' he said. At 64, Jan Millsapps, a professor of cinema at San Francisco State University, is among the older candidates on the Mars One list. ''I'm at a point in my life where I'm ready for a new adventure,'' she said. ''I don't feel like I'm running away. It's more like I'm running toward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kellie Gerardi, 26, who works in the commercial spaceflight industry, says that even if Mars One never gets off the ground, it has already succeeded, elevating ''the conversation about the need for space settlements to a global scale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gerardi is planning to get married in September, and a NASA astronaut is to officiate at the ceremony. Yet she would be willing to leave her husband behind should a Mars passport bear her name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why doesn't he apply to the program, too? For one thing, she said, ''he doesn't think it would be fun.'' For another, he's an inch too tall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film is another example of the found-footage genre, in which the movie you're seeing has supposedly been shot, at least partly, by its characters.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one will be aboard this flight test of the new capsule, Orion, but NASA hopes it is the first step toward human exploration of the solar system, including an eventual landing on Mars. Orion's first manned mission is planned for the early 2020s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thursday is the beginning of that journey,'' Mark Geyer, Orion's program manager, said at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orion, which looks like a larger version of the cone-shaped Apollo capsule, is sitting atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Liftoff is scheduled for 7:05 a.m. Thursday, minutes after sunrise. In case of bad weather, the launching can be pushed back by up to two hours and 39 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket's second stage should push the 11-foot-long Orion into an elliptical orbit that reaches 3,600 miles above the Earth's surface on its second orbit. (By contrast, the International Space Station is about 250 miles from Earth.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orion will then re-enter the Earth's atmosphere at 20,000 miles per hour, close to the speeds of a capsule returning from the moon, and temperatures on its heat shield will approach 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the four-and-a-half-hour flight, it will splash down in the Pacific Ocean, about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California, and will be pulled from the water by an amphibious Navy ship, the Anchorage. The capsule will then be trucked back to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for closer examination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight, estimated to cost $375 million, will provide a full-scale test of the performance of Orion's parachutes, heat shield and other systems, with 1,200 sensors recording data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect it to go fine, but you really have to fly it to test it out,'' Mr. Geyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the capsule will not be carrying any people, it will be taking mementos and artifacts. They include a small sample of lunar soil, part of a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil and several artistic works, like poems by Maya Angelou and a recording of the Mars movement from Gustav Holst's ''The Planets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also aboard will be some items from ''Sesame Street'': Cookie Monster's cookie, Ernie's rubber ducky and Grover's cape, part of a collaboration between NASA and the children's television program to promote science and math education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the flight test, NASA's progress for future astronaut missions will be slow, hemmed in by tight federal budgets and competing visions of the agency's future. Orion's next flight, also without people aboard, is not expected until 2018, and the first ride for astronauts would not occur until at least 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel really fortunate to be in the budget plan, a bipartisan agreement on the budget plan, and our job is to execute to that plan,'' Mr. Geyer said. ''Yeah, I wish we could go faster, but I think this is a good plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next destination is also unclear. NASA is pursuing the idea of capturing a small asteroid and taking it to the neighborhood of the moon, and astronauts would then fly in Orion to the asteroid to take a look. NASA officials contend that this ''asteroid redirect'' mission would be within its budget and would develop technologies necessary for the eventual trip to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some skeptics have questioned whether Orion, originally part of a program started under President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon, is even necessary, or a waste of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration canceled Orion and the entire moon program as too expensive and too far behind schedule. But many members of Congress disagreed, and NASA revived a stripped-down version of Orion to be used as a lifeboat for the International Space Station, then resumed a design very close to what had been canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also started work on a heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System that will carry Orion on future launchings. Together, the rocket and the capsule are estimated to cost $19 billion to $22 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some House Republicans have pushed to revive plans to return to the moon, but have not proposed funds to build a lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, NASA is financing the development of two other capsules, built by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, better known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for taking astronauts to and from the space station beginning in 2017, part of what the space agency calls its commercial crew program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Orion won't survive regular commercial crew flight,'' James A. M. Muncy, a space policy consultant who advocates a more entrepreneurial approach to human spaceflight, wrote in an email interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> officials have maintained that their capsule is designed only for taking people to low Earth orbit, but Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, has in the past promoted his Dragon capsule, developed at a much lower cost than Orion, as a possible replacement for Orion for trips to deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the first unmanned Dragon test flight in 2010, Mr. Musk said he hoped NASA would at least consider the possibility. ''Dragon has arguably more capability than Orion,'' he said then. ''Basically, anything Orion can do, Dragon can do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials at NASA and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, the builder of Orion, say it is specifically designed for longer missions, up to 21 days for four astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft also needs to carry several times as much oxygen, food and water as on a trip to low Earth orbit and provide practical amenities for the astronauts. ''It has a bathroom,'' Josh B. Hopkins, the space exploration architect at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orion could take part in an eventual monthslong trip to Mars as part of a larger spacecraft that included more living space for the astronauts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subject of Planck 2014, as the meeting is called, is a new baby picture -- and all of the accompanying vital statistics -- of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and space was as hot as the surface of the sun.

Its microwave portrait reveals a universe 13.8 billion years old that is precisely mysterious, composed of 4.9 percent atomic matter, 26.6 percent mysterious dark matter that is not atomic, and 68.5 percent of even more mysterious dark energy, the glib name for whatever it is that seems to be blowing the universe apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a resounding victory for a sort of standard model of cosmology that has grown up over the last two decades, said Lyman Page, a Princeton astrophysicist, in a phone call from Ferrara. ''What we see is pretty impressive,'' he said. ''It's amazing that just six parameters describe the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmologists still do not know what dark matter -- the material that provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies -- is, but the Planck results have increased their knowledge of what it is not, according to the French Center for National Scientific Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently space experiments like NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer have recorded excess cosmic ray emissions that, some say, could be evidence of a certain kind of dark matter particles colliding and annihilating one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Planck, we need another answer for those experiments, the French agency concluded in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neal Weiner, a particle theorist at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, who is not part of Planck, concurred. That model of dark matter, he said in an email, if not completely excluded, now could be severely constrained. ''If this holds up, at the very least a possibility to discover dark matter is now diminished.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planck dealt a blow to another possible dark matter candidate, namely a brand of the ghostly particles known as neutrinos. Physicists have known of three types of neutrinos for some time and have wondered if there were any more, whose accumulated mass would affect the evolution of the universe. Planck's results leave little room for a fourth kind, so-called sterile neutrinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding the frustration of cosmologists in the room in Ferrara and at large was an issue that has galvanized them for the better part of a year: whether astronomers had detected the very beginnings of the Big Bang in the form of space-time ripples known as gravitational waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The added value of the new Planck data is a map showing how the microwaves are polarized, information that could shed light on what was going on when the universe was a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old, and in the grip of forces about which physicists can only speculate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the hottest topics of speculation these days is the idea -- known as inflation -- that the universe underwent a violent and brief surge of expansion in the earliest moments, settling the geometry and other aspects of the present universe. Such an explosion, theorists say, would have left faint corkscrew swirls, known technically as B-modes, in the pattern of polarization of the microwaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March there was much excitement when a team of American astronomers operating a radio telescope at the South Pole called Bicep2 announced they had detected such a pattern. Alan Guth of M.I.T., one of the inventors of inflation, was at the news conference at Harvard announcing the results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three months of spirited debate, the astronomers conceded, however, that their signal could have been caused by interstellar dust, which can also twist the microwaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Planck, which observed the microwaves in nine different frequencies, making it easy to distinguish dust. Bicep2 had only one frequency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary report from Planck in September confirmed that there was enough dust in Bicep2's patch of sky to account for the twisting, but there are still large uncertainties that leave room for primordial gravitational waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequently, Planck and Bicep agreed to pool their data for a joint analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planck scientists have meanwhile published their own polarization maps, which astronomers say will be useful for studying how the anti-gravitational push of dark energy and the gravitational pull of dark matter orchestrated the growth of galaxies and the universe when it was two or three billion years old -- a sensitive age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bumps in the microwave maps that eventually grow to galaxies amount to a temperature difference of only about 75-millionths of a Kelvin, in an otherwise uniform hiss. To measure polarization, radio astronomers have to discern temperature differences about a tenth of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficulty of doing this research, while the world looks on, can be gauged by the number of missed deadlines. Planck researchers originally hoped to have their polarization studies done this summer. Recently they had set November as their deadline, aiming to present the results at this conference in Ferrara. Likewise, the joint Bicep/Planck paper is now expected this month or in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about this, David Spergel, a Princeton cosmologist and veteran of cosmic microwave studies who had spent the day fielding <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> messages from Ferrara, said he had adopted an acronym often used by NASA in announcing launch dates: NET, meaning ''No Earlier Than.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Loeb, known as Avi, specializes in 400,000 years to one billion years after the Big Bang. He has published more than 400 papers on the nature of early stars, galaxies, planets and black holes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Avi is very good at picking problems to work on that have testable results,'' said Robert Wilson, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics (with Arno Penzias) for discovering cosmic microwave background radiation, thought to be a remnant of the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke with Dr. Loeb, 52, in his office here at <span class="companylink">Harvard</span>, where he is the chairman of the astronomy department, and then later by telephone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is an edited and condensed version of our conversations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE EARLY UNIVERSE AS YOUR AREA OF STUDY?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Because I like to work where there's no crowd. One of the great pleasures of astrophysics is trying figure out something about the universe that nobody else has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I first came to <span class="companylink">Harvard</span>, about 20 years ago, I was attracted to the question of how and when did the first stars and galaxies form, because this was something that we really didn't know much about. The only thing we knew was related to the cosmic microwave background radiation which originated about 400,000 years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also knew that the galaxies and the stars didn't always exist. So the question was, when did they form?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, I've helped develop tools to image and map what happened. I've done calculations and suggested to observational astronomers ways to approach this era. I've developed a technique to image the universe in three dimensions that relates to the times when galaxies were formed, and I helped develop tests so that we can detect previously unknown galaxies and black holes. I also developed a test which will hopefully permit us to see the expansion of the universe in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be loaded onto the James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to be launched in 2018. This should produce new insights. So this once lonely field has gotten crowded. It may be time to do other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST YEAR YOU PUBLISHED AN ASTONISHING PAPER SUGGESTING THAT SOME TYPE OF LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE, BILLIONS OF YEARS BEFORE IT APPEARED ON EARTH. WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thanksgiving morning, I had this realization: that at the time the first stars and galaxies were formed, the cosmic microwave background -- the radiation left over from the earliest time -- was roughly at room temperature. So the universe, at roughly 15 million years after the Big Bang, was at a comfortable enough temperature for the chemistry of life to have incubated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realized this while in the shower -- as often happens. We had guests coming in the afternoon. So I asked my wife if instead of helping her with the meal, I could take care of the dishes after dinner. That gave me a few free hours to think this out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it came down to was that if there had been planets that early, they could have been warmed by the cosmic microwave background. They didn't need to be warmed by a star. And so the chemistry of life could have started that early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After I finished working this out, I posted a draft of my paper on arXiv.org, a server where astrophysicists upload writings for feedback from colleagues. To my surprise, journalists also looked at it. Immediately, the phone rang. The paper ended up receiving a lot of media attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are interested. Historically, cosmology has described the universe as full of lifeless objects. That may be a misconception. It may be that the universe is teeming with life. The problem is that life does not produce a lot of energy and it's hard to detect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been curious about how this limits us in the search for life. Suppose there is an extraterrestrial civilization on a planet near a star not far from us, and suppose there was a nuclear war there. Could we see it with our telescopes? Turns out that even with the most powerful of contemporary telescopes, we couldn't see the flare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there are ideas and techniques for detecting more subtle signatures -- for example, radio signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YOU ONCE PUBLISHED A PAPER SUGGESTING THAT IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE, WE MIGHT SEEK OUT MARKERS OF INDUSTRIALIZATION, LIKE SMOG. SMOG?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, smog might serve as a fingerprint of an industrial civilization. It's always been thought that the way to detect life elsewhere was to look for signs of oxygen. But intelligent life could produce unnatural molecules. They might do that intentionally if their planet was too cold for life. Unnatural molecules might even show signs of a civilization that may not exist anymore because unnatural molecules can survive long after a civilization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME OF YOUR WORK SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE SCIENCE FICTION. WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that. Nature has richness beyond our imagination. What I look for are interesting astrophysics questions that are provable. Though my research may ask unconventional questions, the answers are based on calculations, experiments and observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE AN ASTROPHYSICIST?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a young age, I was attracted to philosophy because it asked the most interesting questions. But then, at 18, I had to do my military service in Israel, where I grew up. After some testing, I was allowed to join a special program where you could work on projects useful for the defense of the country. I ended up doing research in plasma physics. And because of that, I was able to visit the United States in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During one of these trips, I visited the Institute for Advanced Study. A month later, I was offered the opportunity to do a postdoc there. There was one condition, though: I had to switch to astrophysics. That appealed because it was like returning to an old love -- philosophy. In astrophysics, I could address very big questions about nature and life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN YOUR STUDIES OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE, YOU RUN SMACK AGAINST THE IDEAS OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first chapter of the Bible states that there was a beginning in time. Science shows that we live in an expanding universe, and if you extrapolate, there was a point in time in when things began. In some ways, they are consistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IS IT POSSIBLE FOR AN ASTROPHYSICIST TO BE RELIGIOUS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It really depends on what you mean by ''God.'' Spinoza would feel very comfortable with modern science because in his philosophy, God is nature. That pretty much summarizes Einstein's view, too. So if you're defining God in a way that identifies the laws of nature with his or her qualities, that's perfectly consistent. But if you attribute parts of reality to God in a way that cannot be understood by rational thinking, a conflict emerges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE VAST QUANTITIES OF TIME AND SPACE THAT YOU MUST NAVIGATE TO DO YOUR WORK? DO YOU, AS IN THAT OLD KURT WEILL SONG, EVER FEEL LOST IN THE STARS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I do not feel lost in the stars, but rather at home with all of them. When I look at the stars of the Milky Way on a clear night, they appear to me like the lights of a giant spaceship streaming through the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are there any passengers around the other lights in this spaceship? It would be fun to know and perhaps, share experiences with them.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the point of space, after all, if it cannot be filled with grandiose dreams?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least that is what city, county and Texas officials were betting on when they offered millions of dollars in incentives to lure <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to Brownsville, Tex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space exploration company, founded by the billionaire investor Elon Musk, announced earlier this year that it would open a private orbital launch facility on Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville. The very first human who steps foot on Mars, Mr. Musk told a crowd on groundbreaking day, could be launched from the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk and his Gulf Coast launchpad may be the state's answer to Richard Branson and New Mexico's Spaceport America, where Virgin Galactic is working to open space travel for tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk has upped the space-race ante, offering humankind a way to hedge its bet against extinction on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that's going to fundamentally affect humanity's future is, are we a multiplanet species or are we a single-planet species?'' Mr. Musk said at the groundbreaking. ''A single-planet species is much more vulnerable than a multiplanet species, because if some calamity were to happen to one planet, it could destroy civilization, maybe bring an end to humanity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> was coming to Brownsville was met with fanfare. Not only would <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> put the city on the global map for space exploration, said officials who committed millions of dollars in financing and incentives to woo the company, but it would also be a huge economic boon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the kind of promise a city like Brownsville, where 34 percent of the population lives below the poverty level, sees as a game-changer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to take us to a whole different level in the state of Texas,'' said Gilberto Salinas, the executive vice president of the Brownsville Economic Development Council. ''<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will be one of several companies that's going to make Texas the leader in the space industry, except now it's going to be in the commercial side. We're excited to be a part of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is among a growing group of companies competing in a new kind of space race -- an effort to monetize manned spaceflights. Several of the competitors have operations in Texas. While private companies are running the race, public dollars are often fueling it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> plans to use Midland's airport to launch suborbital spaceflights; Blue Origin, a company backed by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has a launchpad in West Texas; and Firefly, a small satellite launch company recently announced the opening of an office in Cedar Park. Blue Origin is exploring cheaper options for human spaceflight, but few details of its work have been made public. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Graf, the director of the Texas Office of Aerospace, Aviation and Defense, says the state's wide-open skies and areas of low population are attracting companies that see profits in private spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the first private rockets ever launched was actually launched from Texas, Matagorda Bay, almost 30 years ago in 1982 -- it's continuing on that legacy,'' Mr. Graf said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk's vision for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is to make spaceflight more accessible, and ultimately to colonize Mars. It is a vision that many public officials in Texas have embraced, and that Mr. Musk considers essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Musk is not in Brownsville because he wanted to go to Texas. He is there because state officials have been more than willing to roll out the red carpet for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and other space companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last legislative session in 2013, state lawmakers passed bills changing the Open Beaches Act to make launches from state beaches possible. And more than $40 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund has gone to aerospace corporate expansion, according to an August report from the governor's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, of course, no guarantees that all will end well. Critics point to New Mexico, where the government invested more than $200 million in Spaceport America. Though it was pitched as a hub for space tourism for the rich and famous, Virgin Galactic has yet to launch a manned flight into space from the facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent fatal crash of a test vehicle in California has further slowed Virgin Galactic's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, a conservative research group in New Mexico, says no one knows when the private space industry will become viable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someday it'll probably be viable, but what's that someday?'' Mr. Gessing said. ''Fifty, 100 years? You've got to talk about the time value of money, and whether taxpayers should be really footing the bill for this kind of thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gessing said he did not think it wise for public money to be invested in the spaceward dreams of billionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just don't see the market for this kind of facility out there, in terms of demand. In New Mexico's case, it was an extremely misguided decision,'' he said, adding that even more public money would be spent in the future on maintenance. ''That's kind of the rub for us, not just that they put all their eggs in one basket, but that they spent so much money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graf acknowledged that spaceflights were risky, but said the investments Texas had made were smart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The industry itself is risky, but so is getting on an airplane or driving to work every day,'' he said. ''There are inherent risks. But we're placing our money wisely, and it is going into infrastructure to help grow the industry. And in Texas, primarily, it's the private industry that's making the capital investments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the risks, both safety and financial, Mr. Salinas brushed them off, saying the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> facility in Brownsville was different than the New Mexico site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's why they call it rocket science -- it's not easy to get spacecraft into outer space,'' Mr. Salinas said. ''Do we have full faith in the project? Yes, because it's Elon Musk. When you are able to say this is a person that reminds us of what Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and, to a certain extent, what Henry Ford and Thomas Edison have done, then it's very easy to believe and see his vision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Baffes, who calls himself a ''NewSpace consultant'' and is a member of the Greater Austin Space Economy Working Group, said turning over the reins of space exploration and development to private industry would encourage innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you open this up to thousands of people, that's when you really will see innovation happen in space,'' Mr. Baffes said. ''We're opening this up to as many innovators as we can find out there, and that's when we're really going to see the space program cash in on the promise we've all wanted it to do, for so many years.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took more than a decade, and a looping trajectory that covered four billion miles, before a spacecraft launched by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> caught up with a mysterious comet near Jupiter in August -- and three more months before it gently lowered an automated probe to study what makes these primordial remnants from the early solar system tick. Last-minute malfunctions hampered the ability of the probe to complete its inspection of surface and subsurface conditions. Even so, the mission appears to be a history-making achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft is named Rosetta, and like the stone that helped researchers decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics, scientists hope this mission will help decipher clues to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comet -- known inelegantly as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- is a small, irregular glob of ice, dust and rocks less than three miles across, with a boulder-strewn surface that has only a small number of spots suitable for landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosetta has already scored two significant firsts. It is the first spacecraft to fly alongside and orbit a comet, not just fly by it, and it will stay close for more than a year to observe the comet as it goes from a quiescent state to an active emitter of gases as it draws closer to the sun. It will be the most sustained research ever conducted on one of these elusive bodies. Rosetta is also the first spacecraft to send an automated probe to the surface of a comet, allowing close study of its composition. Previous probes have landed on various planets, moons and asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight presented formidable technical challenges. The spacecraft could not carry enough fuel for a direct journey, so it looped around Earth and Mars to gain speed before heading toward the comet's orbital path. During its serpentine journey, Rosetta was forced to hibernate for two and a half years to conserve power. To the relief of space experts, it awoke on schedule in January, ending fears that it might never come back to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things did not go as well when the automated landing probe was lowered to the surface. The probe can't be steered; it simply floats gently down, drawn by the minuscule gravity of the small comet. The probe was supposed to be held to the surface by reverse thrusters pressing it down and two harpoons fastening it to the surface. Neither system worked, so the probe bounced lazily twice before landing in a tilted position against a cliff with its solar panels largely shaded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the setback, the probe's mosaic of 10 instruments was able to collect and transmit data for 57 hours before its batteries died and it went into hibernation. Scientists on the project claim they have already made important discoveries that overshadow what they consider minor glitches, though that remains to be seen. They have learned, for example, that the comet is not as soft as they expected but has a hard surface below a layer of dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several experiments misfired. For instance, the shutters on an instrument meant to shoot X-rays at materials to analyze their composition failed to open, and a rod meant to measure heat flow broke when hammered into the hard surface. Meanwhile, an instrument on the spacecraft came up with readings at odds with scientific speculation that comets like this one may have bombarded Earth with enough water over the ages to fill much of the oceans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll learn more when researchers present their findings at a professional conference next month. The probe may revive as the comet gets closer to the sun, and its mother ship, Rosetta, remains operational. It will continue to monitor the comet on its journey around the sun and back out again, producing the most extensive information ever collected about these vagabonds of the solar system.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Earth is a dying dust bowl where a blight is destroying all the crops and oxygen. Schoolchildren are being taught that the moon landings were faked to bankrupt the Russians, and NASA is a secret agency consisting of a dozen scientists huddling underground. The <span class="companylink">Yankees</span> are a barnstorming troupe who play games in cornfields and let ground balls go through their legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the world of ''Interstellar,'' the space thriller directed by Christopher Nolan, of ''Inception'' and ''The Dark Knight'' fame, and written by him and his brother Jonathan, that hit theaters in a tsunami of publicity this month.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been looking forward to ''Interstellar'' ever since I first heard back in 2006 that physicists led by the celebrated gravitational theorist and Caltech professor Kip Thorne had held a workshop to brainstorm a science-fiction movie. This would be the movie that finally got things right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as an astronaut named Cooper, who leads an expedition to another galaxy in search of a new home for humanity, and, stars among others, Mackenzie Foy, who grows up into Jessica Chastain, as his daughter, Murph (named after the law), who is mad that he left. On one level, it is a heroically realistic tale of space exploration. On another level, it's a story about father-daughter relationships, as well as a meditation on the human spirit and what happens when humans take their eyes off the stars. But it's also about quantum gravity and the mysteries of the fifth dimension, and even an astronaut who was at a screening with me confessed that he was confused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time I saw it, I too was confused, and disappointed. Aside from a wonderful view of Cooper's spacecraft dwarfed by lonely blackness down at the corner of the <span class="companylink">Imax</span> screen as it passed by a magnificently glowing Saturn, and tense docking sequences similar to certain scenes in ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' it was short on the magic and the delicious storytelling twists I expect from the Nolan brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second time I saw the movie, clued in by Dr. Thorne's new book, ''The Science of Interstellar,'' I enjoyed it more, and I could appreciate that a lot of hard-core 20th- and 21st-century physics, especially string theory, was buried in the story -- and that there was a decipherable, if abstruse, logic to the ending. But I wonder if a movie that requires a 324-page book to explicate it can be considered a totally successful work of art. The movie's pedigree goes back to Carl Sagan, a Cornell astronomer and author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1980, he arranged a blind date between Dr. Thorne and Lynda Obst, a good friend and self-admitted ''science geek'' who later produced ''Contact'' and ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' among other films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They dated briefly and then became good friends. In 2006, they wrote an eight-page treatment for a film about a crew of astronauts, including Stephen Hawking and a romantically attached assistant, who travel through the universe and slightly backward in time by way of wormholes. Out there, they encounter a race of advanced five-dimensional beings who live outside of our own space-time and communicate with it and us only by gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Caltech workshop, Jonathan Nolan rewrote the story, and Christopher Nolan rewrote it again after he took over from Steven Spielberg as the director. As a result, Dr. Thorne said, the final screenplay bears little resemblance to the original story he and Ms. Obst wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the movie, a wormhole, presumably built by some advanced alien race about which we know nothing, has opened up in space out near Saturn. It goes to another galaxy where scouting expeditions have identified three promising planets orbiting a giant supermassive black hole. It is Cooper's job to check out those planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As executive producer, Dr. Thorne had the job of keeping the moviemakers from violating any known laws of physics, his criterion for acceptance being ''something serious physicists would at least discuss over beer,'' as he put it in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His book, he stressed, represents his interpretation, and not necessarily the director's, of what happens or could have happened in the movie, a sort of scientific back story. ''A large fraction is stuff I discussed with Chris,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Thorne said he had almost always been able to find a way to accommodate Mr. Nolan's ideas. Luckily, as he said, ''There is a lot of leeway beyond the frontier.'' At one point, director Nolan asked for a planet on which the dilation of time because of immensely powerful gravity was so severe that one hour there would correspond to seven years on Earth -- an Einsteinian effect that plays a big role in the plot. Dr. Thorne's first reaction was ''no way.'' But after thinking about it, he says he found a way, which would require the planet to be very close to a massive black hole spinning at nearly its maximum rate. The hole would spin space around with it, like a mixer swirling thick dough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet could get its heat and light from the disk of heated material swirling around the hole, Dr. Thorne calculated, as long as the hole was not feeding too strongly -- a rather carefully tuned but not impossible situation. The black hole itself sprang directly from Dr. Thorne's equations, and its renderings by the movie's visual effects supervisor, Paul Franklin, showed details that Dr. Thorne plans to write papers about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wormholes are another thing that easily pass the beer test. Einstein himself pointed out that such shortcuts through space-time were at least allowed by his equations, but nobody knows how to make one or to keep it from collapsing, or how to install one near Saturn without its gravitational field's disrupting the entire solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ditto the fifth dimension, a logical consequence of various brands of string theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not everyone drinks the same beer. So some scientists and science writers -- not all of whom have had the advantage of reading Dr. Thorne's elaborate explanations -- have paid the movie the ultimate compliment: taking it seriously enough to subject it to a kind of public peer review. The blogs and other forms of science media have bloomed with criticisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some might say, 'Why quibble? It's just a movie''' said David H. Grinspoon of the <span class="companylink">Planetary Science Institute</span> in Tucson, Ariz., and a participant in the 2006 workshop, who complained of sloppy planetary science in the movie. Even with a voracious blight, he said, it would take millions of years to draw down Earth's oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So why did they take care with relativity but not even bother with planetary science?'' he went on. ''Arthur C. Clarke is spinning in his stargate!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a moviegoer, I have a high tolerance for artistic license and wild ideas. As long as it was in space in this universe, the movie worked for me. It was on either end, on Earth and in the fifth dimension, that ''Interstellar'' goes off the rails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard for me to imagine, for example, a discredited and underground NASA able to launch rockets to another galaxy, scouting expeditions through the wormhole, spending trillions of dollars without anyone knowing. This crew should give secret-keeping lessons to the N.S.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does it seem plausible to me that there seems to be about one theoretical physicist left in the world, who happens to be Professor Brand (Michael Caine), Cooper's old teacher and NASA's leader. All the hundreds of string theorists now filling college chairs have gone away despite the discovery of that wormhole and the fifth dimension, confirming the wildest ideas of string theory, which would be worth a handful of Nobel Prizes -- unless they too, have gone underground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the fifth dimension, too much of the critical action happens there, where none of us have ever been, at the behest of those mysterious ''bulk beings'' who built the wormhole, presumably to save mankind. Who are they? Cooper speculates that they are humans who have evolved, but it doesn't matter. We never see them. For the purposes of the movie, they could be Norse gods, angels, Superman or whoever made the monoliths in ''2001,'' a wild card the Nolans can play at will, a deus ex machina, in other words. That's cheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they're so powerful, why don't they stop the blight? Or fix up a planet in our own solar system? Nor are the planets in that other galaxy all that impressive. One of them has tsunamis a mile high, the other has clouds of solid ice (Dr. Thorne has admitted wincing when he sees that). And who really wants to live next to a hungry black hole? Compared with this, Mars looks pretty good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After traveling the universe of ''Interstellar,'' I'd rather stay home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 20, 2014, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Out There column on Tuesday, about the movie ''Interstellar,'' misidentified the city and state in which the <span class="companylink">Planetary Science Institute</span> is located.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Philae is talking to us,'' announced the manager in charge of the little piece of machinery that had just achieved the first landing on a comet, a frozen remnant from the formation of the solar system. ''We are on the comet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note the familiar, almost casual tone. It was as if the first thing the probe did on arrival was to call home, like a traveler with an ever-ready iPhone. The flight had taken forever, and that was some landing -- bouncing around and finally winding up almost halfway across the surface. The <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s probe was ''talking'' about its comet landing on Wednesday after a 10-year, four-billion-mile journey.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''we'' echoes a famous human-machine flight relationship, Lindbergh's solo crossing of the Atlantic in ''The Spirit of St. Louis.'' Here, the distant robotic messenger and the human receiver -- the ''we'' -- are also collaborators in reaching a new milestone in flight. Philae had made it to the surface on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, an icy, rocky place only two and a half miles wide and 317 million miles from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as even the most stalwart human explorers remain confined to lower Earth orbit for the foreseeable future, the search for discovery in the outer reaches of the solar system is left to robotic probes. They are conceived by humans to go where humans themselves cannot go. But that does not preclude the development of a strong human-machine bond over years of building, testing and flying a mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minders of these machines may spend half a career on an idea they will then cast into the heavens, and wait through what may seem like another half-career for it to reach its destination and send back results. The human-machine bond can be tight. Even no-nonsense scientists and engineers find themselves personalizing such a consuming life experience as well as a trusted machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, they too are guilty of the transgression they warn laypeople against: anthropomorphism, the attribution of human form and behavior to nonhuman or even inanimate forms. A machine is talking to us. It was shaken up by the three-bounce landing, at last coming to rest near a sheltering rock face (not a choice place, as it prevents sunlight from reaching the lander's solar panels, which were counted on to charge its batteries). Poor Philae may not have long to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could be more natural than treating the probe in almost human terms when you have spent at least a decade, waking and dreaming, with machinery on which such care is bestowed that it penetrates to your very core? Your dog may or may not be your best friend, and who knows about the cat? But Philae talks to you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding something to relate to is a never-ending struggle for humans, as spacecraft and telescopes draw attention to unworldly realms. Thomas A. Mutch of <span class="companylink">Brown University</span> was the principal geologist for the Viking missions in 1976 to search for possible life on Mars. When the first Viking landed on Mars and started transmitting pictures of the immediate surface, Dr. Mutch (known to all as Tim) focused his excitement on a single rock near of the craft's footpads. The rock was red, as was nearly everything around on the russet plain, and so the geologist had something he could relate to. He would deal with the big picture in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporters don't always resist the temptation to make homey comparisons of faraway encounters. In 1983, the <span class="companylink">Pioneer</span> 10 spacecraft crossed the orbit of Pluto. Though it has since been stripped of full planetary standing, Pluto still represents a frontier into a greater unknown. <span class="companylink">Pioneer</span> had flown by and photographed Jupiter and Saturn and was still going. Writing about this, I kept hearing the rhythm of the Little Engine That Could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I sought to put the same bug in the reader's ear: Like the little engine that could, this was the little spacecraft that would probably push on to the frontier of interstellar space and still be living to tell the tale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, a French author, might have been able to understand our problem with perspective, in a universe so vast in which we are so small. Aside from his books on early aviation, he wrote about the Little Prince, who lived on a small asteroid where he cared for a single rose. The book was written for children, but with grown-ups very much in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fox the little prince meets has some of the wisest lines. ''One sees clearly only with the heart,'' he says. ''What is essential is invisible to the eye.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you pull off Highway 101 and head into Sunnyvale, Calif., the first thing you notice is how boring innovation looks up close. This small Silicon Valley city, which abuts both Cupertino, the home of Apple, and Mountain View, the site of the Googleplex, is where <span class="companylink">Lockheed</span> built the Poseidon nuclear missile. It's where the forebear of NASA did some of its most important research and where a prototype for Pong debuted at a neighborhood bar. Countless ambitious start-ups -- with names like Qvivr, Schoolfy, eCloset.me and PeerPal -- appear in Sunnyvale every year. Aesthetically, though, the city is one enormous glass-and-stucco office park after another. Its dominant architectural feature, the five-story headquarters of <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, a few minutes from Innovation Way, looks about as futuristic as a suburban hospital.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an industry becomes more dynamic, its architecture, by necessity, often becomes less inspiring. These squat buildings have thick outer walls that allow for a minimal number of internal support beams, creating versatile open-floor plans for any kind of company -- one processing silicon into solar-power arrays, say, or a start-up monitoring weed elimination in industrial agriculture. In Sunnyvale, companies generally don't stay the same size. They expand quickly or go out of business, and then the office has to be ready for the next tenant. These buildings need to be the business equivalent of dorms: spaces designed to house important and tumultuous periods of people's lives before being cleaned out and prepped for the next occupant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best place to behold the Valley's success as a platform for innovation is a 27,000-square-foot facility just down the block from <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>. This is the warehouse of Weird Stuff, a 21-person company that buys the office detritus that start-ups no longer want. One section of the space teems with hundreds of laptops and desktops; another is overloaded with C.P.U.s and orphaned cubicle partitions. ''If founders are in a building that's costing $50,000 a month, and they've lost their funding and have to be out by next Friday, we respond very quickly,'' said Chuck Schuetz, the founder of Weird Stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weird Stuff also acquires goods from the start-ups that succeed, when they are ready to upgrade offices and need to offload their old equipment. ''We get truckloads every day,'' Schuetz told me. He said that he receives a lot of calls from government offices and large corporate-network operators who desperately need, for example, a 1981 <span class="companylink">Seagate</span> ST506 hard drive in order to keep a crucial piece of equipment running. But much of his stuff is bought by new waves of start-ups in search of inexpensive keyboards or cubicle partitions. What doesn't move is sold to scrap dealers. ''This,'' he said, gesturing to the giant scrap bin out back, ''is where everything ends up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, entrepreneurs and digital gurus of various repute have referred to this era, in a breathlessness bordering on proselytizing, as the age of innovation. But Weird Stuff is a reminder of another, unexpected truth about innovation: It is, by necessity, inextricably linked with failure. The path to any success is lined with disasters. Most of the products that do make it out of the lab fail spectacularly once they hit the market. Even successful products will ultimately fail when a better idea comes along. (One of Schuetz's most remarkable finds is a portable eight-track player.) And those lucky innovations that are truly triumphant, the ones that transform markets and industries, create widespread failure among their competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An age of constant invention naturally begets one of constant failure. The life span of an innovation, in fact, has never been shorter. An African hand ax from 285,000 years ago, for instance, was essentially identical to those made some 250,000 years later. The Sumerians believed that the hoe was invented by a godlike figure named Enlil a few thousand years before Jesus, but a similar tool was being used a thousand years after his death. During the Middle Ages, amid major advances in agriculture, warfare and building technology, the failure loop closed to less than a century. During the Enlightenment and early Industrial Revolution, it was reduced to about a lifetime. By the 20th century, it could be measured in decades. Today, it is best measured in years and, for some products, even less. (Schuetz receives tons of smartphones that are only a season or two old.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closure of the failure loop has sent uncomfortable ripples through the economy. When a product or company is no longer valued in the marketplace, there are typically thousands of workers whose own market value diminishes, too. Our breakneck pace of innovation can be seen in stock-market volatility and other boardroom metrics, but it can also be measured in unemployment checks, in divorces and involuntary moves and in promising careers turned stagnant. Every derelict product that makes its way into Weird Stuff exists as part of a massive ecosystem of human lives -- of engineers and manufacturers; sales people and marketing departments; logistics planners and truck drivers -- that has shared in this process of failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation is, after all, terrifying. Right now we're going through changes that rip away the core logic of our economy. Will there be enough jobs to go around? Will they pay a living wage? Terror, however, can also be helpful. The only way to harness this new age of failure is to learn how to bounce back from disaster and create the societal institutions that help us do so. The real question is whether we're up for the challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a tour of Weird Stuff, Schuetz mentioned a purple chair that he kept among the office furniture piled haphazardly in the back of his facility. Unbeknown to him, that chair actually provides a great way to understand the acceleration of innovation and failure that began 150 years ago. In ancient times, purple chairs were virtually priceless. Back then, all cloth dyes were made from natural products, like flower petals or crushed rocks; they either bled or faded and needed constant repair. One particular purple dye, which was culled from the glandular mucus of shellfish, was among the rarest and most prized colors. It was generally reserved for royalty. Nobody had surplus purple chairs piled up for $20 a pop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that all changed in 1856, with a discovery by an 18-year-old English chemist named William Henry Perkin. Tinkering in his home laboratory, Perkin was trying to synthesize an artificial form of quinine, an antimalarial agent. Although he botched his experiments, he happened to notice that one substance maintained a bright and unexpected purple color that didn't run or fade. Perkin, it turned out, had discovered a way of making arguably the world's most coveted color from incredibly cheap coal tar. He patented his invention -- the first synthetic dye -- created a company and sold shares to raise capital for a factory. Eventually his dye, and generations of dye that followed, so thoroughly democratized the color purple that it became the emblematic color of cheesy English rock bands, Prince albums and office chairs for those willing to dare a hue slightly more bold than black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perkin's fortuitous failure, it's safe to say, would have never occurred even a hundred years earlier. In pre-modern times, when starvation was common and there was little social insurance outside your clan, every individual bore the risk of any new idea. As a result, risks simply weren't worth taking. If a clever idea for a crop rotation failed or an enhanced plow was ineffective, a farmer's family might not get enough to eat. Children might die. Even if the innovation worked, any peasant who found himself with an abundance of crops would most likely soon find a representative of the local lord coming along to claim it. A similar process, one in which success was stolen and failure could be lethal, also ensured that carpenters, cobblers, bakers and the other skilled artisans would only innovate slowly, if at all. So most people adjusted accordingly by living near arable land, having as many children as possible (a good insurance policy) and playing it safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our relationship with innovation finally began to change, however, during the Industrial Revolution. While individual inventors like James Watt and Eli Whitney tend to receive most of the credit, perhaps the most significant changes were not technological but rather legal and financial. The rise of stocks and bonds, patents and agricultural futures allowed a large number of people to broadly share the risks of possible failure and the rewards of potential success. If it weren't for these tools, a tinkerer like Perkin would never have been messing around with an attempt at artificial quinine in the first place. And he wouldn't have had any way to capitalize on his idea. Anyway, he probably would have been too consumed by tilling land and raising children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perkin's invention may have brought cheap purple (and, later, green and red) dyes to the masses, but it helped upend whatever was left of the existing global supply chain, with its small cottage-size dye houses and its artisanal crafts people who were working with lichen and bugs. For millenniums, the economy had been built around subsistence farming, small-batch artisanal work and highly localized markets. Inventions like Perkin's -- and the steam engine, the spinning jenny, the telegraph, the Bessemer steel-production process -- destroyed the last vestiges of this way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original age of innovation may have ushered in an era of unforeseen productivity, but it was, for millions of people, absolutely terrifying. Over a generation or two, however, our society responded by developing a new set of institutions to lessen the pain of this new volatility, including unions, Social Security and the single greatest risk-mitigating institution ever: the corporation. During the late 19th century, a series of experiments in organizational structure culminated, in the 1920s, with the birth of <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>, the first modern corporation. Its basic characteristics soon became ubiquitous. Ownership, which was once a job passed from father to son, was now divided among countless shareholders. Management, too, was divided, among a large group of professionals who directed units, or ''subdivisions,'' within it. The corporation, in essence, acted as a giant risk-sharing machine, amassing millions of investors' capital and spreading it among a large number of projects, then sharing the returns broadly too. The corporation managed the risk so well, in fact, that it created an innovation known as the steady job. For the first time in history, the risks of innovation were not borne by the poorest. This resulted in what economists call the Great Compression, when the gap between the income of the rich and poor rapidly fell to its lowest margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secret of the corporation's success, however, was that it generally did not focus on truly transformative innovations. Most firms found that the surest way to grow was to perfect the manufacturing of the same products, year after year. G.M., <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span>, <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>, Kellogg's, <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> and other iconic companies achieved their breakthrough insights in the pre-corporate era and spent the next several decades refining them, perhaps introducing a new product every decade or so. During the period between 1870 and 1920, cars, planes, electricity, telephones and radios were introduced. But over the next 50 years, as cars and planes got bigger and electricity and phones became more ubiquitous, the core technologies stayed fundamentally the same. (Though some notable exceptions include the television, nuclear power and disposable diapers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrated corporate-research departments at <span class="companylink">Bell Labs</span>, <span class="companylink">DuPont</span> and <span class="companylink">Xerox</span> may have employed scores of white-coated scientists, but their impact was blunted by the thick shell of bureaucracy around them. <span class="companylink">Bell Labs</span> conceived some radical inventions, like the transistor, the laser and many of the programming languages in use today, but its parent company, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>, ignored many of them to focus on its basic telephone monopoly. <span class="companylink">Xerox</span> scientists came up with the mouse, the visual operating system, laser printers and Ethernet, but they couldn't interest their bosses back East, who were focused on protecting the copier business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate leaders weren't stupid. They were simply making so much money that they didn't see any reason to risk it all on lots of new ideas. This conservatism extended through the ranks. Economic stability allowed millions more people to forgo many of the risk-mitigation strategies that had been in place for millenniums. Family size plummeted. Many people moved away from arable land (Arizona!). Many young people, most notably young women, saw new forms of economic freedom when they were no longer tied to the routine of frequent childbirth. Failure was no longer the expectation; most people could predict, with reasonable assurance, what their lives and careers would look like decades into the future. Our institutions -- unions, schools, corporate career tracks, pensions and retirement accounts -- were all predicated on a stable and rosy future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now know, of course, that this golden moment was really a benevolent blip. In reality, the failure loop was closing far faster than we ever could have realized. The American corporate era quietly began to unravel in the 1960s. David Hounshell, a scholar of the history of American innovation, told me about a key moment in 1968, when <span class="companylink">DuPont</span> introduced Qiana, a kind of nylon with a silklike feel, whose name was selected through a computer-generated list of meaningless five-letter words. <span class="companylink">DuPont</span> had helped to create the modern method of product development, in which managers would identify a market need and simply inform the research department that it had to produce a solution by a specific date. Over the course of decades, this process was responsible for successful materials like Freon, Lucite, Orlon, Dacron and Mylar. In Qiana, <span class="companylink">DuPont</span> hoped that it had the next Lycra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not long after the company introduced Qiana to the market, it was met by a flood of cheap Japanese products made from polyester. Qiana, which only came close to breaking even during one year of sales, eventually sustained operating losses of more than $200 million. Similar shudders were felt in corporate suites across America, as new global competitors -- first from Europe, then from Asia -- shook up the stable order of the automotive and steel industries. Global trade narrowed the failure loop from generations to a decade or less, far shorter than most people's careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For American workers, the greatest challenge would come from computers. By the 1970s, the impact of computers was greatest in lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs. Factory workers competed with computer-run machines; secretaries and bookkeepers saw their jobs eliminated by desktop software. Over the last two decades, the destabilizing forces of computers and the Internet has spread to even the highest-paid professions. Corporations ''were created to coordinate and organize communication among lots of different people,'' says Chris Dixon, a partner at the venture-capital firm <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span>. ''A lot of those organizations are being replaced by computer networks.'' Dixon says that start-ups like Uber and Kickstarter are harbingers of a much larger shift, in which loose groupings of individuals will perform functions that were once the domain of larger corporations. ''If you had to know one thing that will explain the next 20 years, that's the key idea: We are moving toward a period of decentralization,'' Dixon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were we simply enduring a one-time shift into an age of computers, the adjustment might just require us to retrain and move onward. Instead, in a time of constant change, it's hard for us to predict the skills that we will need in the future. Whereas the corporate era created a virtuous cycle of growing companies, better-paid workers and richer consumers, we're now suffering through a cycle of destabilization, whereby each new technology makes it ever easier and faster to create the next one, which, of course, leads to more and more failure. It's enough to make us feel like mollusk-gland hunters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much as William Henry Perkin's generation ripped apart an old way of life, the innovation era is sundering the stability of the corporate age. Industries that once seemed resistant to change are only now entering the early stages of major disruption. A large percentage of the health-care industry, for example, includes the rote work of recording, storing and accessing medical records. But many companies are currently devising ways to digitize our medical documents more efficiently. Many economists believe that peer-to-peer lending, Bitcoin and other financial innovations will soon strike at the core of banking by making it easier to receive loans or seed money outside a traditional institution. Education is facing the threat of computer-based learning posed by Khan Academy, Coursera and other upstart companies. Government is changing, too. India recently introduced a site that allows anybody to see which government workers are showing up for their jobs on time (or at all) and which are shirking. Similarly, Houston recently developed a complex database that helps managers put an end to runaway overtime costs. These changes are still new, in part because so many large businesses benefit from the old system and use their capital to impede innovation. But the changes will inevitably become greater, and the results will be drastic. Those four industries -- health care, finance, education and government -- represent well more than half of the U.S. economy. The lives of tens of millions of people will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some professions, however, are already demonstrating ways to embrace failure. For example, there's an uncharacteristic explosion of creativity among accountants. Yes, accountants: Groups like the Thriveal C.P.A. Network and the VeraSage Institute are leading that profession from its roots in near-total risk aversion to something approaching the opposite. Computing may have commoditized much of the industry's everyday work, but some enterprising accountants are learning how to use some of their biggest assets -- the trust of their clients and access to financial data -- to provide deep insights into a company's business. They're identifying which activities are most profitable, which ones are wasteful and when the former become the latter. Accounting once was entirely backward-looking and, because no one would pay for an audit for fun, dependent on government regulation. It was a cost. Now real-time networked software can make it forward-looking and a source of profit. It's worth remembering, though, that this process never ends: As soon as accountants discover a new sort of service to provide their customers, some software innovator will be seeking ways to automate it, which means those accountants will work to constantly come up with even newer ideas. The failure loop will continue to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers, too, are trying to transform computers from a threat into a value-adding tool. For centuries the legal profession has made a great deal of money from drawing up contracts or patent applications that inevitably sit in drawers, unexamined. Software can insert boilerplate language more cheaply now. But some computer-minded lawyers have found real value in those cabinets filled with old contracts and patent filings. They use data-sniffing programs and their own legal expertise to cull through millions of patent applications or contracts to build never-before-seen complex models of the business landscape and sell it to their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing industry is going through the early stages of its own change. Until quite recently, it cost tens of millions of dollars to build a manufacturing plant. Today, 3-D printing and cloud manufacturing, a process in which entrepreneurs pay relatively little to access other companies' machines during downtime, have drastically lowered the barrier to entry for new companies. Many imagine this will revitalize the business of making things in America. Successful factories, like accounting firms, need to focus on special new products that no one in Asia has yet figured out how to mass produce. Something similar is happening in agriculture, where commodity grains are tended by computer-run tractors as farming entrepreneurs seek more value in heritage, organic, local and other specialty crops. This has been manifested in the stunning proliferation of apple varieties in our stores over the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every other major shift in economic order has made an enormous impact on the nature of personal and family life, and this one probably will, too. Rather than undertake one career for our entire working lives, with minimal failure allowed, many of us will be forced to experiment with several careers, frequently changing course as the market demands -- and not always succeeding in our new efforts. In the corporate era, most people borrowed their reputations from the large institutions they affiliated themselves with: their employers, perhaps, or their universities. Our own personal reputations will now matter more, and they will be far more self-made. As career trajectories and earnings become increasingly volatile, gender roles will fragment further, and many families will spend some time in which the mother is a primary breadwinner and the father is underemployed and at home with the children. It will be harder to explain what you do for a living to acquaintances. The advice of mentors, whose wisdom is ascribed to a passing age, will mean less and less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To succeed in the innovation era, says Daron Acemoglu, a prominent M.I.T. economist, we will need, above all, to build a new set of institutions, something like the societal equivalent of those office parks in Sunnyvale, that help us stay flexible in the midst of turbulent lives. We'll need modern insurance and financial products that encourage us to pursue entrepreneurial ideas or the education needed for a career change. And we'll need incentives that encourage us to take these risks; we won't take them if we fear paying the full cost of failure. Acemoglu says we will need a far stronger safety net, because a society that encourages risk will intrinsically be wealthier over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History is filled with examples of societal innovation, like the United States Constitution and the eight-hour workday, that have made many people better off. These beneficial changes tend to come, Acemoglu told me, when large swaths of the population rally together to demand them. He says it's too early to fully understand exactly what sorts of governing innovations we need today, because the new economic system is still emerging and questions about it remain: How many people will be displaced by robots and mobile apps? How many new jobs will be created? We can't build the right social institutions until we know the precise problem we're solving. ''I don't think we are quite there yet,'' he told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, those with power and wealth resist any significant shift in the existing institutions. Robber barons fought many of the changes of the Progressive Era, and Wall Street fought the reforms of the 1930s. Today, the political system seems incapable of wholesale reinvention. But Acemoglu said that could change in an instant if enough people demand it. In 1900, after all, it was impossible to predict the rise of the modern corporation, labor unions, Social Security and other transformative institutions that shifted gains from the wealthy to workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are a strange species, at once risk-averse and thrill-seeking, terrified of failure but eager for new adventure. If we discover ways to share those risks and those rewards, then we could conceivably arrive somewhere better. The pre-modern era was all risk and no reward. The corporate era had modest rewards and minimal risks. If we conquer our fear of failure, we can, just maybe, have both.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both operations carried considerable risks, because they could have toppled the probe or pushed it out into the void. But without the maneuvers, the Philae lander, which made history by touching down on a comet on Wednesday, risked skipping a key scientific experiment and running out of power.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, the scientists posted: ''First comet drilling is a fact!'' Since landing on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko some 311 million miles from Earth, the lander has performed a series of tests and sent reams of data, including photographs, back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the space agency said late Friday that the batteries eventually depleted and without enough sunlight to recharge them, Philae fell into ''idle mode,'' and all instruments and most of the systems on board shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before falling silent, however, the spacecraft was able ''to transmit all science data gathered during the first science sequence,'' said Stephan Ulamec, the lander's manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not clear whether the rotation had succeeded in putting the lander's solar panels out of the shadow. Scientists are likely to know for sure early Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists learned on Thursday that not only had Philae unexpectedly bounced twice before coming to rest untethered to the surface, but photographs indicated it was next to a cliff that largely blocked sunlight from reaching two of its three solar panels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this achievement, a comet is no longer a mysterious and sometimes frightening spray of light across the night sky, but another member of the solar system to be explored, like the moon and Mars. The technology of landing on a comet, with its wisps of gravity, could be applied to future efforts to mine asteroids.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain, described the touchdown on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a 2.5-mile-wide ball of rock, ice and dust moving faster than 40,000 miles an hour, as ''a big step for human civilization.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our ambitious Rosetta mission has secured another place in the history books,'' Mr. Dordain said at a news conference. ''Not only is it the first to rendezvous with and orbit a comet, but it is now also the first to deliver a probe to a comet's surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists, one of the central mysteries that Rosetta will explore is whether Earth's oceans are filled with melted comets. Since the rocky bits that came together to form the planet were dry, water has to have come from somewhere else. One possibility is that comets slamming into the Earth early on seeded it with water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of the touchdown of the 220-pound lander, named Philae, arrived at the mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, at 5:03 p.m. local time (11:03 a.m. Eastern time). Cheers erupted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two harpoons that should have fired into the comet did not, and the lander may not be secured to the surface. Dr. Ulamec said fluctuations in the radio link and the generation of power by the solar panels suggested that Philae may have bounced off the surface before settling down again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe today we didn't just land once, we even landed twice,'' Dr. Ulamec said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As expected, the Rosetta orbiter moved out of the line of sight of Philae, breaking radio communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter is to re-establish the radio link in the next day, and mission managers hope then to better understand the stability of Philae's footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the lander and its 10 instruments have begun 64 hours of scientific operations before its batteries drain. Solar panels will recharge the batteries, allowing intermittent operations over the coming months, about an hour every two days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing culminated a tense day as Rosetta maneuvered to the correct position to let Philae go -- moments of celebration were interspersed with long, quiet stretches of waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation proceeded despite a few small glitches and one potential showstopper problem: failure of a thruster that was to fire after touchdown to press the lander against the comet's surface. A pin was supposed to break a wax seal on the gas tank, but repeated attempts did not succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the thruster, the washing-machine-size Philae would have to rely on ice screws on its landing legs and the harpoons to anchor it to the comet. The thruster, which was to shoot a stream of nitrogen gas, was intended to counteract not just the possibility of Philae bouncing off the surface but also the upward kick from the firing of the harpoons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers decided to proceed because there was no way to repair it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philae detached on schedule, for a seven-hour descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was some worrying a couple of hours later when the lander was about 10 minutes late in re-establishing communications with the orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers could not do anything; the readings they saw on their computer screens reflected what had occurred 28 minutes earlier -- the time it took a radio signal to travel the 316 million miles from Rosetta to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon they received photos -- a blurry image of Rosetta's solar array taken by Philae about 50 seconds after separation, and then a sharper image by Rosetta of the descending Philae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see the lander going down on the right track,'' said Andrea Accomazzo, the flight director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was more waiting, with amusing updates via the <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> accounts of Rosetta and Philae. ''Finally! I'm stretching my legs after more than 10 years. Landing gear deployed!'' read a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> posting from Philae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The web comic XKCD also provided real-time updates, even mentioning the problem with the nitrogen thruster. In the comic, Rosetta told Philae that mission control was worried about the thruster, and the lander responded, ''I really hope harpoons work on comets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The harpoons turned out to be a valid concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some indications that they might not have been fired, which could mean that we are sitting in soft material and we are not anchored,'' Dr. Ulamec said. ''We have to analyze what is the actual situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The XKCD comic updated: ''Do harpoons work on comets? Don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Philae is working, and the instruments have already sent back some images and data. But if it is not anchored, Philae may not operate as long as hoped -- the original goal was next March -- as emissions of dust and gas grow as the comet moves nearer to the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the lander cannot complete the full mission, managers have said, Rosetta will still be a resounding success. Planetary scientists have never looked at a comet so close up for so long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system. Rosetta is named after the Rosetta Stone, the engraved block that was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics, and scientists hope the spacecraft's observations will offer important clues to how the solar system came together 4.5 billion years ago. (Philae was an island, now submerged in Lake Nasser, where an obelisk provided clues to solving the Rosetta Stone.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous missions have zoomed by comets at high speeds, providing only brief examinations. By contrast, Rosetta will be a constant companion as Comet 67P approaches the sun, swings around and heads out again, its instruments potentially providing more than two years of data.</p>

Parker, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., is the deputy principal investigator for an ultraviolet spectrograph instrument on the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Rosetta spacecraft, which is orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko. Dr. Parker was not working on the Rosetta project at the very beginning, more than two decades ago, but he has been working on it for a long time, since 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Parker is in Tucson, at a meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>'s Division of Planetary Sciences, a major gathering of scientists interested in the bodies that fill the solar system. He, and many others there, will be tuned in early Wednesday when a 220-pound lander named Philae detaches from Rosetta and tries to land on the comet. We asked him about this ambitious maneuver and what it could mean for our understanding of the solar system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you think the landing will succeed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I do. I'm optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why bother landing on a comet? What do we hope to learn?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We have only observed comets from afar. Even the previous spacecraft flybys have been brief and could only study the comet by what they saw remotely. It is like the difference between what you can learn taking pictures from an airplane versus a geologist digging directly into the ground. We will learn about the chemical and physical properties of the surface. We will measure gases as they directly escape from the ground. We will pick up samples from the surface and put them in an oven to bake out and analyze the chemicals. We will learn the ''ground truth'' of how the chemicals we measure in the gas around the comet are related to the chemicals in the comet. I should also mention, it will take those samples from below the surface, so it will be able to see how the surface differs from deeper layers (up to about 23 centimeters, or a little more than nine inches, below the surface).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why haven't we ever done this before?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There always has to be a first time: So this is the first time to land on a comet. It is incredibly difficult with the low gravity, the unknown surface, the motion of the comet and spacecraft, and the lack of an active control system to land (having that would have made the lander much heavier and more complex). Simply put: If it was easy, it would have been done already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. When did this start to seem like a not-crazy or not-impossible feat?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. To me, when Rosetta woke up after two and a half years of hibernation -- nearly completely shut off and silent in the cold distances of the solar system. Not only was I pleased the spacecraft woke up, I'm impressed all of the instruments are working. Nobody woke up dead. That is when it really struck me: This nearly impossible feat may actually work!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. After working on this for more than 15 years, is it hard for you to believe that Rosetta is finally at the comet now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. That selfie that shows the jet coming off of it -- that gave to me the most profound sense of presence, that we were really there. We, as represented by the Rosetta spacecraft, were really there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How was this comet chosen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It was not the original target choice. The original target for the mission was the comet Wirtanen. But the original launch of Rosetta was delayed (because the launch before Rosetta's failed, so they took time to review what happened to make sure the Rosetta launch would not fail). That delay made us lose the window of opportunity to reach comet Wirtanen. So there were meetings of the science team to select another target, one that was reachable and scientifically interesting. That is how Comet 67P was selected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are the instruments aboard?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The best reference for the lander is on the E.S.A. website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For both the lander and the orbiter, in very broad terms, there are instruments to measure:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Chemical makeup of the gas and dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The plasma (ionized atoms and molecules).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The properties of the surface (temperature and electrical properties).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The interior makeup of the comet (via the Consert instrument, which will do ''radio sounding'' of the comet's interior).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* How the surface and the coma (the field of gas and dust around the comet) interact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* How the coma interacts with the solar wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are the changes we expect to see as the comet pulls closer to the sun?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The amount of gas and dust coming from the comet will increase significantly. This will make flying around it (and keeping the instruments on Rosetta safe) a big challenge. The forces against and dragging on the spacecraft may be stronger than the gravitational forces, making it impossible to do a normal ''orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What was the trickiest engineering challenge in developing the lander and landing plan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I don't know the answer to that. You need to ask someone on the lander team. My guess would be: How do you make a lander stick on the ground when you don't know what the ground will be like (Icy? Dusty? Hard? Soft?) and don't have a lot of control over where it lands (Steep? Flat? On a boulder?)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The E.S.A. website has more frequently asked questions on the Rosetta orbiter and Philae lander missions, along with a Rosetta blog and livestream information.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three slingshot flybys of Earth to fling it at ever faster speeds to catch up with its target, Rosetta was so far from the sun that its solar arrays could not generate enough electricity, and it was, by design, put into hibernation for two and a half years.</p>

In the months since, Rosetta has snapped photographs just 4.5 miles above the craggy surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it is attempting its greatest feat yet: drop a small lander onto the comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, at 3:35 a.m. Eastern time, the 220-pound lander, named Philae, detached from Rosetta and began to be pulled downward by the comet's gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philae will be aimed at a landing site that covers about a third of a square mile; the area looks relatively smooth and clear of boulders but is still close to streams of dust and gas shooting off the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven hours later, give or take some minutes, Philae is to bump onto the surface. The comet, 2.5 miles wide, is so small and its gravity so slight that even after that long fall, Philae will be traveling no faster than walking pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep the lander from bouncing, thrusters will fire for 15 seconds, pressing it against the surface, and a harpoon will shoot into the comet to anchor Philae.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it succeeds, scientists will have a breathtaking view from the surface of a comet. If it fails, mission managers say, Rosetta will still be a resounding success with the slew of data coming back from the orbiter. Planetary scientists have never had a look at a comet so close up for so long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous spacecraft missions have zoomed by comets at high speeds, providing only brief examinations. By contrast, Rosetta will be a constant companion as Comet 67P approaches the sun, swings around and heads out again, its instruments potentially providing more than two years of data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will watch this comet evolve,'' Matt Taylor, the project scientist, said during a news briefing last week. ''It's never been done before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at its brightest, Comet 67P will not be visible to the naked eye from Earth. At its closest point to the sun, it is still as far away as Earth. At the other end of its 6.5-year orbit, it is as far from the sun as Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the changes on Comet 67P have been considerable already. Rosetta initially measured about 0.3 liters of water coming off the comet every second, Dr. Taylor said. ''This is increasing,'' he said. ''We're talking of kilos per second now coming off.'' (A liter of water has a mass of one kilogram.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the middle of next year, the comet will be spraying hundreds of liters of water a second, Dr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comet has already provided a number of surprising findings, beginning with its shape. Instead of something roughly round, ''we saw the duck,'' Dr. Taylor said, referring to Comet 67P's two-lobed structure that somewhat resembles a rubber bathtub toy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the gases that Rosetta has detected coming off the comet are hydrogen sulfide (the scent of rotten eggs), ammonia, methane, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde. ''It may be not be the perfume that some of us would choose to wear,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''It's a bit smelly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''At least there's some alcohol, which some of us might enjoy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or not -- the alcohol in the comet is methanol, also known as wood alcohol, which is poisonous and can cause blindness when imbibed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In preparation for the landing operation, Rosetta has moved farther from the comet. A few hours before letting go of Philae, it took a sharp turn toward the comet on a not-quite collision course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get the lander to the selected site, Rosetta has to drop Philae at the right time at the right spot at an altitude of 14 miles from the comet's center while traveling at the right velocity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after Philae is let go, the mission managers can only be helpless onlookers. The thrusters are not capable of making any midcourse corrections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We cannot actively steer the trajectory of the landing on descent,'' said Andrea Accomazzo, the flight director. ''That's the part that worries me most, because I have no control.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 13, 2014, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the Rosetta orbiter's mission to put a lander on a comet referred incorrectly to the timing of one part of the mission. Rosetta was set to take a sharp turn toward the comet in the early hours of Wednesday, Eastern time, not on Tuesday. (Rosetta successfully made the turn.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDA comet that zipped past Mars last month dumped tons of dust into the planet's atmosphere, providing a spectacular light show, scientists said Friday in presenting initial scientific findings from the flyby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Schneider, a <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span> planetary scientist working on NASA's Maven orbiter mission, estimated that thousands of shooting stars -- specks of cometary dust burning up in the atmosphere -- streaked across the Martian sky that night.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's extremely rare in human history, and it would have been truly stunning to the human eye,'' Dr. Schneider said during a NASA news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlighting the limitations of robotic explorers, neither of NASA's Martian rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity, were able to observe the shooting stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got all these high-tech robots around,'' Dr. Schneider said, ''but I have to say, it might be the most sensitive scientific instrument of all to have a human lying outside with dark-adapted vision looking up at that sky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity and Curiosity were able to snap photographs of the comet, Siding Spring, as it passed within 87,000 miles of Mars on Oct. 19. ''Curiosity and Opportunity don't take movies,'' said James L. Green, director of NASA's planetary sciences division. ''They just weren't designed to be able to do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbiting spacecraft, however, vividly observed the effects of the dust. Instruments on the Maven orbiter, which fortuitously arrived weeks before the comet, looked at the upper Martian atmosphere, and afterward, a bright color of ultraviolet light associated with magnesium appeared. Other colors showed the presence of iron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are not what you expect for atmospheric ingredients,'' said Dr. Schneider, the lead scientist for the Maven instrument that made those observations, ''but they are what you expect from comet dust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Maven instrument detected sodium, potassium, manganese, nickel, chromium and zinc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schneider said that magnesium is typically 10 percent by weight of comet dust, leading to an estimate of thousands of kilograms of dust showering on Mars in about an hour. If that material arrived in pieces the size of sand grains, ''you can make quite a meteor shower,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A radar instrument on the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Mars Express orbiter observed in the atmosphere an additional layer of electrons, the result of falling dust particles burning up. ''This is extremely unusual,'' said Donald A. Gurnett, a physics professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Iowa</span> who is the lead investigator for the instrument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the changes in the Martian atmosphere dissipated within hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA and E.S.A. orbiters were positioned on the opposite side of Mars when the peak of comet dust arrived. Traveling at 126,000 miles per hour, even a small particle could have damaged or destroyed a spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet Siding Spring, named after the observatory in Australia where it was first identified, in January 2013, originated from the Oort Cloud, a ball of icy debris about a light-year away. Although several Oort Cloud comets fly through the inner solar system each year, by the time they are seen, there is not enough time to send a spacecraft to study them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comets that have been studied up close, like Halley's Comet, are closer in and return to the inner solar system every few years or decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Siding Spring and its close encounter with Mars -- less than half the distance between Earth and the moon -- the spacecraft were already there to conduct the first close-up observations of an Oort Cloud comet. Images taken by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed the comet's nucleus was smaller than the expected 1.2 miles, and it was rotating once every eight hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> is finishing preparations for a high-risk, high-reward attempt to place a small lander on a comet next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its Rosetta spacecraft arrived at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August. On Wednesday, a 220-pound lander named Philae is to detach from Rosetta for a seven-hour descent to the surface of the 2.5-mile-wide comet, tugged down by its gravitational pull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Philae is on its way, it has no way to adjust its trajectory, and the mission managers admit the attempt could go awry if the lander ends up on a boulder or in a hole. ''We have to be a bit lucky,'' said Andrea Accomazzo, the flight director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 13, 2014, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the comet Siding Spring and its flyby of Mars referred incompletely to the source of pictures that were taken of the comet on Oct. 19. Both Martian rovers -- Opportunity and Curiosity -- photographed the comet; the pictures were not solely from Opportunity.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Substantiating suspicions right after the spectacular fireball that destroyed a rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station, the manufacturer of the rocket said Wednesday that the fault most likely lay in Soviet-era rocket engines that powered the first stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 28, the Antares rocket, loaded with about 5,000 pounds of supplies, equipment and experiments, exploded about 15 seconds after rising off a launching pad at Wallops Island, Va. Nobody was injured.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., which has a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to take cargo to the space station, said Wednesday that its preliminary analysis pointed to a failure of a turbopump, which pushes high-pressure fluid into the engine's combustion chamber. The first stage of the rocket uses two AJ26 engines, which are refurbished from ones originally built in the 1970s for a Soviet moon mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call on Wednesday with financial analysts, David W. Thompson, Orbital's chief executive, described what he called the company's ''go-forward approach.'' He said Orbital would probably discontinue the use of the AJ26 engines and accelerate the development of a next-generation Antares rocket using a different engine. The first flight of the revised Antares would be in 2016. The company did not say which engine it would use, but one possibility is a solid-fuel rocket motor from <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, also known as ATK, which Orbital is seeking to merge with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Orbital intends to fulfill its NASA contract by launching its Cygnus cargo spacecraft on top of another company's rocket. Mr. Thompson said Orbital was talking to three such companies, two American and one European. The change would incur no additional cost for NASA, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson said he also did not expect ''any significant adverse financial impacts'' on Orbital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a more powerful rocket, more cargo could be delivered aboard the Cygnus, and Orbital is looking to consolidate the launchings remaining on its contract, from five to four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect to work with NASA to determine the most favorable combination for one or two gap-filler missions using third-party launch vehicles,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''and are aiming to make final decisions on the best way forward over the course of the coming month.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Orbital announced the investigation board that will look at the Antares failure. David Steffy, chief engineer of Orbital's advanced programs group, will lead the group. The six other members include Wayne Hale, a former program manager for NASA's space shuttles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Aimée Dorr, provost and executive vice president of the university, and Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president, said in an Oct. 29 letter to the acting director of the observatory, Claire Max of the University of California, Santa Cruz, ''We are rescinding our previous requirements that Lick Observatory become self supporting.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lick, which started operations in 1888, is the oldest mountaintop observatory in the West, located on Mount Hamilton, about 30 miles south of San Francisco. In recent years it has played a pivotal role in the discovery of dark energy, which resulted in a Nobel Prize in 2011, and of planets around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lick costs the university about $1.3 million a year to operate, money that the university said was needed in a time of declining state support for new ventures like the mighty Keck telescopes it owns with Caltech on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the even mightier Thirty Meter Telescope, an international project under construction on Mauna Kea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging widespread interest among astronomers in keeping Lick alive, Provost Dorr and Mr. Brostrom wrote that they had never said they intended to close Lick and that recent budget plans suggested it could continue to operate without wrecking other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Indeed,'' they wrote, ''we see the Lick, Keck and Thirty Meter Telescope Observatories as an integrated ecosystem that can together maintain and grow U.C.'s leadership in astronomy.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the great space epics of the past, Christopher Nolan's ''Interstellar'' distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth. Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' blended the technological awe of the Apollo era with the trippy hopes and terrors of the Age of Aquarius. George Lucas's first ''Star Wars'' trilogy, set not in the speculative future but in the imaginary past, answered the malaise of the '70s with swashbuckling nostalgia. ''Interstellar,'' full of visual dazzle, thematic ambition, geek bait and corn (including the literal kind), is a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying to jot down notes by the light of the <span class="companylink">Imax</span> screen, where lustrous images (shot by Hoyte van Hoytema and projected from real 70-millimeter film) flickered, I lost count of how many times the phrase ''I'm sorry'' was uttered -- by parents to children, children to parents, sisters to brothers, scientists to astronauts and astronauts to one another. The whole movie can be seen as a plea for forgiveness on behalf of our foolish, dreamy species. We messed everything up, and we feel really bad about it. Can you please give us another chance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility that such a ''you'' might be out there, in a position to grant clemency, is one of the movie's tantalizing puzzles. Some kind of message seems to be coming across the emptiness of space and along the kinks in the fabric of time, offering a twinkle of hope amid humanity's rapidly darkening prospects. For most of ''Interstellar,'' the working hypothesis is that a benevolent alien race, dwelling somewhere on the far side of a wormhole near one of the moons of Saturn, is sending data across the universe, encrypted advice that just may save us if we can decode it fast enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What our planet and species need saving from is a slow-motion environmental catastrophe. Rather than explain how this bleak future arrived through the usual montages of mayhem, Mr. Nolan (who wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan) drops us quietly into what looks like a fairly ordinary reality. We are in a rural stretch of North America, a land of battered pickup trucks, dusty bluejeans and wind-burned farmers scanning the horizon for signs of a storm. Talking-head testimony from old-timers chronicles what sounds like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, until we spot a laptop on the table being set for family dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of the family in question is Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a widower who lives with his two children and his father-in-law (John Lithgow). Once a NASA pilot, Cooper now grows corn, the only thing that will grow after a blight has wiped out most of the planet's other crops. The human population has shrunk to a desperate remnant, but the survivors cling to the habits and rituals of normal life. For now, there is plenty of candy and soda and beer (thanks to all that corn); there are parent-teacher conferences after school; and Cooper's farmhouse is full of books and toys. But the blight is spreading, the dust storms are growing worse, and the sense of an ending is palpable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nolans cleverly conflate scientific denialism with technophobia, imagining a fatalistic society that has traded large ambition for small-scale problem solving and ultimate resignation. But Christopher Nolan, even in his earlier, more modestly budgeted films, has never been content with the small scale. His imagination is large; his eye seeks out wide, sweeping vistas; and if he believes in anything, it is ambition. As it celebrates the resistance to extinction -- taking as its touchstone Dylan Thomas's famous villanelle ''Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,'' with its repeated invocation of ''rage against the dying of the light'' -- ''Interstellar'' becomes an allegory of its own aspirations, an argument for grandeur, scale and risk, on screen and off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dick Cavett, a son of Nebraska, used to ask (quoting Abe Burrows), ''How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm, after they've seen the farm?'' Cooper and ''Interstellar'' are clearly marked for something other than agrarian pursuits, but the first section of the movie is the richest and most haunting, establishing a delicately emotional tone and clear moral and dramatic stakes for the planet-hopping to follow. Cooper is devoted to his children, in particular his daughter, Murph, played as a young girl by the preternaturally alert and skeptical Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain. When her father is recruited for a secret NASA mission to search for a habitable new planet, Murph is devastated by his departure. Her subsequent scientific career is both a tribute to his memory and a way of getting even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nolans are fond of doubled characters and mirrored plots, and so ''Interstellar'' is built around twinned father-daughter stories. Among Cooper's colleagues on board the spaceship is Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway), whose father, also called Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), has developed the theories behind their quest. He and Murph remain on the ground, crunching the numbers and growing older in the usual earthly way, while Cooper and the younger Brand, thanks to relativity, stay pretty much the same age. (Cooper's son, Tom, played by Timothée Chalamet as a boy, matures into Casey Affleck). The two pairs of daughters and dads perform variations on the theme of paternal and filial love, finding delicate and moving passages of loyalty, rebellion, disillusionment and acceptance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of other stuff happens, too, as it tends to out in space. A cynical critic might suppose that the last two hours of ''Interstellar'' were composed in a fit of spoiler hysteria. Nondisclosure pleas from the studio have been unusually specific. Forget about telling you what happens: I'm not even supposed to tell you who's in the thing, aside from the people you've seen on magazine covers. I guess I can disclose that Cooper and Brand are accompanied by two other astronauts, played by a witty, scene-stealing David Gyasi and a deadpan Wes Bentley, and also by a wry robot who speaks in the voice of Bill Irwin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The touches of humor those characters supply are welcome, if also somewhat stingily rationed. Nobody goes to a Christopher Nolan movie for laughs. But it is hard to imagine that his fans -- who represent a fairly large segment of the world's population -- will be disappointed by ''Interstellar.'' I haven't always been one of them, but I've always thought that his skill and ingenuity were undeniable. He does not so much transcend genre conventions as fulfill them with the zeal of a true believer. It may be enough to say that ''Interstellar'' is a terrifically entertaining science-fiction movie, giving fresh life to scenes and situations we've seen a hundred times before, and occasionally stumbling over pompous dialogue or overly portentous music. (In general, the score, by Hans Zimmer, is exactly as portentous as it needs to be.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the film is more than that. It is in the nature of science fiction to aspire to more, to ascend fearlessly toward the sublime. You could think of ''Interstellar,'' which has a lot to say about gravity, as the anti-''Gravity.'' That movie, which would fit inside this one twice, stripped away the usual sci-fi metaphysics, presenting space travel as an occasion for quiet wonder and noisy crisis management. Mr. Nolan takes the universe and eternity itself as his subject and his canvas, brilliantly exploiting cinema's ability to shift backward and sideways in time (through flashbacks and cross cuts), even as it moves relentlessly forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''Gravity'' and ''Interstellar'' are both ultimately about the longing for home, about voyages into the unknown that become odysseys of return. And ''Interstellar'' may take its place in the pantheon of space movies because it answers an acute earthly need, a desire not only for adventure and novelty but also, in the end, for comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Interstellar'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A few expletives, a lot of peril.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space travel has long been the preserve of governments and sci-fi fans, but in recent years a crop of new commercial ventures, often backed by billionaire entrepreneurs, has sought to get into the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of so-called thrillonaires has only grown, along with their ambitions: Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who set up Blue Origin to lower the cost of space technology; Elon Musk, who founded <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> with the aim of going to Mars one day; and Richard Branson, who started the space tourism company Virgin Galactic.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But two recent accidents involving commercial rockets have underscored the high risks and soaring costs involved in any spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, a Virgin Galactic space plane exploded during a test flight over the Mojave Desert, killing one pilot and injuring another. Days earlier, an <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> rocket carrying a supply vessel to the International Space Station blew up seconds after it was launched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both accidents are under investigation. Although they were unrelated, their occurrence just days apart was a stark reminder that the path to space is just as arduous for private companies as it is for government-funded programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The engineering and physics of space tend to be unforgiving, no matter who is doing this,'' said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span> and a former assistant administrator at the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The common thread between these new space initiatives is that they all are looking for ways to sharply cut the cost of spaceflight. Without that, analysts say, there is no realistic prospect of making spaceflights both routine and affordable in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you are seeing playing out are different experiments, by different groups, trying different approaches,'' Mr. Pace said. ''To me, this does not call into question the basic logic of relying more on the private sector.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push to privatize spaceflight is in part borne of necessity. After pioneering space exploration and landing on the moon with programs like Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, NASA has had to adapt to tighter budgets and redefine its mission. Today, one of its main goals is to encourage and fund the development of commercial space entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori B. Garver, a former deputy administrator at NASA and one of the most prominent advocates for commercial space during her tenure, said that public funds should be focused on activities that advance technology and provide public benefits to all, like planetary science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, she said, the government should encourage private companies to move ahead and find innovative ways of reducing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my view, the private sector has the same incentive, or even more, to get things right as the government does,'' Ms. Garver said. ''If we only trusted risky things to the government, we would only fly in government-owned and operated airplanes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the current commercial operations have some form of government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> is operating under a $1.9 billion contract from NASA to deliver cargo to the space station. Its Antares rocket exploded on the third of eight resupply missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same is true of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which was recently awarded $2.4 billion by NASA to build a transportation system for astronauts within the next three years. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> was also the recipient of an earlier $1.4 billion contract to deliver cargo to the space station. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> also won a NASA contract for $4.6 billion to build a spacecraft capable of flying astronauts to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> have sought to reduce costs in different ways. Orbital's rockets use a pair of refurbished engines built in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. The engines were intended for Soviet rockets destined for the moon, but were never used and lay in storage for decades. The engines were refurbished by an American company and incorporated into the Antares rocket by Orbital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, by contrast, builds its engines for its Falcon 9 rocket and aims to reduce costs, in the long term, by reusing the rocket. The company has succeeded in firing a test rocket called Grasshopper, having it hover at around 2,400 feet and then returning it to its point of launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But its efforts to land Falcon 9 rockets have so far been unsuccessful, though the company says it is getting closer. In August, a bigger test rocket trying a high-altitude test was destroyed shortly after takeoff. No one was injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is ''looking for cheaper access to space,'' said Marco A. Caceres, a space analyst at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Virginia. The trouble, he said, is that reliability and price are often tied together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may be unreasonable to expect to pay under a certain amount to get a reliable vehicle,'' Mr. Caceres said. ''That comes at a cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic is an exception to the model of government-funded launchers. The company has been working on an experimental vessel to take paying passengers to the edge of space and back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, called SpaceShipTwo, was designed to be launched from a plane, then rocket up to its apogee at about 62 miles, an altitude considered the boundary of outer space. At the top of its ascent, two tail booms would rotate upward into a so-called feathered position intended to create more drag and stability, and allow the plane to descend gently back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal accident investigators said that the plane had shifted early into this high-drag configuration shortly before its accident on Friday for reasons that are still unclear. The investigators said it was far too soon to draw any conclusions about the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investigators have located almost all of the important pieces of the space plane, which had fallen along a debris field five miles long. That included the fuel tanks and the engine, which were ''intact, showed no signs of burn through, no signs of being breached,'' said Christopher A. Hart, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is much more we don't know, and our investigation is far from over,'' Mr. Hart said during a news conference Sunday night at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement Sunday, Virgin Galactic responded to criticism that the design of SpaceShipTwo was flawed and that the test flights were reckless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At Virgin Galactic, we are dedicated to opening the space frontier, while keeping safety as our 'North Star,' '' the company said. ''This has guided every decision we have made over the past decade, and any suggestion to the contrary is categorically untrue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caceres said the new space entrepreneurs were good at creating excitement about their ventures. Before Friday's accident, about 700 people had reserved seats on Virgin Galactic, with tickets costing $250,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are talking about a brand new era of space,'' Mr. Caceres said. ''You have personalities like Richard Branson and Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who are not engineers. These are different kinds of people and they can generate a lot of excitement and capital investors who are willing to give you a lot of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he added, ''the downside is that if you have problems, you have all this attention focused on you.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDA team of about 15 investigators from the <span class="companylink">National Transportation Safety Board</span> began its inquiry on Saturday into the crash of a Virgin Galactic space plane on Friday in the Mojave Desert that killed the co-pilot and severely injured the pilot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Saturday evening at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, Christopher A. Hart, the acting chairman of the board, said the path of debris was five miles long.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the wreckage is dispersed like that, that indicates the likelihood of in-flight breakup,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Branson, the billionaire entrepreneur who started Virgin Galactic with the goal of taking tourists on short flights into space, arrived at Mojave on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are determined to find out what went wrong,'' Mr. Branson said during a news conference at the spaceport on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scaled Composites, the company that designed and built SpaceShipTwo, identified the crew member who died as Michael Alsbury, 39, the co-pilot on the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot, who survived by parachuting from the doomed craft, is Peter Siebold, 43. ''He is alert and talking with his family and doctors,'' Scaled Composites said in a news release Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the test Friday morning, SpaceShipTwo was lifted by a carrier airplane, WhiteKnightTwo, to an altitude of about 45,000 feet before being released. Soon after the space plane's motor ignited, something went wrong. The plane fell to the ground in pieces about 20 miles northeast of Mojave. This was the first flight test of SpaceShipTwo using a redesigned rocket motor that used a fuel that was plastic-based instead of rubber-based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plane was flying southwest when it broke up, Mr. Hart said, and investigators found parts of the craft's tail farthest to the northeast. The next parts found along the flight path were the main fuselage, the cockpit, and at the southwest end of the debris field, the rocket motor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hart said there were six cameras on SpaceShipTwo, but he did not know how many had been recovered. There were also three cameras on WhiteKnightTwo, and other aircraft following the space plane also collected video and radar data. The investigators also have access to extensive telemetry data and images from a long-range camera tracking the flight from Edwards Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were quite a few sources we have that aren't normally available to us on accident investigations,'' Mr. Hart said. He added that investigators would probably spend four to seven days at the site collecting information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A final report on the accident would take about a year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 700 people, including celebrities like Ashton Kutcher, Tom Hanks and Katy Perry, have reserved seats with Virgin Galactic. The price of a ticket is $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do understand the risks involved, and we are not going to push on blindly,'' Mr. Branson said. ''To do so would be an insult to all those affected by this tragedy. We're going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance, and then move forward together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, anyone who ever wants a refund will get a refund,'' Mr. Branson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Branson said that on Friday one new customer signed up for a flight after news of the crash, to show support for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company had not spent any of the $80 million it has collected in deposits. Instead, the money ''gave us the confidence to do the program, because these people were so committed,'' Mr. Branson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the second time tragedy has struck the spaceport in connection with Scaled Composites; in July 2007, three people died when a rocket system test went awry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start of commercial flights, already years later than Mr. Branson had desired, will be delayed again; in September, he expressed hope that flights would begin next spring. A second space plane is under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More crucially, Virgin Galactic faces a difficult decision about the motor to power the next SpaceShipTwo. Although the investigation has just begun, the new motor is an obvious suspect as the cause of the accident. The company could stick with a design that may have already destroyed one craft. Or it could go back to a design that successfully powered three flights, but that caused vibration problems and may not provide enough thrust to propel the space plane to the 62-mile-high altitude that is generally considered the edge of space -- there, passengers would experience a few moments of weightlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturer of the earlier motor, <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span>, said in a statement on Friday that it had no involvement with the new SpaceShipTwo motor, which it said was developed internally at Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third option would be to switch to a new engine design, a prospect that could take years of development and testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That uncertainty, of course, makes for a longer wait for the company's customers, some of whom may now be wondering if they still want to spend $250,000 on a ride that could be fatal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about Virgin Galactic's future, Mr. Branson paused before finally answering, ''We would love to finish what we started some years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''In the early days of aviation, there were incidents, and then aviation became very safe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the news conference, a reporter asked Mr. Branson if he still planned to be a passenger on the first operational flight. He gave a quick nod yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 4, 2014, Tuesday</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilots, who have not yet been identified, were flying the plane for Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company created by the entrepreneur Richard Branson, and Scaled Composites, the company that designed and built the plane.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pilot was able to parachute from the plane and was taken to a hospital with ''moderate to major injuries,'' said Ray Pruitt, the public information officer for the Kern County sheriff's office in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The test was the first time SpaceShipTwo had flown using a new, plastic-based rocket fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second major accident in a week for the commercial space industry, which has been widely promoted in recent years as an alternative to costly government programs. On Tuesday, an unmanned rocket launched by <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., which was carrying cargo to the International Space Station, exploded 15 seconds after launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SpaceShipTwo and Orbital's rocket are very different in design and purpose, but both are part of an effort to bring private investment into the space business, until now largely the realm of government agencies like NASA and the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic, which hoped to begin tourist flights next spring, already has more than 700 reservations, initially sold for $200,000 a seat before rising to $250,000 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of would-be astronauts includes celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber and Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts said it was too soon to tell when the effort would resume. ''Virgin was out ahead of everyone else for space tourism,'' said Michael Blades, the aerospace and defense industry senior analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan, a market research and consulting firm. ''It will still happen, but it has been pushed way to the right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is just like any kind of other new technology, especially when it comes to flight,'' he continued. ''You have your tests and you have your failures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's accident took place tens of thousands of feet above the desert. As planned, SpaceShipTwo was carried aloft by a larger plane, WhiteKnightTwo, then dropped at about 50,000 feet. In a tourist flight, SpaceShipTwo's rocket engines would take it to the 62-mile-high boundary defined as the edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the smaller plane was released, its motor ignited. The accident appeared to happen 60 to 90 seconds later, said Stuart Witt, the chief executive of Mojave Air and Space Port, where WhiteKnightTwo took off at 9:18 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew something was wrong,'' he said. ''I didn't know what. It wasn't obvious at first.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A radio call reported an anomaly. ''And we waited,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheriff's office received a call after 10 a.m. that an aircraft had gone down about 20 miles northeast of the city of Mojave. ''We have located a debris field,'' Mr. Pruitt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WhiteKnightTwo landed safely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, Mr. Branson said, ''I'm flying to Mojave immediately to be with the team.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic grew out of the success of the Ansari X Prize contest in 2004, for the first privately built and financed craft that could rise above the 62-mile boundary of space. Scaled Composites won the $10 million prize with a smaller version of SpaceShipTwo, an effort financed by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediately after the X Prize, Mr. Branson announced his plans for a spaceship that would carry two pilots and six passengers on suborbital flights -- in which the plane does not go into orbit but offers a few minutes of weightlessness at the top of an arcing trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Mr. Branson has repeatedly said he hoped commercial flights would begin soon. This is the second time tragedy has struck the spaceport in connection with Scaled Composites; in July 2007, a rocket system test went awry, killing three people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently, he said that with the resumption of powered test flights, he hoped the first commercial flights would take off next spring. He and his family plan to be the passengers on the first operational flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although SpaceShipTwo had flown 54 previous test flights, all but three were unpowered tests in which it glided to the ground. This was the fourth time its motor was ignited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Virgin Galactic announced it was switching to the plastic-based fuel from the rubber-based one it had used. Friday's flight was the first powered by the new motor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous version was problematic, causing strong vibrations in the spacecraft. In an article published last month in Popular Mechanics, Brian Binnie, a former test pilot for Scaled, said, ''We had start-up instabilities and we had end-of-burn instabilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While troubleshooting the problem, ''we did everything but break down and pray to God to show us the light of day,'' said Mr. Binnie, who has now moved to <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>, another company at Mojave that is building a suborbital space plane for tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marco Caceres, director of space studies at the Teal Group, a consulting firm, said that ''in an age where it is very expensive to fly these vehicles, the pressure is to do the minimal amount of test flying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So that may be something we have to take a look at,'' he continued. ''Everyone seems to be in need of more money to conduct more flights, so the pressure is to start operational flight too soon. Maybe we are being unreasonable here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia Hynes, director of the New Mexico Space Grant Consortium, who organizes an annual symposium for people in the commercial space industry, said the accident ''helps people understand why it's never been done before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a tough business,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hynes has bought a Virgin Galactic ticket, and the news did not change her intention to fly. ''No, absolutely not,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second SpaceShipTwo plane is currently under construction.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- ''I feel wrung out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the credits rolled on Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller ''Interstellar'' -- all two hours and 49 minutes of it -- at a gala premiere here on Sunday night, those words popped from a young woman about eight rows away from the <span class="companylink">Imax</span> screen. By week's end, many in Hollywood's media corps were feeling much the same.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To open on Wednesday (with some Tuesday evening screenings), Mr. Nolan's apocalyptic space adventure has crashed into the awards circuit amid sharp disagreement about its prospects, merit and meaning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than two weeks ago, the film, which is being distributed in the United States by <span class="companylink">Paramount Pictures</span>, and abroad by <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>., finally surfaced with tastemaker and celebrity showings in California and New York. Until then, ''Interstellar'' had been tagged as a potential powerhouse in the Oscar race. Technically ambitious, loaded with stars -- including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain -- and determined to resolve the fate of mankind, it seemed the stuff of which best pictures were made. Yet a wildly mixed reception now finds the awards crowd slipping from budding consensus to near chaos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't really want to write this review,'' the film blogger David Poland began in his ''Movie City News'' column on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poland, a Nolan fan, called the film's first act ''insufferable.'' He applauded the movie's mysteriously cerebral conclusion but compared the first 110 minutes to ''water torture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Poland's Gurus O' Gold survey had only shortly before ranked ''Interstellar,'' sight unseen, as No. 5 in the best picture race, behind ''Boyhood,'' ''The Imitation Game,'' ''Birdman,'' and ''The Theory of Everything,'' all of which had been knocking around festivals and commercial theaters for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over at the website The Wrap, by contrast, the reviewer Alonso Duralde loved the film's beginning, which he found ''challenging, provocative and gorgeous.'' But that last hour -- the part Mr. Poland admired -- Mr. Duralde called ''a third act of staggering wrongheadedness, along with female characters whose intellect takes a back seat to their exploding emotionalism and rage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrongheadedness notwithstanding, Mr. Duralde's Wrap colleague Steve Pond, also writing on Monday, added to the confusion by insisting that Ms. Chastain ''stands out as a supporting actress contender'' for her time-shifting turn as Mr. McConaughey's scientist-daughter. But Mr. Pond, too, thought the film came up short. ''It isn't the one thing that this year's race has been missing: a front runner,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Variety gave a rave. '' 'Interstellar' reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside 'The Wizard of Oz,' '2001' '' and others, wrote its reviewer, Scott Foundas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd McCarthy, at The Hollywood Reporter, was of two minds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'' 'Interstellar' so bulges with ideas, ambitions, theories, melodrama, technical wizardry, wondrous imagery and core emotions,'' he wrote, ''that it was almost inevitable that some of it would stick while other stuff would fall to the floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking on Wednesday, Mr. McCarthy said the general confusion around ''Interstellar'' probably stemmed from Mr. Nolan's attempt to meld astrophysics with an almost quaint father-daughter film story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It confronted me with the tension between creating an emotional realistic film and one that confronts infinity,'' Mr. McCarthy said, adding, ''I don't think the whole quite meshed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually something of a critics' darling, Mr. Nolan has had, with his previous eight films, which include ''Inception'' and ''Memento,'' an average 86 percent positive score on the Rotten Tomatoes website, which monitors film reviews. As of Wednesday, ''Interstellar'' was holding at a respectable 72 percent, but that reflected scoring methods that put USA Today, for instance, in the plus column, with a review whose headline said the film ''gets lost in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives from <span class="companylink">Paramount</span> declined to discuss a screening strategy that seemed to inflate expectations around Mr. Nolan's movie. While pictures like ''Birdman'' and ''The Theory of Everything'' were eased into public awareness at festivals and elsewhere, ''Interstellar'' screened nowhere until mid-October, when it was quietly shown to military families at Fort Hood, in Texas, in a bow toward its public-service-oriented themes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning Oct. 19, it was then shown to film industry power players and other opinion leaders, including upper-level editors like Norman Pearlstine, the chief content officer of Time Inc., as well as to some street-level bloggers, in a screening blitz that culminated with the Oct. 26 premiere in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently, the idea behind the targeted advance screenings, as opposed to showing the film at festivals, was to crystallize its aura of importance before mainstream critics and reporters weighed in. Somewhat unexpectedly, however, ''a lot of the online guys kind of turned on it,'' noted Kristopher Tapley of hitfix.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we still need to wait,'' added Mr. Tapley, an editor at large, who has watched the film twice and has yet to decide whether it is a miss or a masterpiece ''Remember, the major critics still need to review it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No people were hurt when a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station exploded just after launching Tuesday night -- but the mosquito eggs did not survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Ellis, 13, was across the bay from the launching pad on Wallops Island, Va., less than two miles away, watching as the rocket lifted off. Amid the 5,000 pounds of cargo was an experiment that she and four classmates at Columbia Middle School in Berkeley Heights, N.J., had devised to study whether mosquito larvae can grow in zero gravity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone was just so excited and happy,'' she said. ''You could hear everyone cheering.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was a flash, and the rocket fell. ''It feels like someone smacked you in the chest,'' she said. ''You hear one small explosion, one really large explosion and then two small explosions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, investigators started looking through the wreckage of the Antares rocket, built by the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va., one of two private companies that NASA relies on to take cargo to the station. Four previous Antares launches, three of which went to the space station, were successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a conference call with financial analysts, David W. Thompson, Orbital's chairman and chief executive, said the rocket experienced a catastrophic failure about 15 seconds after liftoff, destroying the rocket and its payload. ''It appears that the launch complex itself was spared from any major damage,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrett E. Pierce, the company's chief financial officer, said the failure would not affect the company's finances this year, because insurance would cover repairs to the launching site and the payments from NASA that might be held back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract from NASA for eight cargo flights, or $237 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the loss would have no immediate effect on the operations of the space station, which has several months of supplies. A Russian cargo rocket successfully launched on Wednesday, as scheduled, and docked at the space station six hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the items lost in the Antares explosion were a suite of student experiments arranged by NanoRacks, a small company in Houston that flies commercial payloads to the space station. Also lost were 29 nanosatellites, the largest weighing about 22 pounds, that the company had arranged to be launched from the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Manber, NanoRacks's managing director, spent the day like an airline customer service agent trying to rebook passengers from a canceled flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're sitting here right now working through the needs of our customers,'' Mr. Manber said. ''What are the priorities of the payloads? Who can rebuild? Who's ready to go?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the other company that NASA has hired to ferry cargo, completed its most recent flight to the station last week, and its next rocket is scheduled to launch in December. Mr. Manber said some of the rebuilt student experiments could be on that flight. Mr. Thompson said he expected that the next Antares launch, set for April, would be delayed by several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he said it was too early to speculate on why the Antares crashed, Mr. Thompson added: ''It will likely not take very long -- I think a period measured in days, not weeks -- for the investigation team to define the handful of most likely causes of the accident. It may take a little longer than that to zero in on the final root cause.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain to be scrutinized are the two engines in the rocket's first stage. They were built in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and early 1970s to power a giant rocket to go to the moon. After NASA's successful moon landings, the Soviets abandoned their effort, and the engines lay in storage for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then an American company, <span class="companylink">Aerojet</span>, bought and refurbished them, and Orbital incorporated them into the Antares design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the engines failed during testing in May, delaying the previous Antares flight. Orbital officials said the company was considering accelerating its plans to replace the old Soviet engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbital has had two other high-profile NASA failures in recent years. In 2009, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory on top of Orbital's Taurus XL rocket was lost when the nose cone protecting the satellite failed to separate, and the satellite crashed into the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, a similar failure destroyed NASA's Glory satellite, which was to have made climate observations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Antares rocket, carrying 5,055 pounds of supplies, science experiments and equipment, lifted off on schedule at 6:22 p.m. from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in eastern Virginia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon after it rose into the sky, there was a flash of an explosion. ''The ascent stopped,'' Frank L. Culbertson Jr., the executive vice president of <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, the maker of the rocket, said during a news conference Tuesday. ''There was some disassembly of the first stage, it looked like, and then it fell to earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one was injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbital, based in Dulles, Va., first launched a 14-story-high Antares rocket on its maiden flight in April last year. It then conducted a demonstration flight to the space station to show NASA the capabilities of the rocket and the cargo spacecraft. Then came two more flights carrying cargo to the space station, part of a program in which NASA has hired private companies to ferry cargo to the space station. Tuesday's launch would have been the third of eight cargo missions under a $1.9 billion contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbital will lead an investigation. Mr. Culbertson said the company would not launch another Antares rocket until it had identified and corrected the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corp</span>., of Hawthorne, Calif., known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, has successfully flown four cargo missions to the space station, the most recent mission ending on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the failure would not cause immediate issues for the space station, which had adequate supplies to last at least until next spring. A Russian supply rocket is set to launch to the space station on Wednesday, and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s next cargo mission is scheduled for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have plenty of capability to support the crew on board,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, the manager of the space station program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, a Russian supply ship failed to reach orbit; space station managers adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By hiring private companies, NASA hoped to reduce costs, improve efficiency and spur a new commercial space industry, and it has taken a similar approach toward launching its astronauts in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA awarded contracts to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> to take astronauts to the space station beginning as early as 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the failure of the Orbital rocket will probably raise questions about whether NASA has done enough to ensure the reliability of the rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Antares rocket carried a more powerful second-stage engine for the first time. The cargo spacecraft was to reach the space station on Sunday. The rocket was also carrying a satellite, also destroyed, for Planetary Resources, a start-up looking to develop technology for mining asteroids.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This occasional column explores topics covered in Science Times 25 years ago to see what has changed, and what has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aero-Space Plane was to be a revolutionary advance beyond the space shuttle.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his 1986 State of the Union address, President Ronald Reagan promised ''a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles Airport and accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low-earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two hours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 3, 1989, an article in Science Times, ''Designing a Plane for the Leap of Space (and Back),'' reported frenetic activity at NASA and the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Scientists and engineers are making rapid progress in developing technologies needed to build a 17,000-mile-an-hour 'space plane' that could escape earth's gravity and circle the globe in 90 minutes,'' the article began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their goal,'' it continued, ''is a space plane that could take off and land from virtually any airport in the world, carry satellites and other space cargo into orbit cheaply, shuttle between the earth and an orbiting space station, or carry a load of bombs deep into enemy territory as fast as an intercontinental missile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents contended the space plane would be far cheaper to operate than the shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were dubious. The <span class="companylink">Air Force</span>, which was providing most of the financing, had already tried to back out, but the National Space Council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, recommended continuing work at a slower pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target for the first flight of the first experimental version, known as the X-30, was originally 1993 but was pushed back to 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25 YEARS LATER The space plane, able to fly by itself to orbit, never took off. The X-30 died in 1994. Smaller-scale hypersonic programs came and went.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was the X-30 technologically feasible?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No, and it's still not,'' said Jess Sponable, a program manager in the tactical technology office at Darpa, the <span class="companylink">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</span>. For X-30 to succeed, infant ideas would have had to have been developed into robust, reliable technologies -- materials that could survive intense temperatures, air-breathing engines that could fly faster and higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, ''absolutely, it was worthwhile,'' Mr. Sponable said, although he added perhaps not worth the more than $1.6 billion spent. ''We learned a lot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pendulum for spacecraft design has since swung away from the cutting edge to the tried and true. The Orion craft, which NASA is building for deep-space missions, is a capsule, just like the one used for the Apollo moon missions but bigger. The two private company designs that NASA chose to take future astronauts to the space station are also capsules. (The loser in that competition was a mini-shuttle offering.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dream of hypersonic space planes continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Darpa, Mr. Sponable heads the XS-1 space plane project. It is not a do-it-all-at-once effort like the 1980s space plane but a much simpler, unmanned vehicle that would serve as a reusable first stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sponable is eager to figure out how to send it up many times, quickly and cheaply; the goal is 10 flights in 10 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want operability No. 1,'' he said. With the quick launches, the issue of cost ''just disappears, because we can't spend a lot of money from Day 1 to Day 2 to Day 3.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darpa has awarded contracts to three industry teams to develop preliminary designs. Mr. Sponable said the decision of a next step would come next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space plane episode illustrates the recurring money woes that have bedeviled NASA for decades: A grandiose plan is announced with fanfare and a burst of financing that fades as delays and cost overruns undercut the optimistic plans. Then a new president or a new NASA administrator changes course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently, the Obama administration canceled plans started under President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon and told NASA to consider an asteroid instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the pattern continues, NASA priorities could zig again after the next president moves into the White House in 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Maps are made with the convention that Earth's north and south are mirrored on the other planets in the solar system. They are orbiting around the sun in the same plane as Earth, called the plane of the ecliptic.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the planets rotate, the ends of their rotational axes are their north and south poles, though some of the planets have a rotational axis that is much more severely tilted than Earth's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like modern terrestrial maps, the maps of bodies in space are oriented with north on top. This somewhat arbitrary choice was almost certainly made because of Earth's magnetic North Pole and because of sailors' age-old reliance on the North Star for navigation in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On other planets, however, magnetic fields are weak or nonexistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably because humankind tends to see itself as being the center of the universe, when scientists started to map the solar system beyond the home planet, the same north/south divisions were kept, with the dividing line being the Earth's equatorial axis. Eventually the definitions were extended to the hemispheres of the galaxy and the hemispheres of the universe itself. C. CLAIBORNE RAY question@nytimes.com</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the way to Mars, Neil Scheibelhut stopped by <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> for mouthwash and dental floss. ''We're picking up some last-minute things,'' he said via cellphone last Wednesday afternoon from the store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheibelhut is not actually an astronaut leaving the earth. But three hours later, he and five other people stepped into a dome-shaped building on a Hawaiian volcano where they will live for the next eight months, mimicking a stay on the surface of Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is part of a NASA-financed study, the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, or Hi-Seas for short. The goal is to examine how well a small group of people, isolated from civilization, can get along and work together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When astronauts finally head toward Mars years from now -- NASA has penciled the 2030s -- it will be a long and lonely journey: about six months to Mars, 500 days on the planet, and then another six months home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, the psychological risks are still not completely understood and not completely corrected for,'' said Kimberly Binsted, a professor of information and <span class="companylink">computer sciences</span> at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the principal investigator for the project. (She is not in the dome.) ''NASA is not going to go until we solve this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isolation can lead to depression. Personality conflicts can spin out of control over the months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How do you select and support astronauts for a mission that will last two to three years in a way that will keep them healthy and performing well?'' Dr. Binsted said. Or as Mr. Scheibelhut put it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm so interested to see how I react. 'I don't know' is the short answer. I think it could go a lot of different ways.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several mock Mars missions have been conducted in recent years. A simulation in Russia in 2010 and 2011 stretched 520 days, most of the duration of an actual mission. Four of the six volunteers developed sleep disorders and became less productive as the experiment progressed. <span class="companylink">The Mars Society</span>, a nonprofit group that promotes human spaceflight, has run short simulations in the Utah desert since 2001 and is looking to do a one-year simulation in the Canadian Arctic beginning in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hi-Seas has already conducted two four-month missions, and next year, six more people will reside for one year inside the dome, a two-story building 36 feet in diameter with about 1,500 square feet of space. It sits in an abandoned quarry at an altitude of 8,000 feet on Mauna Loa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To simulate the operational challenges, the crew members in the Hi-Seas dome are largely cut off. Their communications to the world outside the dome are limited to email, and each message is delayed by 20 minutes before being sent, simulating the lag for communications to travel from Mars to Earth and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every time one of the would-be astronauts or mission control sends a message, at least 40 minutes will elapse before a reply arrives. Real-time conversation is impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a real mission, the lag time would often be considerably shorter as Mars and Earth moved closer together, but Dr. Binsted said, ''We went with the worst case because we're trying to solve the worst-case situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew members are granted some exceptions. They can check a few websites, like their banking accounts, to ensure that their earth lives do not fall apart while they are away. There is also a cellphone for emergency communications; If a hurricane (a distinctly un-Martian weather pattern) were to threaten the dome, as almost occurred over the weekend when Hurricane Ana veered south of Hawaii, mission control would not delay telling the crew to evacuate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 150 people applied to participate. Dr. Binsted said the three men and three women of this Hi-Seas crew were chosen to have a similar mix of experience and backgrounds as real NASA astronauts, and many indeed aspire to go to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commander is Martha Lenio, 34, an entrepreneur looking to start a renewable-energy consulting company. Other crew members are Jocelyn Dunn, 27, a <span class="companylink">Purdue University</span> graduate student; Sophie Milam, 26, a graduate student at the <span class="companylink">University of Idaho</span>; Allen Mirkadyrov, 35, a NASA aerospace engineer; and Zak Wilson, 28, a mechanical engineer who worked on military drone aircraft at <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I dream about being an astronaut, and this might be the closest I ever get,'' Ms. Dunn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilson had previously done a two-week stay at the Mars habitat in Utah. Mr. Scheibelhut had worked on the first Hi-Seas mission as part of the ground support crew. ''I thought it would be really cool to be part of what's going on inside,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their time, each is receiving round-trip airfare to Hawaii, a $11,500 stipend, food and, of course, lodging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the outset, the six appear to get along fine. ''This is a fantastic group of people,'' Mr. Scheibelhut said. ''Right now, everything is wonderful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he recognized that there would be unpleasant patches. ''Eight months -- you're going to have real conflicts you're going to have to work out,'' he said. ''Scientifically speaking, it's going to be really interesting to see what happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Scheibelhut, 38, an Army veteran who served a year in Iraq in 2004, said, ''I've been through worse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this mission, at least, no one will be trying to kill him. ''I hope,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to maintain cohesion among the crew members, but that too can lead to problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They become more independent when they are more cohesive,'' Dr. Binsted said, and an independent-minded crew could start sparring with mission control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers will also be looking for signs of ''third-quarter syndrome.'' At the beginning of the mission, the experience is new and exciting. Then, in the second quarter of the mission, people fall into routines. Near the end, people can look forward to getting out and returning to the real world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the middle, there can be a stretch when routines turn into tedium without end. ''That third quarter can be a bit of a bummer,'' Dr. Binsted said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like real astronauts, the Hi-Seas crew will be busy performing various scientific work, including excursions outside the dome in spacesuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to keep people in a can for eight months, you want to get as much science out of them as possible,'' Dr. Binsted said. ''It also means NASA gets a lot of bang for their buck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the science includes data Ms. Dunn will collect for her doctoral thesis. ''Not a lot of people get to shut out the world for eight months and work on their research,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first, there was the stop at <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dunn bought a pair of slippers. ''The ground level stays pretty cool,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilson picked up super glue and workout shorts. Dr. Binsted bought some supplemental food supplies -- hot sauce, powdered coconut milk and spinach wraps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, Ms. Lenio, the commander, was shopping for a ukulele.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll start a band,'' said Mr. Scheibelhut, who had brought his guitar.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDFour elegantly cloaked, well-shod gentlemen in idiosyncratic caps peer through what seems to be a porthole at distant Earth -- a planet so spiky with spires as to look machine-made. Their diverse headgear suggests differing national origins, with a turban wearer just visible to the far left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall tenor of the scene -- the brilliant sun above, a pale crescent moon below the terrestrial sphere -- suggests that these are the great astronomers of history, engaged in discussions about the design of the universe. They're positioned, however, on a weedy slope, which raises a question: Where are they, exactly?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture comes from a 15th-century French translation of the 1240 work ''De Proprietatibus Rerum'' (''On the Properties of Things''), by one Bartholomeus Anglicus, among the earliest forerunners of the modern encyclopedia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I came upon it while surfing through early books on the website of the National Library of France; the image was a low-resolution black-and-white scan, but even that view was revelatory: at once enigmatic and precise, a 600-year-old proto-science-fiction rendering of the cosmos. The image, by an anonymous artist, is one of about 300 in my new book, ''Cosmigraphics: Picturing Space Through Time,'' being published Tuesday by Abrams -- a survey of about 4,000 years of attempts to represent the universe in graphic form, whether in manuscripts, paintings, prints, books or broadsheets, all the way up to 21st-century supercomputer simulations of galaxy groups in flux and sunspots in bloom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A symbiotic relationship between representation and understanding is evident throughout, with the latter not necessarily preceding the former. Graphic images need not be mere illustrations of concepts described in texts or equations; they can be an important form of knowledge in their own right. In ''Laniakea Supercluster,'' for example, the astronomer R. Brent Tully uses a supercomputer to visualize gravitational flow lines knitting together an echoing expanse of space-time more than 500 million light-years in diameter. In this as in other pictures selected for the book, the image was the discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cosmigraphics'' begins at the beginning -- Day 1, creation, an address from which many visual depictions of the universe begin. Perhaps the most extraordinary set of pictures depicting space-time's origins dates from 1573. Discovered in the mid-20th century in an obscure notebook in the National Library of Spain, it was painted by the Portuguese artist and philosopher Francisco de Holanda, a student and lifelong friend of Michelangelo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his first image, a set of elongated triangles represents the holy trinity, with the Greek letters alpha and omega on top and ''Fiat Lux'' (''let there be light'') just below. Swathed in flames, they extend down into a kind of clay vessel. Although clearly positioned within representational art of a particularly mystical kind, de Holanda's triangular and circular forms seem simultaneously to anticipate early-20th-century abstraction -- for example, Kazimir Malevich's geometric Suprematist paintings. They're startlingly modern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second notebook page, by contrast, seems to predict another singular genius: William Blake, whom it predates by two centuries. Here the Creator, belted by stars, has assumed a material form. The previously opaque vessel below is now transparent, and centered on a single planet. It has become the multiple nested crystalline spheres that for more than 15 centuries were thought to carry the planets, the sun and the moon on their courses, with Earth at their nucleus. This cosmological design, several variations of which can be seen in ''Cosmigraphics,'' was first proposed by Aristotle, and later modified and expanded by Ptolemy in the second century A.D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, de Holanda depicts a geometry of turning forms set in motion by God's luminescent command. A giant sun pinions tiny Earth in a shadow-casting ray. While this work also vibrates with precursor elements to 20th-century avant-garde art, it contains an even more remarkable insight: Although the sun nominally rotates around Earth -- the old geocentric universe of Aristotle and Ptolemy -- in fact it dominates the picture, suggesting that the artist has subliminally grasped that it is the true center of our planetary system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The image is one of several medieval and Renaissance depictions of cosmic design that seem to exhibit a kind of precognitive intuition of what Nicolaus Copernicus proposed in 1543 -- the revolutionary notion of a heliocentric planetary system. (While de Holanda painted 30 years after Copernicus's death, heliocentrism didn't become accepted for at least another century, and it's unlikely the artist meant to advocate it, if he even knew of it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visual legacy encompassed by ''Cosmigraphics'' documents multiple stages of our evolving understanding as a species -- a gradually dawning, forever incomplete situational awareness about the cosmos and our place within it, rising across millenniums. The book's overarching subject is our emergence as conscious beings within an unimaginably vast and cryptic universe, one that doesn't necessarily guard its secrets willfully, but doesn't hand out codebooks either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the narrative threads woven into the book are the 18th-century visual meditations on the possible design of the Milky Way -- including the astonishing work of the undeservedly obscure English astronomer Thomas Wright, who in 1750 reasoned his way to (and illustrated) the flattened-disk form of our galaxy. In a book stuffed with exquisite mezzotint plates, Wright also conceived of another revolutionary concept: a multigalaxy cosmos. All of this a quarter-century before the American Revolution, at a time when the Milky Way was thought to constitute the entirety of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wright's vision was one seed from which our knowledge of billions of galaxies sprouted. ''Cosmigraphics'' traverses 16th- and 19th-century depictions of comets and eclipses, presents intensely colorful space-age planetary geological maps, and ultimately arrives at our contemporary understanding of space-time, in which whirling star-spirals glint all the way to the fading edge of the visible. But while the center doesn't hold in this vision, neither does anarchy: We're left with a spongiform universe of galaxy clusters foaming along weblike filaments of dark matter, which in turn extend between nodes of particularly bright high-mass concentrations. It all looks rather like a visualization of the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So where will it all end? ''Cosmigraphics'' concludes with a 14th-century vision of weightlessness. As with de Holanda's notebook, it was discovered only in the mid-20th century, when restorers removed plaster from the ceiling of one of the outstanding surviving churches of Byzantium, Chora Church in Istanbul. This fresco depicting a human figure (evidently wearing a supernatural kind of space helmet) has become known as ''The Angel of the Lord Rolling Up the Scroll of Heaven at the End of Time.''</p>

The plumes, sent up by the burning of the forest to clear land for cattle grazing, have grown so vast this year that astronauts have photographed them from the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the podium at the United Nations to declarations on the campaign trail, President Dilma Rousseff is celebrating Brazil's protection of the Amazon. But satellite data released last month shows that Brazil's annual deforestation rate in the Amazon has climbed again after years of declines, rising 29 percent, leaving her vulnerable to attacks in this nation's acrimonious presidential race. The vote is on Sunday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mantra in Brasília is that they have deforestation under control, but the evidence on the ground shows this is not true,'' said Philip M. Fearnside, a prominent researcher at the National Institute for Amazon Research in Manaus, the Amazon's largest city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond alarming scientists, who note the importance of the vast rain forest to the world's climate and biodiversity, the sparring over the Amazon symbolizes clashing visions of Brazil's future. Both Ms. Rousseff and her top rival, Marina Silva, an environmental leader, say they want forest conservation, but the president's model seeks economic growth by tapping into the Amazon's natural resources, including huge mining projects and dams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Silva -- the daughter of rubber tappers, raised in the far reaches of the rain forest -- wants to shift toward energy sources viewed as having less of an impact on the environment. With the Amazon gaining importance as a strategic pillar of Brazil's economy -- which is the largest in Latin America -- the jump in deforestation has each candidate lashing out at the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rousseff is heralding what she calls her achievements in the Amazon, like building Belo Monte, one of the world's largest hydroelectric dams, and bringing down the high levels of deforestation of the past. Ms. Rousseff has emphasized the jobs her projects have created in the Amazon, helping her regain the lead in opinion polls against Ms. Silva.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to know where the setbacks have been,'' Ms. Rousseff said in one caustic remark directed at Ms. Silva in their exchanges over deforestation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Silva, a former environment minister, contends that Ms. Rousseff's policies are responsible for the increase in deforestation and an erosion of Brazil's international standing on environmental issues, pointing to the stalled creation of new conservation areas and Brazil's refusal to sign a <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> declaration seeking to end deforestation entirely by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Deforestation is rising again because of incompetence, inefficiency and a lack of commitment in protecting the Amazon,'' said Ms. Silva. After surging in the opinion polls in September, she has tried to dispel criticism over policies that some voters see as threatening to large-scale agriculture in the Amazon and other regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges of balancing conservation and economic development in the world's largest remaining area of tropical forest come into sharp relief here in the turbulent region around Novo Progresso, a remote settlement of gold miners, cattle ranchers and loggers on the BR-163, a highway cutting across the Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Ms. Silva broke from the governing Workers Party in 2009, she oversaw a plan to bolster conservation along the road, which runs more than 1,000 miles and connects the agricultural heartland of Mato Grosso to the port of Santarém. Under the project, the road was to be paved, easing the way for commodities like soybeans to be exported to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both forest protection and the asphalting of the highway remain elusive goals. In Pará, a state almost twice the size of Texas, long stretches are still unpaved, producing a bone-rattling ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it rains, the BR-163 loses much of its resemblance to a road. Stalled trucks spin their wheels in the mud. Pickups try to avoid careering into potholes the size of kiddie pools. At some points, drivers simply arrange their vehicles in a remarkably orderly line and wait for the mud to dry, a process that can last a day or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This place is like a little bit of hell,'' said Eduardo Pimentel, 43, a truck driver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around Novo Progresso, a cat-and-mouse game also plays out each day between land speculators and the environmental police, who fan out by helicopter over colossal stretches of public land to detect signs of fires and illegal logging, gold prospecting and cattle ranching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crackdown by armed agents of Brazil's <span class="companylink">environmental protection agency</span>, who have received so many threats here that they require the protection of other elite police units, is part of Brazil's efforts to assert control over this disorderly frontier and combat illegal deforestation, a leading cause of global carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes are huge. Agriculture continues to expand in the Amazon, while authorities are pursuing a new array of huge dams, raising tension across the immense hinterland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the security forces here find new signs of illegal deforestation, they often act swiftly, arresting and fining those responsible. They destroy encampments and equipment, setting fire to tractors and logging trucks. Such methods helped lower annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by about 70 percent since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But land speculators are adapting. Investigators say that some have assembled a web of informants tracking the movements of the environmental police. At times, small revolts have also erupted, as when dozens of people in a nearby settlement cornered the environmental police at their hotel in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are tactics like deploying arsonist crews at times of heavy cloud cover or light rains, when detecting fires under the forest canopy by satellite is thought to be harder. Some have even set the forest alight by tossing Molotov cocktails from small planes, said Luciano de Meneses Evaristo, a top official at Brazil's <span class="companylink">environmental protection agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the Wild West of environmental crimes,'' he said. ''We are waging an endless war.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. de Meneses Evaristo and other Brazilian officials say that measures taken over the last decade, like creating new national forests and blocking public loans to landowners who violate environmental regulations, have helped push the deforestation rate to historic lows, despite the recent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No country has done more than Brazil to fight illegal deforestation,'' said Izabella Teixeira, Brazil's environment minister, pointing out that Brazilian law allows for certain amounts of legal deforestation, preventing the country from signing the United Nations agreement seeking to end deforestation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though almost 20 percent of the Brazilian Amazon has been cleared since the 1960s and '70s, Ms. Teixeira said that Brazil could serve as an anti-deforestation example for the developing world. ''I would love for the forests of Indonesia or the Congo River Basin to have the same levels of protection we have forged,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Brazil's deforestation rate could climb for a second consecutive year, after the 29 percent increase from 2012 to 2013. Preliminary data from a satellite-based system showed a 9 percent increase in deforestation alerts, the National Institute for Space Research said in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Views differ on whether the alerts reflect another expansion of illegal deforestation, the legal burning of forest on private lands or fires set on previously cleared cattle pastures. Ms. Teixeira said she expected the overall deforestation rate to remain flat in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others disagree. Adalberto Veríssimo, a researcher at Imazon, a Brazilian institute that uses satellite imagery to track deforestation, said he expected the deforestation rate to climb about 5 percent from 2013 to 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're witnessing an increase in speculative deforestation and forest destruction for the government's own infrastructure projects,'' Mr. Veríssimo said. ''There's been a rearrangement of priorities, with the Amazon targeted for massive investments. Naturally this opens the way for new deforestation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Pará, a plan to build a complex of new dams around a tributary of the Amazon River is projected to increase forest loss. New roads are also expected to lure thousands of settlers, pressuring forest resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the BR-163, violent land-grabs persist as speculators eye tracts for grazing cattle and logging. Near the town of Trairão, Osvalinda Marcelino Alves Pereira, 45, recently registered death threats from loggers who accused her of being an informant for the environmental police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They told me I'd be killed like Dorothy,'' said Ms. Alves Pereira, a settler who grows crops like manioc, referring to Dorothy Stang, the American nun and rain forest activist who was shot dead in Pará in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the deforestation hot spot of Novo Progresso, residents openly chafe at the environmental police and other federal officials. ''Global warming is a lie concocted by interests in rich countries which covet Amazonia,'' said Agamenon da Silva Menezes, 63, a cattle rancher and business leader who arrived here in 1985, opening a supply depot for gold prospectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hostility against the authorities simmers here after federal investigators in August arrested members of what they described as one of the Amazon's largest land-grabbing gangs. The organization rapidly deforested lands around Novo Progresso before flipping them to buyers by using shell companies, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't regret deforesting land,'' Ezequiel Castanha, a leader of the organization, who remains at large, defiantly told journalists before the arrests. ''If it weren't for deforestation, Brazil would not exist.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ebullient Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on hand at the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span>'s command center in Bangalore for the early-morning event and hailed it ''as a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The odds were stacked against us,'' Mr. Modi, wearing a red Nehru vest, said in a televised news conference. ''When you are trying to do something that has not been attempted before, it is a leap into the unknown. And space is indeed the biggest unknown out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children across India were asked to arrive at school by 6:45 a.m. Wednesday, well before the usual starting time, to watch the historic event on state television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Orbiter Mission, or MOM, was intended mostly to prove that India could succeed in such a highly technical endeavor -- and to beat China. As Mr. Modi and others have noted, India's trip to Mars, at a price of $74 million, cost less than ''Gravity,'' the Hollywood movie. NASA's almost simultaneous -- and far more complex -- mission to Mars cost $671 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Success was by no means assured. Of the 51 attempts to reach Mars, only 21 have succeeded, and none on any country's first try, Mr. Modi noted. Japan failed, in 1999, and China in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Modi, who was elected in May with a once-in-a-generation majority in <span class="companylink">Parliament</span>, has been on something of a roll. And the Mars achievement, which he had almost nothing to do with, will only add to that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Modi leaves Friday for New York, where he will address the <span class="companylink">United Nations General Assembly</span> as well as a sold-out, largely Indian-American crowd at Madison Square Garden before heading to Washington for a meeting with President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span> has always had a small budget, and for years it worked in international isolation after many countries cut off technological sharing programs after Indian nuclear tests. It has launched more than 50 satellites since 1975, including five foreign satellites in one June launch. As other countries have rethought their pricey space programs, India's low-budget affair has gained increasing attention and orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its success has been seen as a fulfillment of the kind of state-sponsored self-sufficiency that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru cherished but that, in the main, left India impoverished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, India's technological isolation in defense and other areas has been due in large part to the country's restrictions on foreign investments and its poor infrastructure. India is now the world's largest importer of arms because of its inability to make its own and its refusal to let foreign companies open plants owned entirely by them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's most important export is the cheap brainpower of its engineers, based in technology centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad, who provide software and back-office operations for corporations around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our success on Mars is a crucial marketing opportunity for low-cost technological know-how, which is what we do really well,'' said C. Uday Bhaskar, an analyst with the Society for Policy Studies, a New Delhi research center. India's space program ''spent peanuts, and they got it done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's decision to launch Mangalyaan, the name of its spacecraft, came after China's own mission to Mars failed in 2012. In almost every sphere, the Chinese have outpaced the Indians over the last three decades, but Indian scientists saw an opportunity to beat them to Mars.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDStardust got in their eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring a group of astronomers who go by the name of Bicep announced that they had detected ripples in the sky, gravitational waves that were the opening notes of the Big Bang. The finding was heralded as potentially the greatest discovery of the admittedly young century, but some outside astronomers said the group had underestimated the extent to which interstellar dust could have contaminated the results -- a possibility that the group conceded in its official report in June.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a long-awaited report by astronomers using data from the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Planck satellite has confirmed that criticism, concluding that there was enough dust in Bicep's view of the sky to produce the swirly patterns without recourse to primordial gravitational waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no 'clean' windows in the sky,'' the Planck collaboration, led by Jean-Loup Puget of the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France, wrote in a paper submitted to the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and posted online Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, cosmologists like the Bicep crew cannot ignore dust in their calculations. ''However,'' said Jonathan Aumont, another of the Planck authors, also from the Orsay institute, ''our work does not imply that they did not measure at all a cosmological signal. Moreover, due to the very different observation techniques and signal processing in the Bicep2 and Planck experiments, we cannot say how much of the signal they measured is due to dust'' and how much to gravitational waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this is not the end of the story, both the Planck scientists and the Bicep group agree. But the original euphoria that the secrets of inflation and quantum gravity might be at hand has evaporated. Planck and Bicep are now collaborating on a detailed comparison of their results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Kovac of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, lead author of the Bicep paper, said the new report confirmed in greater detail the trend suggested by the first Planck papers in the spring, which indicated there is more dust even in the cleanest parts of the galaxy than anyone had thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raphael Flauger of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J., who first raised the issue of dust in the Bicep report, said it confirmed what he had thought. ''It doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room,'' he wrote in an email, ''and it seems clear that at least the majority of the signal is caused by dust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravitational waves may exist, although they would be weaker than the Bicep analysis indicated, causing theorists to reshuffle their ideas. As Richard Bond, an early universe expert at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> and a Planck team member, put it: ''Planck showed that dust could possibly be the entire Bicep2 signal, but Planck alone cannot decide. We have to do this in combination with Bicep2.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joint comparison and Planck's own polarization maps are due at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If true, Bicep's detection of gravitational waves would confirm a theory that the universe began with a violent outward antigravitational swoosh known as inflation, the mainspring of Big Bang theorizing for the last three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disagreement over the Bicep finding will not mean the end of inflation theory; it just means it will be harder for cosmologists to find out how it worked. The Bicep group and an alphabet soup of competitors are soldiering on with new telescopes and experiments aimed at peeling away the secrets of the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael S. Turner, a cosmologist at the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>, said: ''This is going to be a long march, but the goal of probing the earliest moments of the universe makes it well worth the effort. Dust is the bane of the existence of astrophysicists -- and cosmologists. It is everywhere, and yet our understanding of it is very poor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are less optimistic. Paul J. Steinhardt of <span class="companylink">Princeton University</span>, a critic of the Bicep paper -- and of inflation theory -- said in an email that the Bicep paper should be retracted, ''and we should return to good scientific practice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bicep observations are the deepest look yet into a thin haze of microwaves, known as cosmic background radiation, left over from end of the Big Bang, when the cosmos was about 380,000 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to theory, the onset of inflation, less than a trillionth of a second after time began, should have left ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves. They would manifest as corkscrew patterns in the direction of polarization of the cosmic microwaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bicep group -- its name is an acronym for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization -- is led by Dr. Kovac; Jamie Bock of Caltech; Clement Pryke of the <span class="companylink">University of Minnesota</span>; and Chao-Lin Kuo of <span class="companylink">Stanford</span>. They have deployed a series of radio telescopes at the South Pole in search of the swirl pattern. Their most recent, Bicep2, detected a signal in the sweet spot for some of the most popular models of inflation, leading to a splashy news conference and a summer of controversy and gossip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the critics pointed out, things besides quantum ripples from the beginning of time could produce those swirls, including light from interstellar dust polarized by magnetic fields in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planck, launched in 2008 to survey the cosmic microwave sky, can distinguish the characteristic signature of dust by comparing the sky brightness in several radio frequencies, as well as measuring its direction of polarization. Bicep2, in contrast, looked at only one frequency, 150 gigahertz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bicep astronomers asked for Planck data on their patch of sky, but it was not available until now because of suspected instrument problems, Dr. Aumont said. So they extrapolated from existing data to conclude that there was little dust interfering with their observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Planck report has knocked the pins out from under that. But there are still large uncertainties that leave room for primordial gravitational waves at some level. For example, the Planck team had to extrapolate some of its own measurements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Planck report says, ''This result emphasizes the need for a dedicated joint Planck-Bicep2 analysis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group hopes this analysis will include data from the latest Bicep telescope, called the Keck Array, which has been gathering data for several months. In an interview this summer, Dr. Kovac said, ''It's been a funny year to be in the spotlight like this.'' He said the group stood behind its work, even if the ultimate interpretation of the measurements is up for grabs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging that dust would not be as sexy a discovery as ripples from inflation, Dr. Kovac said, ''It's really important as an experimentalist that you can divorce yourself from an investment in what the answer is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on: ''One thing that would distress me bitterly is if a major mistake in the measurement or of the analysis would come to light. The most pressing question is, what are the dust contributions to the signal?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay tuned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lyman Page, an astrophysicist at Princeton, said the episode illustrated the messy progress of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Taking a step back,'' he said by email, ''it is amazing that a precise measurement of the cosmos can be made, discussed in fullness, and refuted by another measurement in such a short amount of time. It is testament to a healthy field.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 30, 2014, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about a new report claiming that dust had interfered with observations of microwave radiation left over from the Big Bang misstated the affiliation of two of the authors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the spacecraft fired its engines for 34 minutes 26 seconds, mission controllers received acknowledgment at about 10:25 p.m. Eastern time that Maven was in orbit around Mars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things look really great with the orbit at this point,'' David F. Mitchell, the project manager, said at a news conference afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft is healthy and currently in a big, looping 35-hour orbit around Mars, the managers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And now we get to do the science that we've been planning for all this time,'' said Bruce M. Jakosky, the mission's principal investigator, who came up with the concept for Maven 11 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission team will spend six weeks turning on and checking systems on Maven -- the name is short for Martian Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution -- and moving it to its final 4.5-hour orbit before beginning its science measurements in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first, it will have a sideshow, taking observations of a comet that, by rare happenstance, will make a close flyby of Mars on Oct. 19, passing within 82,000 miles. Mission managers have arranged to activate Maven's eight scientific sensors by then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft is to spend five days observing how the comet's dust, traveling at 125,000 miles per hour, might heat up and expand Mars' atmosphere, and how water ice from the comet might bump up the levels of hydrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a precaution, Maven will be on the other side of Mars, using it as a shield, when the shower of comet dust is heaviest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Dr. Jakosky, a professor of geological sciences at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span>, will turn his attention to the coming science measurements. Planetary scientists believe that about four billion years ago, the young Mars was blanketed with a thick layer of air -- heat-trapping carbon dioxide, in particular -- that kept it warmer and wetter than it is today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometime since then, the air thinned, leaving the surface dry and cold. The air molecules could have escaped to space or been transformed by chemical reactions into rock. Maven's eight instruments will take stock of Mars' upper atmosphere and catalog the solar wind particles bombarding the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will allow the scientists to determine not only the rate at which the atmosphere is disappearing, but also how it is disappearing. The first science results are expected by the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maven is not the only new visitor to Mars. India's Mars Orbiter Mission, or MOM, is to swing into orbit on Tuesday night Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three other orbiters are currently around Mars -- NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Mars Express spacecraft.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space race is shaping up as a matchup of billionaires, with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, facing off against Elon Musk, the founder of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Tesla, over the future of human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin, a private space company owned by Mr. Bezos, said on Wednesday that it had agreed to work with a joint venture run by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> to build new engines for their Atlas 5 rockets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That venture, called <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, has sent nearly all United States spy and military satellites into space in the last decade, but a rise in tensions with Russia this year after its annexation of Crimea has forced the venture to look for a replacement. In May, Russia threatened to stop delivering the engines, known as RD-180s, in response to American sanctions against top Russian officials, though there has been no evidence yet that it will follow through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that Blue Origin would assume a bigger role in space launches came as NASA on Tuesday announced it had picked <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and replace the retired space shuttle program. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> plans to use Atlas 5 rockets for its manned spacecraft, while <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will use its existing rocket, the Falcon 9, to propel its new capsule. The first flights could take place as early as 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By working with Blue Origin to build new American-made engines, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed</span> sidestep the politically sensitive issue of the Russian RD-180 engines on the Atlas 5 for NASA and military missions in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also throws Mr. Bezos directly into the contentious battle that Mr. Musk has been waging to force <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> into the business of launching military satellites. In April, Mr. Musk sued the <span class="companylink">Air Force</span> to reverse an $11 billion contract awarded to U.L.A. to launch about 35 satellites over five years, citing the hazard of using Russian engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move angered <span class="companylink">Air Force</span> officials who have been working to certify <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for future launches and are eager to introduce competition into the business to reduce launch costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that the Atlas 5 rocket will eventually be using American engines made by Mr. Bezos's company is likely to be welcomed by the <span class="companylink">Air Force</span> and congressional leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.L.A. started using the Russian RD-180 engines for the Atlas 5 rockets since the 1990s as part of a deal reached after the end of the Cold War to improve technological cooperation with Russia. The engines have proved to be extraordinarily reliable as well as cheaper than anything available in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.L.A. also uses another rocket, the Delta 4, whose engines are made in the United States. It has launched more than 80 satellites for defense and spy agencies with perfect success record in the last decade. U.L.A. has said it had enough RD-180 engines on hand to last for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The team at Blue Origin is methodically developing technologies to enable human access to space at dramatically lower cost and increased reliability,'' Mr. Bezos said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Origin and U.L.A. said they planned to build the new engine in four years and begin full-scale testing in 2016 with first flights in 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The awards reflect a fundamental shift in NASA's human spaceflight program, relying on private companies rather than the traditional hands-on approach, in which the space agency designed and operated the spacecraft.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first flights could take off as soon as 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have credible plans for both companies to get there by that period of time,'' Kathryn Lueders, the manager for NASA's commercial crew program, said during a news conference on Tuesday. ''We will not sacrifice crew safety for that goal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> received a $4.2 billion contract. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span> -- better known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, of Hawthorne, Calif. -- received a $2.6 billion contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today we're one step closer to launching our astronauts from U.S. soil on American spacecraft and ending the nation's sole reliance on Russia,'' said Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011, NASA has had no way to send its astronauts into orbit, relying on the venerable Russian Soyuz spacecraft for transportation to and from the International Space Station at a cost of $70 million per seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That became a politically uncomfortable arrangement after Russia's annexation of Crimea and support of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mulholland, commercial crew manager at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, said NASA had called just before the news conference to tell him his company had won the competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the contracts, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will finish development of their spacecraft. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s CST-100 capsule, configured to carry up to five people, will launch on an Atlas 5 rocket. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Dragon 2 capsule, a sleeker, updated version of the capsule already carrying cargo to the space station, will ride on top of the company's Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bids from the two companies covered the same tasks. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s proposal was more expensive, in part because the Atlas 5 is more expensive than the Falcon 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third company, Sierra Nevada Space Systems, of Louisville, Colo., had proposed a design that resembled a mini-space shuttle that would land on aircraft runways. A statement from the company said it would review its options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the money allotted to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> in the next three years will go to meeting NASA's certification requirements for performance and safety. As part of that process, each company will conduct a test flight to the space station with a crew that is to include at least one NASA astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the companies are certified, NASA has promised each at least two missions. The full contract amounts will be paid if NASA orders six missions from each company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mulholland said NASA had yet to discuss its plans in detail, but space agency officials in the past have said they expected two flights a year to the space station. If flights begin in 2017 and each company flies one a year, the contracts could run through 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each flight taking four astronauts, the space station crew will be able to grow to seven, from six. NASA officials said that additional crew member would allow the agency to double the amount of science conducted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> capsules will also serve as lifeboats for the space station crew in case of an emergency. The commercial crew program came out of the cancellation of an earlier program started under the Bush administration to send astronauts back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That effort relied on two rockets designed and operated by NASA. The Obama administration concluded that approach was too expensive and canceled the rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the administration built on another Bush-era initiative. NASA had hired two companies, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Vienna, Va., to fly cargo to the space station. Beginning in 2010, NASA began a similar competition to choose companies to carry astronauts, not just cargo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that the commercial approach will spur a space travel industry far larger than just NASA. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, for example, hopes that the fifth seat in its CST-100 capsule could carry a paying tourist to the space station. ''We'll be working with NASA to try and bring that to reality,'' Mr. Mulholland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> are working with <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span>, a Las Vegas company that plans to launch private space stations into orbit, to be leased to nations or companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to be aggressive to cultivate the business beyond NASA,'' said John Elbon, vice president and general manager for space exploration at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two years of Mars enthusiasts asking, ''Are we there yet?'' the mission managers for NASA's Curiosity rover can finally yell back, ''Yes, we're there!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Curiosity rover has reached the destination where it will begin its main science investigations, the base of a three-mile-high mountain that the science team has named Mount Sharp. As the rover makes it way up the mountain, it will cross layers of rock that contain clues to the early geological and environmental history of Mars when it was warmer and wetter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are here to tell everyone that the next phase of research on Mars for Curiosity can now begin,'' James L. Green, the director of NASA's planetary science division, said during a telephone news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover landed in August 2012 within the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater after an eight-month cruise from earth. John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist for the mission, characterized the drive of the past two years as a second cruise phase. ''The science is all in front of us,'' he said. ''But for this moment, we should be celebrating the engineering accomplishments of this mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity did conduct some science measurements soon after it landed, fulfilling one of its central objectives: showing that the crater was once an ancient lake that could have been habitable for microbes, if any microbes existed. Now, the scientists are hoping to find carbon-based compounds preserved within the rocks that could have served as the building blocks for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip to Mount Sharp has taken longer than expected, partly because of the diversion for scientific measurements and because Curiosity needs to be driven with some care, to avoid sharp rocks of the kind that have damaged its wheels and soft sand dunes that might ensnare it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, and Dr. Grotzinger in particular, came under criticism during a review for its proposal for two years of additional financing beyond its original two-year span. The review panel, composed of outside experts hired by NASA, ranked it the lowest of the seven NASA proposals it looked at. Though the panel ultimately voted to extend Curiosity's mission, its members expressed concern that the mission was underperforming for its $2.5 billion price tag and that the mission team was putting too much emphasis on driving and not enough on conducting scientific research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green focused on the panel's overall positive conclusion -- that all of the extended missions were cost-effective and productive -- and played down the negatives. ''To me, the top recommendation is how important these missions are as we move forward,'' he said. For the 2015 fiscal year, the Curiosity mission will cost $59.4 million to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger also presented the results of the rover's most recent attempt at drilling a rock that the scientists call Bonanza King, which after being dusted off was found to be a gray-green color, rather than the usual Mars red. The effort failed, because the rock proved to be not safe to drill. ''The rock started to move,'' he said. ''It jumped around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other instruments found the rock to have a high silicon content, which Dr. Grotzinger said was an indication that it had been altered by water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover is now headed to an outcrop called Pahrump Hills at the base of Mount Sharp and should arrive in a week or two. There, the mission scientists expect to find a suitable rock to drill.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the moon wheels around Earth every 28 days and shows us a progressively greater and then stingier slice of its sun-lightened face, the distance between moon and Earth changes, too. At the nearest point along its egg-shaped orbit, its perigee, the moon may be 26,000 miles closer to us than it is at its far point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And should the moon happen to hit its ever-shifting orbital perigee at the same time that it lies athwart from the sun, we are treated to a so-called supermoon, a full moon that can seem embraceably close -- as much as 12 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than the average full moon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the weather is good where you are, please, go out Tuesday night and gawk for yourself: A supermoon will be dominating the sky. It's the last of this summer's impressive run of three supermoons, and the final one of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers dislike the whole supermoon hoopla. They point out that the term originated with astrology, not astronomy; that perigee full moons are not all that rare, coming an average of every 13 ½ months; and that their apparently swollen dimensions are often as much a matter of optical illusion and wishful blinking as of relative lunar nearness. The superstar astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson grumbled archly on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> that the ''perennially hyped'' term debases the legacy of Superman, supernovas and the video game character Super Mario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, astronomers concur that whatever the reason, yes, you should look at the moon early and often, whether it's waxing or waning, gibbous or crescent, and appreciate the many features that set our moon apart from the other 100-plus moons of the solar system, and even celebrate our loyal satellite as a planet in its own right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know it goes contrary to the nomenclature currently used,'' said David A. Paige, a professor of planetary science at the University of California, Los Angeles, referring to the definition of a planet as the dominant gravitational object in its orbit. ''But where I come from, anything that's big enough to be round is a planet.'' Unlike most moons of the solar system, ours has the heft to pull itself into a sphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sparks of Discovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say that while the public may think of the moon as a problem solved and a bit retro -- the place astronauts visited a half-dozen times way back before Watergate and then abandoned with a giant ''meh'' from mankind -- in fact, lunar studies is a vibrant enterprise that is yielding a wealth of insights and surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One research group reported new evidence that the moon was born violently, in an act of planetary suicide that left faint but readable fingerprints. Another team proposed that the moon's cataclysmic origins could explain the mysterious lunar features we know as the man in the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly on the basis of data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a multi-instrument spacecraft that has been orbiting, mapping and analyzing the moon since 2009, researchers have found that the moon is a place of thermal lunacy, of searing heat crossed with sub-Plutonic cold, and of pockets that may be the most frigid spots in the entire solar system. Recent measurements taken inside impact craters at the lunar poles, where no solar light is thought to have penetrated for a billion years or more, showed temperatures of about 30 degrees Celsius above absolute zero, Dr. Paige said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Jordan of the <span class="companylink">University of New Hampshire</span> and his colleagues have calculated that these temperature extremes could give rise to a novel form of sparkiness, tiny bolts of lightning that dance silently through the moon's airless landscape and fluff up the soil as they flash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporting in The Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, the researchers proposed that charged particles from the sun could be getting trapped at slightly different depths of the frigid lunar surface, forming electric fields. Those fields would gradually build up strength until, zap, serious sparks start to fly, which in turn would vaporize particles of soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sparking events, the researchers said, could explain the foamy appearance of soil recently detected by NASA's orbiter. The lunar surface ''may be far more active than we thought,'' Dr. Jordan said. ''It's amazing to have this kind of natural laboratory almost in our spatial backyard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an average distance of 238,855 miles, the moon is indeed on Earth's patio: string together just 11 round trips from New York to Tasmania, and you're there. The moon is not the largest satellite in the solar system -- three moons of Jupiter and one of Saturn are bigger -- but with a diameter almost 30 percent of Earth's, it is by far the largest relative to its planet. Jupiter's Ganymede, for example, which tops the lunar size chart, measures just 4 percent the diameter of its gas-giant sponsor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Violent Birth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another outstanding feature of the moon is its origin. Most of the other moons in the solar system are thought to be celestial passers-by that were pulled into a planet's orbit, or to have formed contemporaneously with their planet from an initial starter disc of dust, gas and rock. The moon, by contrast, is thought to have a bloodier past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the reigning hypothesis, about 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after Earth had accreted down into a sphere from its little slub of circumsolar material, another newborn planet, still shaky on its feet, slammed obliquely into Earth with terrifying force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ''giant impactor,'' Theia, who in Greek mythology was mother to the goddess of the moon, is thought to have been roughly the size of Mars and to have been pulverized in the encounter, along with a good chunk of proto-Earth. From that fiery cloud of all-Theia and part-Earth, the scenario goes, our moon soon condensed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impactor hypothesis made sense and comported with computer models, but hard evidence for it proved elusive. If the moon was partly the offspring of a non-Earth body -- Theia -- there should be chemical fingerprints attesting to the foreign parentage. Astronomers who have analyzed a wide array of extraterrestrial material have determined that the many residents of the solar system differ measurably in their isotope ratios, the forms of the chemical elements they carry. (Heavy oxygen or light? Titanium with more neutrons or fewer?) But when researchers checked the isotope content in rocks from the moon, the ratios looked identical to rocks on Earth. Where were the traces of Theia?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it looks as if the evidence has arrived. This summer, Daniel Herwartz, a geochemist working at the University of Göttingen in Germany and his colleagues reported in the journal Science that they had detected isotopic ratios of oxygen in lunar rocks that were unlike the forms of oxygen found on Earth. It is, Dr. Herwartz said, ''the difference between Earth and moon predicted by the impact theory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers stumbled to victory accidentally, he said. As geochemists, they had developed new techniques for more precisely measuring oxygen isotopes to address Earth-based geological problems. ''When that succeeded,'' Dr. Herwartz said, ''we thought we'd have a look at the moon question again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial efforts foundered. ''NASA doesn't hand out Apollo samples to everybody,'' he said, referring to rocks brought back decades ago by astronauts. So the scientists tried to work with meteorite fragments, which proved too disturbed to be useful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They then persuaded the space agency to hand over a baby aspirin's worth of pure Apollo rock, and, sure enough, there was Theia's isotopic thumbprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerging From the Darkness</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signs of the fiery collision may linger in the moon's familiar patchwork of dark and light splotches that has long been likened, dubiously, to a man's face. It's the only side of the moon we ever see from home base, a result of Earth's having yanked its satellite into a so-called tidal lock: The time it takes the moon to rotate once on its axis is the same as the four weeks it takes to orbit Earth, which means the same side is always turned toward us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the minimum energy configuration, the most stable configuration the two can take,'' said Arpita Roy, a doctoral student in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State who is also an author of a new report in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the dawn of the space age, when astronomers glimpsed the first photographs of the far side of the moon, they've wondered why it differed visibly from the near side, particularly in its absence of the dark flat plains called maria, from the Latin for seas. In the new paper, the researchers applied insights from the study of exoplanets that circle close to their stars and, like the moon, are tidally locked, with one half facing ever sunward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the immediate aftermath of the giant impact, Ms. Roy said, the Earth would have been as hot as a small sun, which means the half of the moon that faced us would have remained hot as well, while the opposite side had a chance to cool down. Some metals and silicates from the dust cloud surrounding the young orb would preferentially settle onto the cool side, thickening that portion of the crust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, future meteor impacts on the far side would fail to puncture below the crust, while those hitting the thin-crusted near side would expose the moon's soft inner layers. ''The craters would fill with the gooey stuff underneath,'' Ms. Roy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That goo then hardened into maria, the seas we see when we have the good sense to look up and lock eyes with the moon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, ''all extended missions were rated higher than 'good,' some after adjustments to scope, as it was recognized that they continue to add important new data and observations for our understanding of solar system bodies and processes,'' the review panel concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of NASA's planetary program seemed happy. ''I think fundamentally we were excited that every mission was given the go-ahead to go on,'' said Casey Dreier, the director of advocacy at the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>, a nonprofit organization that promotes space exploration. ''I think that was the biggest takeaway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the financial calculus for the review appeared more complex than usual, because Curiosity ended its two-year primary mission in June. Its costs now come out of the budget set aside for extended missions, and that led to speculation that agency officials might turn off Cassini to fit within fiscal constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has proposed deep cuts to the planetary science portion of NASA the last few years, and Congress has partly restored the cuts each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extensions, which would cost $200 million a year, or about 15 percent of NASA's planetary science budget, still hinge on whether enough money is available. Congress has yet to pass a budget for fiscal year 2015, which begins next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we do not end up with sufficient funds, NASA will revisit the senior review findings and make the necessary programmatic decisions across our portfolio,'' said William P. Knopf, the lead program executive for mission operations in the planetary science division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology will hold a hearing about the planetary science program Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini, which has been in orbit around Saturn for a decade, was the only mission to receive an ''excellent'' rating from the panel. It was also the only mission to receive a three-year extension, long enough to conduct all of the planned science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And best of all, we know now we will live out the full promise of one extraordinary mission,'' Carolyn C. Porco, the head of Cassini's imaging team, wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. ''Happy tears in the eyes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, fuel for the maneuvering thrusters will run out, and the spacecraft will be sent on a dive into Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In giving a ''very good/good'' grade to the extension proposal for the $2.5 billion Curiosity mission, the panel was especially displeased that John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist, did not present the extension proposal in person, leaving it to a deputy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This left the panel with the impression that the team felt they were too big to fail and that simply having someone show up would suffice,'' the panel wrote. Dr. Grotzinger said in an interview that he had been scheduled to give a talk about Mars on the day the panel met, and, after consulting with NASA officials, decided not to cancel the talk. ''I like to honor my existing professional commitments, especially when they involve outreach,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the team was making the requested revisions. ''The review panel was asking us to do more drilling and less driving, and we're going to do that,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity, by coincidence, has just arrived at the destination to begin its main scientific investigation, the base of a three-mile-high mountain in the middle of Gale Crater. By examining the layers of rock as it drives up the mountain, planetary scientists hope to extract the climate history of early Mars when it was warmer and wetter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Curiosity team will hold a news conference on Thursday to present its latest findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ranking above Curiosity was the older Opportunity rover, which received an ''excellent/very good'' rating, allowing it to continue driving to a large deposit of clays. Clay minerals form in aqueous environments that are not acidic, promising sites that could have once been hospitable to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity rover just had its memory erased and reformatted last Thursday, eliminating the 0.7 percent that had gone bad over the past decade. The rover has had several computer glitches in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other missions under review were the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Odyssey orbiter and the Mars Express orbiter. (Mars Express is a <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> spacecraft, but NASA helps operate two of the of the instruments.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next two years will be busy for NASA's robotic probes. A new spacecraft, Maven, will arrive at Mars this month to look for clues why Mars long ago dried out and turned cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next July, the New Horizons spacecraft will zip past Pluto for the first close-up look at it; in 2016, another spacecraft, Juno, will arrive at Jupiter to study its interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 2017, however, the pipeline slows. An ambitious mission to study Europa, a moon of Jupiter with an ocean beneath its outer layer of ice and signs of plate tectonics, is not expected to launch until the 2020s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Dreier, of the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>, said he was optimistic. ''We've stemmed the bleeding and we're making a strong case for why planetary is important,'' he said. ''It's one of the few parts of NASA that really does explore.''</p>

With a single click online, he paid $100,000, about a third of his annual income, for a seat on a rocket that will carry him into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Come 2016, if all goes as planned, Mr. Sheng, 41, a tea trader from the southeastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, will spend up to six minutes floating 64 miles above the Earth as one of the first civilians aboard a commercially operated flight beyond the planet's atmosphere.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've always wanted to go into space,'' he said recently, recalling that he got hooked on space films and science fiction as a boy growing up in a mountain village. ''I've always wondered if Armstrong did actually walk on the moon. I'd like to have a look myself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A half-century ago, bemoaning his nation's backwardness, Mao Zedong said that China could not launch a potato into space. Now, well-to-do Chinese business people are lining up for one-hour voyages to the cosmos, and tour operators say China is set to become the world's largest market for the incipient space tourism industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, more than 30 mainland Chinese have purchased or made down payments of 50 percent on tickets for journeys offered by <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>, a company based in Mojave, Calif., that plans to begin operating suborbital flights late next year. The tours went on sale in China in December, two years after the company began selling them elsewhere, and one in 10 of all bookings have been by Chinese citizens, according to Dexo Travel, the Beijing-based sales agent in China for the trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales reflect late-blooming interest in space travel in China, which celebrated the successful landing of a lunar rover in December, four decades after the United States accomplished the same feat. The notion of traveling amid the stars has captivated a segment of the Chinese public just as it once fascinated Americans who were riveted by Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon. But unlike that earlier generation, the Chinese have the option of booking a trip themselves -- and many have the money to pay for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are wealthy people everywhere in the world, but there are not so many wealthy people who also dream of going into space,'' said Alex Tang, chief executive of XCOR Aerospace's Asia operation. China, he said, had both. In a survey this year of more than 200 Chinese luxury travelers by the Shanghai-based research firm Hurun, about 7 percent said they hoped to visit space within the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tang attributed the Chinese passion for space travel to the recent successes of the nation's space program. ''Many want to go to space like Yang Liwei,'' he said, referring to the astronaut who circled the Earth in 2003 and came home a national hero for bringing China into the ranks of space-faring nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhang Yong, chief executive of Dexo Travel, described the people booking seats as business executives and entrepreneurs who already have luxury homes and cars and are turning their sights beyond earthly objects. Two-thirds are male, he said. Influenced by books and films like ''Gravity,'' a hit in China, they long for the transcendent experience of gazing upon Earth from space, Mr. Zhang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in the spaceflights is high even among those without the means to go. Some would-be space tourists have become minor celebrities long before the first liftoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Tong Jingling, a 40-year-old banker, booked a ticket in April, she started getting invitations from businesses to be their spokeswoman, she said. One company asked her to conduct medical experiments while in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tong, a graduate of <span class="companylink">Beihang University</span>, formerly known as the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, has capitalized on the attention by trying to launch several crowd-funded ventures. One would arrange weddings in space. Another would produce a reality television show in which contestants compete for a ticket for space travel. An investment of 100 renminbi, or $16, gets you a T-shirt that says, ''I want to go up into space'' in Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese are coming a bit late to space tourism. The first civilian space tour was in 2001, when the American billionaire Dennis Tito joined a Russian space mission and flew to the International Space Station. He spent $20 million and underwent months of training. Since then, six other civilians have made the same trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But companies are now selling suborbital trips to altitudes just beyond the Earth's atmosphere, at prices that put the dream of space travel within the reach of wealthy Chinese. After long delays caused by technical and safety issues, <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> and Virgin Galactic, founded by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson, say they are planning flights next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Virgin Galactic spacecraft are powered by rocket engines manufactured in the United States that use technology considered to have potential military applications, citizens from 22 countries, including China, are barred from traveling on them, the company has said. Virgin Galactic said it hoped that future United States government rulings would enable it to offer spaceflights to an expanded roster of nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span>'s Lynx shuttle uses different engines that do not appear to raise the same concerns. A $95,000 ticket with XCOR buys a flight late next year to an altitude of about 38 miles -- what the company calls ''the edge of space'' -- while a $100,000 ticket will take a passenger beyond the atmosphere in 2016. Each flight carries one passenger, who must undergo medical screening and training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zhang said he expects Chinese interest in space tourism to increase further once the first civilian flights are underway. ''Many from business circles and celebrities have told me that they'll buy tickets once the test flights succeed or the first tourists return safely,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Chinese who have booked seats said they had confidence in the safety of the shuttle technology, though some had not told their families of their plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhang Xiaoyu, 29, an entrepreneur in Beijing, said he told his parents only that he planned to fly at a ''relatively high altitude.'' He did not tell them how much the ticket cost, either. But Mr. Zhang said traveling to space meant more to him than putting a down payment on an apartment or buying a car in the congested Chinese capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You will be able to look back at the planet where you were born and experience complete solitude,'' he said. ''You wouldn't be able to experience this anywhere else.''</p>

Lighter-than-air vehicles conjure images of the Hindenburg, in its glory and destruction, and the Goodyear Blimp, a floating billboard that barely resembles its powerful predecessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now engineers are designing sleek new airships that could streak past layers of cloud and chart a course through the thin, icy air of the stratosphere, 65,000 feet above the ground -- twice the usual altitude of a jetliner. Steered by scientists below, these aerodynamic balloons might be equipped with onboard telescopes that peer into distant galaxies or gather oceanic data along a coastline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Stratospheric airships could give us spacelike conditions from a spacelike platform, but without the spacelike costs,'' said Sarah Miller, an astrophysicist at the <span class="companylink">University of California</span>, Irvine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-altitude airships are still in their relative infancy. None has ever flown at 65,000 feet for longer than eight hours. But a recent study from the Keck Institute for Space Studies at Caltech suggests that a more capable airship may not be far-off. And NASA is expected to sponsor a contest to build better airships, breathing new life -- and funding -- into the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These airships would not be the first vehicles to venture into the stratosphere, of course. Rockets and satellites routinely whiz past 65,000 feet into earth orbit and beyond, and weather balloons already bob about in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Balloons have been around for 200 years, so everybody thinks, well, gosh, it's such old technology, how hard can it be?'' said Steve Smith, an aerospace engineer who in 2005 designed one of the first successful stratospheric airships. ''That's the farthest thing from the truth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike free-flying weather balloons, a blimp can be actively maneuvered, providing the control necessary to carry out advanced missions with expensive equipment. But that maneuverability is compromised the moment it begins to lose its aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, airship design is a balancing act. During the day, the helium inside the balloon warms and expands; at night, it contracts as the temperature drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the real technical challenge,'' Mr. Smith said. ''You want enough gas in there so that it won't collapse at night, and strong materials so it won't burst during the day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This problem is compounded in a stratospheric airship, which must maintain its aerodynamic shape as it ascends through rapid temperature and pressure changes between layers of the atmosphere. For Mr. Smith's first successful stratospheric airship, the Hi-Sentinel 20, he chose a milky white polyester fabric that was tear-resistant and highly flexible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">United States Army</span> commissioned test flights of the Hi-Sentinel 20 to determine whether blimps could hoist communications satellites above enemy territory. The airship took off from New Mexico in 2005 and remained aloft only about eight hours, but it proved that an unmanned blimp could be steered through the stratosphere by a team of engineers on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: The HiSentinel airship. Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other test ships -- the Hi-Sentinel 50 and the Hi-Sentinel 80 -- were also successful. But the Army's interest waned with the end of the Iraq war, leaving Mr. Smith and his team short on funds. In search of a new market, he approached scientists with his promise of an inexpensive aircraft that could carry remote-controlled telescopes above the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Sarah Miller, who was then studying for her doctorate in astrophysics at Oxford. ''I took one look at the picture in the press release and I said, 'Oh, you could put a telescope on that,' '' she recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her research on hydrogen emissions in early galaxies had been stymied by a lack of space-based instrumentation -- even the Hubble Space Telescope was incapable of studying these particular emissions -- and she had been looking for a more convenient way to get her experiments above the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a few phone calls, it became clear to her that stratospheric airships were not ready to play host to her research. Mr. Smith's successful test flights had remained in the stratosphere only a matter of hours, a time limit that would make long-term research impossible. And Hi-Sentinel had never been tested with heavy scientific equipment on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They weren't at the technology readiness level that we'd entrust a large mission to them, or even a small mission, for that matter,'' Dr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a better idea of how stratospheric airships might fit into scientific research, Dr. Miller and colleagues prepared a lengthy analysis at the Keck Institute for Space Studies. The paper, published in February, found that conventional space satellites could cost up to 100 times as much as low-altitude, nonstratospheric airships. (There have been too few stratospheric airships to analyze their cost.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while satellites end their missions by falling to earth, incinerated beyond repair, airships could theoretically land, swap out their payloads and lift off for another round of research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the study, Dr. Miller and her colleagues asked other researchers whether they thought they might benefit from access to a stratospheric airship. To their surprise, they found that climate scientists were just as interested as cosmologists were in developing a low-cost, reusable platform for their research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really, there are two very broad scientific applications of stratospheric airships,'' said Jason Rhodes, an astrophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a co-author of the study. ''You can look up and do astronomy, or you can look down and do earth science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, climate scientists have used low-altitude blimps -- and their lighter-than-air cousins, weather balloons -- to sample atmospheric gases and have a bird's-eye view of local ecosystems. But high-endurance, high-altitude airships would allow scientists to study phenomena like the carbon cycle over extended periods at varying altitudes, and sample some of the less-understood greenhouses gases that contribute to climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meteorologists could fly stratospheric airships over hurricanes and tropical storms, tracking extreme weather in real time. Geologists told Dr. Miller's team that they would use such airships to explore layers of volcanic plumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only problem, the team found, is that stratospheric airships are expensive and complicated to test. Many qualified engineers had fled the lighter-than-air market after their projects were scrapped for lack of funds. To revitalize the airship market, the Keck study suggested that an institution offer a prize to the first civilian team to build a better stratospheric airship</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Dr. Rhodes took the Keck study's suggestion to his NASA colleagues. Keck studies carry substantial weight with NASA: A recent Keck paper suggested that the United States lasso an asteroid, a highly unconventional plan that NASA hopes to execute in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rhodes proposed that NASA fund a Centennial Challenge to bring engineers back into the airship market. Centennial Challenges offer millions of dollars in prize money to civilian teams that build innovative technologies for NASA missions. Over the next few months, Dr. Rhodes will research and refine the rules of the challenge, and explore how to push the limits of airships' payload and endurance. If NASA accepts the terms of the challenge, the race for a science-worthy stratospheric airship will begin shortly afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airships would not be the only research platforms in the stratosphere. Free-floating balloons routinely fly at 65,000 feet and higher, tethered to expensive scientific equipment. Barth Netterfield, an astrophysicist at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> who was not involved in the Keck study, has been launching lighter-than-air telescopes over Antarctica for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said powered airships would probably serve a different purpose from his simpler balloons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't care where we are as long as we're up,'' he said. ''So I'll launch from Antarctica, and the balloon just floats around there. That's fine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powered airships, by contrast, could provide a level of reliability that scientists need for advanced, expensive missions. Like conventional space satellites, balloons often crash into the sea, ending their voyage by destroying everything aboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a free-flying balloon, you may get stuck dropping your payload into the ocean,'' Dr. Netterfield said. ''With a powered airship, you can bring your payload down exactly where you want to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airship designers will face other obstacles, he said, including the question of weight. ''The big challenge is going to be getting the payload up to a useful mass for scientific experiments, and that's about one ton,'' he said, adding: ''It's a long road ahead. But if they pull it off, it could be quite interesting.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This occasional column explores topics covered in Science Times 25 years ago to see what has changed -- and what has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quarter century ago, NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft was closing in on Neptune for its final planetary visit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Science Times on Aug. 15, 1989, John Noble Wilford described the anticipation among the scientists about what they were calling the ''last picture show.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2, which would turn 12 a few days before its closest approach to Neptune on Aug. 25, was already elderly in spacecraft years -- ''arthritic and partially deaf, feeble of voice and prone to memory lapses,'' Mr. Wilford wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first features scientists saw was a dark spot in the southern hemisphere as wide as Earth -- a giant storm like the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. The wind on Neptune blew up to 1,500 miles per hour, the strongest in the solar system; its magnetic field tilted 47 degrees from the rotational axis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2 also discovered new moons and incomplete rings orbiting the planet. And on Triton, the largest moon, it photographed what appeared to be the frozen flows of ice volcanoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25 YEARS LATER The Hubble Space Telescope has had a few good looks at Neptune, beginning in 1994. By then, the storm, known as the Great Dark Spot, had disappeared, and a new dark spot emerged in the northern hemisphere. With limited Hubble observations, it is not known whether that spot remains or whether others have come and gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telescopes on Earth cannot make out the dark spots, but they can see bright clouds that were next to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the years, we have seen quite bright clouds come and go in both the north and south,'' said Heidi B. Hammel, a planetary astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Space Science Institute</span>. ''Right now, there are some very bright clouds in the north, but we have no approved Hubble programs to verify an underlying Great Dark Spot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others have gleaned new results from the old Voyager 2 photographs. Paul M. Schenk of the Lunar and <span class="companylink">Planetary Institute</span> in Houston and Kevin J. Zahnle of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., took a more careful look at the craters on Triton and argued that they all formed within the past 10 million years -- almost yesterday in geological terms. That would suggest not only ice volcanoes, but also an ocean below the surface with liquid breaking through and freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, a senior scientist at the <span class="companylink">Planetary Science Institute</span> in Tucson, said she had pushed for a new spacecraft to head to Neptune to explore these mysteries. Three of the four giant planets -- Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune -- line up over the next few years. That is not quite the ''grand tour'' of the Voyager spacecraft, but it would provide the gravitational boost for a quicker trip. ''You can get to Neptune in 10 years,'' Dr. Hansen-Koharcheck said, and the mission could fit under a billion dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA did not have enough plutonium to provide a power source for an outer solar system mission, and now it is almost certainly too late to start one before the window closes in 2020. So anything that planetary scientists learn about Neptune will come from Hubble and its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not going to get a close-up look at it for a very long time,'' said Carolyn C. Porco, who was a member of the Voyager imaging team. ''And there's so much to learn there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2 is indeed still operating, 9.75 billion miles away. Its twin, Voyager 1, entered interstellar space in August 2012, but Voyager 2 remains in the region known as the heliosheath, still dominated by the sun's magnetic field and outward-flowing particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Several more years is a reasonable estimate,'' said Edward C. Stone, the project scientist for the Voyagers both then and now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though it will be second out of the solar system, scientists are anxious for the data from one of Voyager 2's instruments, which measures solar wind particles. The equivalent instrument on Voyager 1 died in 1980.</p>

Yeah, it's dismaying that we humans can't look at anything without trying to figure out how to exploit it, but the technologies being explored are pretty cool. Instead of hauling equipment up there, how about printing it on a 3D printer using lunar materials?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Episode 2 examines the threat beloved by science-fiction scriptwriters everywhere, the prospect that our planet will again be struck by a giant asteroid. Various researchers are on the case, with ideas that include catching any threatening space rock in a giant bag and blasting it to bits with lasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are equally exotic in Episode 3, about efforts to put a human colony on Mars. One problem, the program notes, is the complexity of bringing people back from that planet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft -- the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3, better known as the zombie spaceship that was revived by a scrappy band of space enthusiasts -- will pass about 9,700 miles from the surface of the moon at 2:16 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The enthusiasts had hoped to nudge it much closer to the moon, just 30 miles from its surface; the moon's gravity would then have swung the spacecraft into orbit around Earth, from which it could have been catapulted on a new mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when they tried the course change on July 8, the thrusters sputtered. The craft's nitrogen tanks, needed to pressurize the propulsion system, had somehow emptied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although ISEE-3 and many of its scientific instruments are still working, there is now no way to steer the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, we were very, very disappointed,'' said Dennis Wingo, an engineer and entrepreneur who is a leader of the ISEE-3 Reboot Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the enthusiasts did not give up. They have commanded the craft to continue collecting scientific measurements and sending them back to Earth, an interplanetary exercise in ''citizen science'' that they hope will show NASA how to tap into the expertise of people outside the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A website started on Friday with help from <span class="companylink">Google</span>, space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">craftforall.com, offers an interactive history of the mission and an archive of the science data, including of the magnetic fields in space and the number of protons from the sun streaming by. The team will hold a live video chat on Sunday afternoon from its mission control, a former <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> at an old <span class="companylink">Navy</span> airfield north of San Jose, Calif., that is now part of a research park run by NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo said his team had turned on eight of the spacecraft's 14 experiments and recruited the help of some of the original mission scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include Michael Coplan, a physicist at the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> who, along with his students, helped build the ion composition instrument, which counted different types of charged atoms. Dr. Coplan had largely forgotten about the experiment after they received the last data in the late 1980s. This year, to clear space in a laboratory he would be sharing with another scientist, he threw out his ISEE-3 data notebooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in June, one of his former students heard about the reboot project and told Dr. Coplan, who went to the waste bin and found the notebooks. ''That sat around for a while, fortunately,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo said scientists were already comparing ISEE-3's data with observations from newer spacecraft. ''We're already in touch with the larger scientific community,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his team should be able to send commands to the craft for four more months before it is too far away, and moderate-size radio telescopes will be able to hear the spacecraft's signals for at least the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is still much we need to learn about the sun, and ISEE-3 will continue to contribute to gathering science data,'' Mr. Wingo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still a mystery is what happened to the nitrogen, especially as the first firing of the thrusters, on July 2, worked perfectly. Firings on July 8 also initially seemed to work, but then stopped. Two weeks of troubleshooting indicated that everything was working properly and the spacecraft had plenty of fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nitrogen tanks were empty. ''All of the options are equally unlikely, but one of them has to be the case,'' Mr. Wingo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The propulsion failure was a disappointment to Robert W. Farquhar, the flight director for ISEE-3 when it was launched in 1978. When he last fired the thrusters, in 1987, he deliberately set the spacecraft on a course to fly by Earth on Aug. 10, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm going to wave goodbye to the spacecraft,'' said Dr. Farquhar, who will be at the mission control at the former <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft's looping orbit around the sun will again put it in the vicinity of Earth 17 years from now. Might he plot something for it then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hah,'' said Dr. Farquhar, now 81. ''No.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A six-minute thruster firing at 5 a.m. Eastern time, the last in a series of 10 over the past few months, slowed Rosetta to the pace of a person walking, about two miles per hour relative to the speed of its target, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is like driving a car or a bus on a motorway for 10 years,'' said Andrea Accomazzo, the flight director, at a post-rendezvous news conference. ''Now we've entered downtown. We're downtown and we have to start orienting ourselves. We don't know the town yet, so we have to discover it first.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the coming months, Rosetta and its comet, called C-G for short, will plunge together toward the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, a small 220-pound lander is to leave the spacecraft, set down on the comet and harpoon itself to the surface, the first time a spacecraft will gently land on a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, the comet and its shadowing spacecraft are more than 330 million miles from the sun (more than three times as far out as Earth), traveling at 35,000 miles per hour. With the final firing of the thruster, Rosetta was a mere 60 miles from the comet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This morning, we hit a milestone, an important milestone of this mission,'' said Laurence O'Rourke, a member of its science team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But this mission isn't just about arriving at a comet,'' he went on. ''It's about studying the comet. It's about placing a lander on a comet, but again, the mission does not end there. The science continues. We're trying to follow this comet all around its orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in March 2004, Rosetta -- a boxy structure roughly nine by seven feet, powered by two 47-foot-long solar panels -- followed a circuitous route through the solar system, using flybys of the Earth and Mars to fling itself into the same orbital path as Comet C-G.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is still not close enough to be captured by the comet's gravity, but instead will be flying a triangular path in front of the comet as it maps the surface. It will eventually move within 6.2 miles of the surface and enter orbit around the comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets, made of ice, dust and rock, are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system. Rosetta is named after the Rosetta Stone, the engraved block that was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics, and scientists hope the spacecraft's observations will offer important clues to how the solar system came together 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photographs have revealed a surprisingly irregular shape for the two-and-a-half-mile-wide comet, possibly an amalgamation of two icy bodies or a result of uneven weathering during previous trips to the inner solar system. From a distance, the blurry blob looked something like a rubber duck; as it came into focus, it began to bear a closer resemblance to a knob of ginger flying through space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, Holger Sierks, principal investigator for Rosetta's high-resolution camera, revealed the latest images, pointing to cliffs, deep shadows and also flat areas with boulders sitting on the surface. ''We'll learn in the coming months what this is telling us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft had earlier measured the flow of water vapor streaming off the comet at a rate of about two cups a second, which would fill an Olympic-size swimming pool in about 100 days. As the comet accelerates toward the sun, its surface will warm, and the trickle will grow to a torrent a hundred or a thousand times that size, contributing to the long tail that is characteristic of comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unsolved mystery of Earth is where the water in the oceans came from; some suggest it came from comets. The water in comets from the distant Oort Cloud, far beyond Pluto, does not match the water on Earth, but the water in nearer comets may.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C-G is one of the nearer comets: Its orbit extends not far beyond Jupiter. Scientists should now be able to get a better idea of its composition by measuring temperatures at its surface and a few inches below, and in the gases streaming off the comet, along with the weight of water molecules streaming off it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the work in the next three months is to find a safe place for the lander, Philae, to set down. Once released from Rosetta, the lander will be pulled down by the comet's gravity and will strike its surface at a couple of miles per hour, like someone walking into a wall. ''It's hurting, but it doesn't kill you,'' said Stephan Ulamec, head of the consortium that built the lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The harpoons and a thruster will help keep it from bouncing off, though Dr. Ulamec said recent photographs suggested a dusty surface more like cigarette ash or newly fallen snow than ice. ''But actually, we do not know it yet,'' he said. ''We will only find out when we land there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed to operate through 2015, Rosetta and Philae will make observations as the comet makes its nearest approach to the sun a little more than a year from now, at 115 million miles, still outside the orbit of Earth. The comet will remain too dim to be seen by the naked eye.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 20 years, astronomers have found more than a thousand worlds -- exoplanets -- circling foreign stars. And they all have names only a mother robot could love. Some of them look or sound like caricatures of scientific notation, about as memorable as license plate numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I need a cheat sheet to remember which of these planets are which, and why they matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 7b, for example, is the ''Styrofoam planet'' discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, a Jupiter-size world so puffy it would float.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vast majority of stars -- like secret agents -- don't have names at all, only the numbers by which astronomers have laboriously listed them over the centuries. For example, HR 8799, which was seen by telescopes in Hawaii to have planets circling it like olives in a martini glass, is listed in the Yale Bright Star catalog, which was a successor to the Harvard Revised Photometry catalog, first published in 1884, thus the initials HR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there are planets, the star gets a lowercase ''a'' added to its number and its planets get b, c, d and so on, in the order in which they are discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It becomes even more confusing if the star is one of a double or a triple star. Alpha Centauri, only four light-years from here, is actually a double star, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. There is a third star, Proxima Centauri, sometimes called Alpha Centauri C, in the system. Alpha Centauri B is thought to have a planet, which would be the nearest exoplanet to Earth, and so is known as Alpha Centauri Bb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catchy, right? But now help is on the way. The <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>, in collaboration with Zooniverse, a website that promotes citizen participation in science, has announced a plan by which the public can vote on names for exoplanets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that these names will have the imprimatur of the world's professional astronomical community and will therefore be as official and authoritative as the numbers we now have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news is that this is the organization that kicked Pluto out of the club of major planets eight years ago, demoting it to dwarf status, as a result of a confusing and still controversial debate about what makes a planet. Never mind what schoolchildren have learned for the last 70 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules of NameExoWorlds, as the contest is called, are only a little less complicated. To begin with, not everyone gets to suggest names for these worlds. Only groups or astronomical organizations, like clubs or planetariums, that register on a website to be set up this fall will be eligible for the fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, not every planet is up for grabs. The Astronomical Union has posted a list of 260 planetary systems considered well established enough to be named. They include 305 planets. Most of them are single children -- one planet circling one star -- though some are in bigger families. The biggest is 55 Cancri, which has five planets circling a sunlike star about 40 light-years from here in the constellation Cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Registered groups will participate in a first round of voting to establish a shortlist of 20 or 30 of these systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then each group can propose names for just one ''exoworld,'' defined as a planet or planets with a host star. The hitch is that they will have to come up with appropriate names for all the members of the system, including the star. No cherry-picking your favorite planet and naming it, say, Trantor, after the center of the galactic empire in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge, then, as Thierry Montmerle of the Paris Institute of Astrophysics and general secretary of the Astronomical Union, explained in an email, lies in finding a theme for naming each body at once, like the solar system, with its names from Roman and Greek mythology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, Dr. Montmerle said, ''we should indeed think of the contest in terms of 'fun' -- 'educated fun,' that is.'' I could imagine a group of nicely synchronized planets named, for example, John, Paul, George and Ringo. Except that names of living people are forbidden, as are those of pets and religious or political figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this registering and proposing is a prelude to the main event. Once the names have been proposed, the public can vote on them. After a screening by yet another committee of the astronomical union, the winners will be announced at the group's meeting in Honolulu next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you think this is a bit clunky, you are not alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my view, it's too cumbersome, too ponderous and too controlling,'' said Alan Stern, an astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., who has at least a couple of bones to pick with the astronomical union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern, who is the lead scientist for the New Horizons mission that will arrive at Pluto next summer, disagreed with the decision to demote Pluto, calling it ''laughable.'' He is also a promoter of an alternate naming system known as Uwingu (pronounced oo-WING-oo, Swahili for ''sky''), which lets you propose names for exoplanets or craters on Mars for $9.99 apiece. The names go into an online database where anyone can vote on them (99 cents a vote). If your name gets 1,000 votes, you can choose which planet it goes with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money goes into the Uwingu Fund, which gives out grants for research and other worthy projects like combating light pollution or the Allen Telescope Array's search for extraterrestrial radio signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anything goes. You can propose the name of your dog or any of the Beatles. A brief perusal of the leading vote-getters at Uwingu recently turned up names like Aurelius, after the Roman emperor; Zeo Nio; No More Taxes; and Pale Blue Dot. The catch is that these names are not sanctioned by the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>. And the fact that you have to pay for them seems ''a bit squalid,'' in the words of Mike Brown, a Caltech astronomer whose discovery of a dwarf planet bigger than Pluto in 2005 (he called it Eris for the goddess of discord, natch) helped seal Pluto's fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a bigger problem in this frenzy of naming, as Dr. Brown pointed out. How many of these planets actually deserve names? How much will we ever know about any of them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We haven't yet discovered Earth 2.0, the twin that might be habitable, or anything with life, continents or any place a person could get a drink. Let's hope those are coming. And those are the worlds we will be talking about 20 or 50 years from now, the ones whose names schoolchildren will have to memorize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I understand how these things can lead to interesting public engagement, so I like it,'' Dr. Brown said of the astronomical union's plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, if it were up to me, I would hold my fire, save some of the best names, like Trantor or Sagan or Einstein -- or John, Paul, George and Ringo -- for when the galaxy has begun to fulfill its promise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps in the meantime, the astronomical union will continue to loosen up.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day early last year, the Australian comet hunter Robert H. McNaught spotted something unusual from his post at the Siding Spring Observatory in the foothills of the Warrumbungle Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a member of a team sponsored by NASA that searches the skies for potentially dangerous asteroids and comets, he generally focuses on objects that orbit the sun on the same plane as the planets. But coming up from below that plane was a comet that had apparently originated in the Oort cloud, a vast, primordial region that surrounds the solar system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comet was well beyond Jupiter when Mr. McNaught sighted it, but he and other so-called comet modelers were nonetheless able to predict its 125,000-mile-per-hour path into the inner solar system. To their surprise and consternation, it appeared to be heading straight for Mars, and some of their most precious equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet trajectories are notoriously changeable, and more recent projections suggest the comet, named Siding Spring, is highly unlikely to strike the planet or to do much damage to the two NASA rovers on its surface or the five research satellites orbiting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, on Oct. 19, the comet is expected to pass within 82,000 miles of Mars, a stone's throw in astronomical terms -- one-third the distance between Earth and the moon, and much closer to Mars than any comet has come to Earth in recorded history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dust, water vapor and other gases spewed by a comet can spread for tens of thousands of miles, so the upper reaches of the Martian atmosphere are expected to be showered by Siding Spring -- perhaps briefly, perhaps more extensively. Shock waves may rock the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dust particles may be tiny, but when traveling at 125,000 m.p.h. (35 miles per second) they would pierce the skin of any satellite orbiting the planet. ''Essentially, they would be like bullets out there,'' said Richard Zurek, the chief scientist of the Mars program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that although the danger to satellites and rovers appeared to be limited, there was a small possibility that the comet could break up as it approaches Mars -- a fate similar to that of Comet ISON as it neared the sun last year. As a precaution, the five satellites' orbits have been tweaked so they will be on the far side of the planet when the greatest threat from dust arrives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the most part, the initial worries have given way to excitement about the scientific opportunities presented by the very close encounter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellites and rovers -- along with ground and space observatories such as the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes -- will offer a front-row seat to the event, which may provide important images and science for days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an entirely unprecedented situation,'' said James Green, director of NASA's planetary science division and of its Mars program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We have an opportunity to see what happens when a comet comes so close to a planet,'' he continued. ''We can follow the planet as it responds to the dust and water and shock, and hope to learn more about how it processes it all. Comets have played a huge role in transforming planets, and now we'll see the process as it's happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 'Dirty Snowball'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comet Siding Spring is especially interesting because of its formation in the Oort cloud during the early days of the solar system, making it a ''long period'' comet with an orbit of millions of years. What's more, it is believed to be what comet specialists call a virgin -- one that has never reached the inner solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, its icy nucleus (the ''dirty snowball'' at the core of a comet) has never been thawed and reshaped, like those of comets that pass by more regularly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've studied the nuclei of comets before but never a long-period comet from the Oort cloud,'' Dr. Zurek said. ''The comet may well be bringing us primordial material unchanged since the creation of the solar system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As luck would have it, Siding Spring will pass Mars just a month after the arrival of NASA's newest orbiter, Maven, short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That satellite has instruments designed to study the Martian atmosphere, and in particular how water vapor and other material escape into space. Siding Spring may well produce atmospheric dynamics that the Maven team expected to study in a far more static state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If particles from the comet hit the atmosphere, we'll absolutely be able to measure what happens,'' said Bruce Jakosky, principal investigator for the satellite mission. Initially worried that the comet could damage Maven just as its mission began, he now sees the flyby as exploration science at its best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll follow how different chemical processes play out and will be looking to see if the arrival of those fast-moving dust particles, with all their energy, heats up the atmosphere,'' he said. ''We know there were lots of comet and asteroid impacts and near misses on early Mars, and now we're in a position to learn about some possible consequences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The implications for Mars science are substantial. The Curiosity rover has confirmed and substantially expanded earlier findings that Mars was warmer and much wetter a long time ago. But the question of how and when the planet lost those potentially life-supporting conditions remains largely unresolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because all the cameras orbiting above Mars are designed to focus on the planet, they are not expected to produce the best images of the flyby. That role is likely to be played by the Hubble and by observatories on Earth. Some believe that Curiosity might be lucky and snap an image of the comet passing above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One especially powerful orbiting camera, however, has a chance of capturing what is considered the most important and interesting part of the comet -- its nucleus, the ''dirty snowball.'' Little changed for billions of years, the ball of dust and ice warms as it enters the inner solar system and emits a vast surrounding cloud of material called the coma, followed by the long tail. The camera, named HiRise for High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, produces finely detailed images that have revolutionized our understanding of the Martian surface; now its operators will try to do the same for the comet's primordial nucleus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be tricky. Observations by NASA's Swift satellite suggest that the fast-moving nucleus is small, a half-mile to several miles across. ''The geometry is definitely challenging,'' said Alfred McEwen, the principal investigator for HiRise. ''We'll be orbiting Mars rapidly, and the comet will be whizzing by. And HiRise is designed to look down at Mars, not out at a comet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But especially if the nucleus is large, he said, HiRise might be able to capture at least a handful of pixels that would illustrate the primordial core of Siding Spring -- the first images of a long-period nucleus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McEwen said the team also planned to photograph jets of water vapor and dust that often shoot out of the nucleus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Journey From the Oort Cloud</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As described by NASA, Comet Siding Spring spent billions of years in the Oort cloud, named for the 20th-century Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first predicted its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most comets that form in the Oort cloud stay in place, orbiting the sun once every million to 30 million years. Sometimes, however, gravitational forces from nearby stars, or giant planets that many scientists believe wander in space, push a comet out of orbit and send it toward the sun. For Comet Siding Spring, that voyage has taken a million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers will also be using Earth and space observatories to identify the comet's chemical makeup. Of particular interest is what carbon-based organic compounds might be detected. These compounds, the building blocks of life, are known to reside in comets and asteroids. NASA's Stardust mission to the comet Wild 2 collected samples in 2006. In labs, scientists found not only organics in the stardust, but small yet detectable amounts of evolved amino acids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel P. Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center, was part of the team that found the amino acids in Wild 2, and now he is on the Curiosity science team. He called the Siding Spring flyby a useful reminder of how organics, with their potential to connect and form life, could be delivered from afar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't know how life begins, but we do know that organics are necessary,'' Dr. Glavin said. ''And how do organics appear? Maybe they're formed on the surface of a planet like Earth, or maybe they get delivered by comets like Siding Spring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main goals of the Curiosity mission is to search for organic compounds that might help show whether Mars was once habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Siding Spring is not expected to get close enough to send organic compounds to the surface, but Dr. Green, NASA's Mars program director, does not want to take any chances. Although Curiosity will be in a defensive position for the flyby, he has plans for the small scoop that the rover uses to deliver crushed rock samples to the instruments inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I told the Curiosity team is that the chances are very slight that organics or comet dust would fall on the rover,'' he said. ''But we should have the scoop out to catch some just in case.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space agency officials on Thursday unveiled seven instruments they plan to put on a Martian rover that would launch in 2020, including two devices aimed at bigger future Mars missions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.9 billion rover will include an experiment that will turn carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere into oxygen. William H. Gerstenmaier, an associate administrator for NASA, said the oxygen could then be used to make rocket fuel and for future astronauts to breathe. Taking fuel to Mars for return flights would be heavy and expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The device, named Moxie, operates like an engine but in reverse, said Michael Hecht, the scientist at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who is running the test project. It will make about three-quarters of an ounce of oxygen an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it works, then a larger device -- 100 times as big as Moxie -- would be launched two years before astronauts go, currently scheduled for some time in the 2030s. NASA first plans to send astronauts to an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger device would start making enough oxygen for the return trip before astronauts ever launch to Mars, Dr. Hecht said. The other part of rocket fuel, the propellant, can be made from light hydrogen that is brought from Earth or other chemicals mined from Martian dirt or atmosphere.</p>

The shock generated when the cloud smashed into gas surrounding the black hole, 26,000 light-years from Earth, could have produced radio waves, X-rays and a possible brightening of infrared light. But researchers saw nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New observations of the cloud, known as G2 -- along with a neighboring gas cloud, G1, that passed close to the black hole 13 years ago -- have led astronomers to an intriguing explanation for the light show that wasn't.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Gillessen of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and his colleagues found that G1 and G2 have identical orbits that lie in the same plane as that of young stars near the Milky Way's center. The team suggests that both clouds, along with a gas tail that appears to be trailing G2, are all part of a stream of gas that gravity ripped from the envelope of a young star about 100 years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like rocks carried by a swift current, the clouds may be dense lumps embedded in the moving gas stream. There may be additional lumps in the tail that could serve as future snacks for the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That interpretation is open for debate. But if it proves correct, the stream may act like a buffer between the clouds and the gas already surrounding the black hole, preventing G1 and G2 from generating a violent shock and radiation, Dr. Gillessen's team suggests in an article posted last week on the Cornell Library physical sciences site arXiv.org.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fireworks could ensue years to decades from now, when material from G2, estimated to be as massive as three Earths, finally spirals into the maw of Sagittarius A*. Just how quickly that happens will reveal new clues about the eating habits of black holes like Sagittarius A*, which is now on a near-starvation diet, said Avi Loeb of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, who was not part of the study.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- WHEN we think about space missions, what generally comes to mind are large rooms filled with rocket scientists at consoles that control expensive new spacecraft doing unintelligible things. That's still the norm but, in fact, there doesn't need to be an entrance exam for people who want to explore space, and we've proved it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, my colleague, the space technologist Dennis Wingo, and I formed a small team of volunteers and aerospace engineers to rescue the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3 for short, which left Earth in 1978. The original mission of this unmanned craft was to study space weather: how activity on the sun affects us on Earth. After that initial mission, it became the first spacecraft to encounter a comet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That second mission complete, NASA had no further use for ISEE-3 and abandoned it to orbit the sun. But NASA left most of its systems, including the radio transmitters, switched on in case it decided to recover the craft as it passed once more near Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, though, there was no way to recover ISEE-3. But it will still pass near Earth on Aug. 10 -- creating the theoretical possibility that, if the engines could be fired remotely before the ship swung back into space, it could be brought back into our orbit. As ISEE-3 neared Earth, NASA had neither the funds nor the now-obsolete technology to operate it. But we believed we could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISEE-3 Reboot Project's plan was simple: contact ISEE-3, fire its engines and change its orbit. Why? First, because we could: Recycling this piece of space hardware seemed cool and fun. And second, because it might generate useful scientific data -- and we could take people all over the world along for the ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reboot Project team set about raising funds and seeking expertise. To cover costs, our project used crowd-funding. We raised $159,602; the majority of donors giving $10 to $50. Most were not the usual space enthusiasts but belonged to a much larger pool of people than NASA usually engages: artists, athletes, retail clerks, farmers -- anyone, in fact, who looks up at the night sky with yearning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISEE-3 was, in essence, an abandoned, derelict spaceship, but NASA still owned it and would have to give permission to anyone else who wanted to operate it. NASA never said no. Eventually, it said yes and we signed a formal agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To save money, our ''mission control'' is in an abandoned <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> restaurant near NASA's Ames Research Center here. The technical challenges were considerable. Over the decades, NASA had disposed of the hardware needed to talk to ISEE-3, and rebuilding parts would have cost millions. Instead, we came up with a computer-controlled radio that uses software to mimic the behavior of the defunct hardware. And we hunted for old documents in the basements of retired NASA engineers to recreate the command language the system needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have managed to do many things that space pros doubted were possible: contact and command the spacecraft, obtain telemetry and, most important, fire ISEE-3's engines. Getting the engines to fire reliably and produce enough thrust has proved difficult, but we're still brainstorming long-distance plumbing solutions to get them working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When our volunteer team of aerospace professionals encounters obstacles, we use <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> to ask for help -- it arrives in abundance within hours from our thousands of followers and donors. Even if we don't succeed in changing the spaceship's trajectory, we have a plan that will let us receive scientific data no matter where ISEE-3 goes, for as long as its systems hold out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of ISEE-3's science instruments have failed, but many are sending back data. A few weeks ago, the ship's magnetometer detected a solar event that was confirmed by other spacecraft. Such instruments were designed to work for only a few years, yet they're still functioning even after exposure to five times the level of radiation the craft was designed to withstand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISEE-3's solar cells are also in much better condition after 36 years than anyone at NASA imagined. The agency told us that these findings alone have valuable implications for future spacecraft design and have already justified our efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After half a century of launching things into space, there is a lot of stuff out there. Much of it is in a gray zone between ''useful'' and ''useless,'' with the potential to be repurposed; ISEE-3 is but one example. Many functioning spacecraft can no longer perform their original tasks, but their sensors and telescopes could still be used to gather valuable scientific data for a fraction of the cost of putting one into space in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government space missions are expensive. New private-sector space ventures always seem to involve billionaires. Yet we achieved results by raising funds a few dollars at a time -- and by involving our donors directly in our work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA likes to say that ''space is hard,'' but to make itself relevant to the people whose taxes fund it, it must get outside its comfort zone. To its credit, NASA saw the potential of our project to reach beyond the traditional audience. The interactions via social media with our supporters have borne this out. Imagine what feats of exploration might be possible if an empowered and engaged citizenry realized that exploring space is really something anyone can do.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before reviving a zombie spacecraft, Dennis Wingo and Keith Cowing traveled to the past to rescue a trove of early moon photographs that otherwise would have been destined for oblivion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They did not actually time travel, but that might have been easier.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past couple of months, Mr. Wingo and Mr. Cowing have popped into the news for re-establishing contact with a 36-year-old spacecraft, NASA's International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3, which is quickly approaching Earth after a long trip circling the inner solar system. NASA retired ISEE-3 in 1997 and then dismantled the transmitter for talking to it, but most of the systems on the craft remain operational. A shoestring effort led by Mr. Wingo and Mr. Cowing got back in touch with ISEE-3 in May, although last week they ran into possibly insurmountable problems trying to fire the thrusters and change its course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo, an entrepreneur and an engineer, and Mr. Cowing, the editor in chief of the NASA Watch website, had confidence that they could decipher decades-obsolete NASA equipment, because, as Mr. Cowing said, ''we've done this before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earlier project involved 1,500 magnetic tapes and a couple of old, broken tape drives. In 1966 and 1967, NASA sent five robotic spacecraft, the Lunar Orbiters, to photograph the moon's surface to help find safe landing sites for the Apollo astronauts. The tapes, which recorded the original high-resolution images, and the tape drives ended up in the garage of a former NASA employee, and Mr. Wingo and Mr. Cowing embarked on a quixotic mission to retrieve the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the antithesis of your typical NASA project,'' Mr. Cowing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Museum of Art</span> in Pittsburgh posted a 22-minute documentary about that project, part of a series of short films looking at how modern digital technologies are transforming photography. An earlier episode showed how a forensic analysis of computer disks discovered previously unknown works by Andy Warhol. This week, the Carnegie team is in Switzerland, working on its next installment, about the CERN particle physics laboratory and how it employs techniques of photography to record the ephemeral tracks of subatomic particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're fascinated by that,'' said Divya Rao Heffley, the program manager for the Hillman Photography Initiative at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Museum</span>. ''The subject matter is hidden and made visible by photography.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Lunar Orbiter project, Mr. Wingo and Mr. Cowing in 2007 rented a couple of trucks and drove the tapes and tape drives to NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., setting up shop in a former <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, which they nicknamed McMoon's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't think of a better use for an old <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>,'' S. Pete Worden, the director of NASA Ames, says in the documentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, they conducted a long-odds hunt for old manuals and data and fortuitous connections that put Mr. Wingo and Mr. Cowing in touch with people who knew how the tape drives worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like having one wing of the <span class="companylink">Library of Alexandria</span> suddenly dropped in your lap,'' Mr. Cowing says in the film. ''And you just have to figure out the card catalog. That was the hard part.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old electronics were hosed down and refurbished. In the film, Mr. Wingo demonstrates how he has to stop the spinning tape with his finger, because the tape drive's braking mechanism no longer functions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet everything worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They got the images over several years starting in 2008 -- much sharper than earlier versions that had been photographed off television screens as the data was beamed back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With ISEE-3, engineers have similarly wrestled with missing manuals and balky mechanics. Mission control is in McMoon's, next to the deep fryers. The hope is to fire the thrusters to nudge the spacecraft on a trajectory where it will fly close to the moon and be captured into orbit around Earth. But last week, when they attempted the course correction maneuver, the thrusters sputtered. A troubleshooting session the next day suggested that nitrogen gas, used to push fuel to the thrusters, had leaked away over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team put out a call for help on the Internet, and experts chimed in with information and suggestions. ''Because why not?'' Mr. Cowing said. ''We needed help. We asked. We got great help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the discussions, the team came up with a repair plan, and on Wednesday, it will send commands that could clear possibly clogged fuel lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're all space plumbers now,'' Mr. Cowing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the propulsion system cannot be fixed and ISEE-3 zooms past Earth, the plan is to stay in contact and have the spacecraft send back scientific readings as it continues to orbit around the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's Mr. Cowing and Mr. Wingo's next project: an intercontinental ballistic missile lying on its side in the parking lot next to McMoon's. The Titan 1 missile, a relic from the 1960s, had been on display at Ames for years and is still intact, except for the warhead. ''They wouldn't give me that,'' Mr. Cowing said. ''I asked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would like to refurbish it and transform it into a display that shows how rockets work, including having some of the moving parts move again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just like getting old stuff and giving it a new purpose,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without thrusters, there is no way to push the 36-year-old spacecraft, the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3, onto a trajectory to be captured back in Earth orbit. Instead, ISEE-3, which is otherwise in working order, will just fly by.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Odds are, there is nothing we can do,'' Keith Cowing, a leader of the effort, said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISEE-3, launched in 1978, was designed to measure the wind that blows from the sun and buffets the Earth's magnetic field. Later, it was sent to fly through the tail of a comet. After those successes, a few final firings of its thrusters in 1986 put it on course to rendezvous back with Earth in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, NASA retired the probe and dismantled the transmitters needed to talk to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Mr. Cowing, the editor in chief of the website NASA Watch, and Dennis Wingo, an engineer and entrepreneur, embarked on an effort to re-establish contact and capture ISEE-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After raising almost $160,000 on the Internet, they installed a new transmitter at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico and set up mission control at Skycorp, Mr. Wingo's company, in a former <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> near San Jose, Calif. They successfully radioed the spacecraft in May and last week fired the thrusters to speed up its spinning motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, they attempted a longer series of firings to adjust course for a close pass of the moon on Aug. 10 that would sling it into orbit around Earth. But the thrusters sputtered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the team tried firings with different permutations of tanks, valves and thrusters. None worked, leading the engineers to suspect that the problem was not mechanical, but empty tanks. The nitrogen is used to squeeze the fuel, hydrazine, to the thrusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without that, you don't have a rocket,'' Mr. Cowing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a small chance that ISEE-3 is on course to slam into the moon on Aug. 10. A communication session on Friday will help determine its path. If it misses the moon, it will again wander in a looping orbit around the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm going to wave to it as it goes by,'' said Robert W. Farquhar, who was the spacecraft's project scientist when ISEE-3 launched and who came up with the idea of sending it to visit a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though they might not be able to capture the spacecraft, Mr. Cowing said they were devising an alternative in which ISEE-3 would collect scientific data and send it back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a Plan B,'' he said. ''We're going to listen to the spacecraft as long as it talks.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first part of the maneuver succeeded, a milestone in an effort to resurrect a zombie spacecraft that NASA abandoned 17 years ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then -- perhaps to be expected during work on a jalopy -- problems cropped up, and the thrusters failed to fire properly. Another attempt to complete the course correction will be made Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel like it is taunting us sometimes,'' Keith Cowing, one of the leaders of the effort, said of the 36-year-old spacecraft, the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not NASA commanding the spacecraft now, but a group of civilians working in a former <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> in California taking advantage of technological goodies of the 21st century, including Skype, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, laptop computers and crowdsourcing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISEE-3 is still about three million miles away, but is closing in quickly on Earth's neighborhood. It will pass close to the moon next month, and if the team can complete the course correction, the pull of the moon's gravity will sling ISEE-3 into orbit around Earth, where it will await commands for a new mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in 1978, the craft made some of the first measurements of the solar wind -- the stream of particles ejected from the sun -- before it reached Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years later, ISEE-3 was redirected to fly through the tail of Comet Giacobini-Zinner. Then, in 1986, it was put on a course toward home. NASA, however, retired the spacecraft in 1997 and soon after dismantled the transmitters that could talk to it. As ISEE-3 approached, the agency decided it would be too expensive to build new transmitters to get back in touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cowing, the editor in chief of the website NASA Watch, and Dennis Wingo, an engineer and entrepreneur, jumped in to fill the void. A crowdfunding campaign raised nearly $160,000. In May, they re-established communications with the spacecraft. NASA agreed to help, offering time on its Deep Space Network of radio telescopes to fine-tune measurements of the spacecraft's trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the scientific instruments still appeared to be working. The magnetometer observed the rumblings of a recent solar outburst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, the thrusters fired 11 pulses to speed up the spin of the spacecraft slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That set the stage for Tuesday's maneuver, which was to fire more than 400 pulses to nudge the spacecraft onto a path that would take it close to the moon without crashing into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission control is at Mr. Wingo's company, Skycorp, which has its offices in the old <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> on a former <span class="companylink">Navy</span> outpost near San Jose, Calif. There, the volunteers work on laptops that send commands to the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1:46 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, Mr. Cowing posted on the ISEE-3 Reboot Project's <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account: ''Command initiate SENT!!!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first series of 63 pulses appeared to go off without a hitch. But something did not work correctly during the second round of pulses, and the spacecraft failed to accelerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the valves may not have been in the right position, preventing the fuel from firing at full speed. ''In other words #ISEE3 thrusters 'burped,' '' the next <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> post explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team made a couple of more attempts before it ran out of its allotted time at Arecibo. Just as they encountered and surmounted earlier glitches, the engineers will try to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just a learning process with this thing,'' Mr. Cowing said. ''It's probably going to take a day or two.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the planet's existence was almost immediately called into question, with some researchers unable to locate it. Now, a team at Penn State is saying that Gliese 581g and a presumed neighbor planet, Gliese 581d, were simply illusions caused by the star they supposedly orbited.</p>

Such activity can sometimes stimulate the emission of hydrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all is not lost, said the study's lead author, Paul Robertson, an astronomer at Penn State. Correcting for the magnetic activity also increased the signals for other planets long thought to orbit Gliese 581.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found evidence for stellar noise in the data that has been published previously, and when we corrected for that, we got this really nice dichotomy,'' he said. ''The real planets and their signals get much stronger, but these planets d and g, their signals disappeared.'' Though their findings, which were published in the journal Science, may represent the end of the road for Gliese 581g, it could yield a useful new method for identifying planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm hoping that this will provide a nice resolution to the dispute,'' Dr. Robertson said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $468 million Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 mission had to be put off when Tuesday's launching attempt was halted with just 46 seconds left in the countdown. Technicians spent the day replacing a defective valve in the system that sprays water beneath the rocket during liftoff.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Delta 2 rocket carrying the satellite lifted off at 5:56 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday and rose to 429 miles above earth. The success comes five years after the loss of the mission's original satellite: its clamshell nose cone failed to separate, and the spacecraft splashed into the ocean off Antarctica. At the end of 2009, the Obama administration gave the go-ahead to build a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next 10 days, flight controllers will check out the spacecraft, and will then nudge it over three weeks into its final destination, 438 miles up in an orbit passing over the North and South Poles, where it will take its position at the front of a parade of other earth-observing spacecraft. The mission is to last at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observatory carries a single instrument, which will measure carbon dioxide levels by looking at the intensity of colors of sunlight bouncing off the earth (carbon dioxide absorbs certain colors, but not others).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burning of fossil fuels and other human activities releases on average 100 million tons of carbon dioxide a day in the air, and the pace of emissions continues to speed up. The atmosphere's levels of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and contributes to warming temperatures, recently reached 400 parts per million, up 40 percent since the start of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observatory will make a million measurements a day, although interference by clouds means that perhaps only 10 percent will turn out to be useful. That will still provide a bounty of data for scientists looking to gain a clearer picture of what happens to the carbon dioxide, only half of which stays up in the air. A quarter of the emissions is absorbed by the oceans; another quarter is believed to be taken up by plants growing on land, but scientists do not have detailed data to see exactly where. The patterns also change with the seasons and can be affected by floods and droughts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's something really neat going on,'' said David Crisp, the head of the mission's science team. ''We just need to find it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 is the second of five launchings this year for earth science missions as NASA replenishes its aging fleet. Before Wednesday's launching, the space agency had 16 spacecraft to observe the earth from orbit; 13 of them are beyond their designed lifetimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This year and indeed the rest of the decade will be extremely busy times as we bring to culmination many years of effort to reinvigorate the space-based component of our earth-based observations,'' said Michael Freilich, director of NASA's earth science division.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the maximum -- the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle, when the sun erupts with solar flares and energetic bursts of electrons and protons -- may have already passed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As solar maximums go, this has been a tepid one, particularly when measured against some predictions that it would be ferocious; it has been called a ''minimax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neither does it rival a quiet period in the second half of the 1600s that coincided with the onset of the Little Ice Age, a prolonged chill in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This cycle is not abnormally small,'' said W. Dean Pesnell, the project scientist for NASA's orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory. Of the 24 solar cycles since the mid-1750s when people began keeping detailed counts of sunspots, ''it looks like fifth smallest,'' he continued. ''It might be the fourth. It might be the sixth. It's not going to be at the bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sun erupted with several giant solar flares last month but has been mostly quiet the past two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the general consensus is that we've passed the peak,'' said C. Alex Young, a solar astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added that some of the biggest solar storms in history occurred on the downward side of the solar cycle, and even a weak cycle can generate ferocious outbursts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the expectation right now is we might see another burst of this activity five or six months from now,'' Dr. Young said. ''We might still have some big events.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more than anything else, the current maximum has taught solar scientists that they have a lot more to learn about the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, at the end of the previous solar cycle, Mausumi Dikpati, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., undertook an ambitious endeavor -- a computer model using the basic physics of the sun to forecast what would happen next. Her model made two main predictions: The cycle would start slowly, and it would be a big one, one-third to one-half stronger than the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her first prediction came to pass. The lull stretched for four more years, leading to some speculation that the sun was on the cusp of another Maunder Minimum, the sunspotless era of the 1600s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Although the Maunder Minimum coincided with the Little Ice Age, it is not known whether the intensity of a sunspot cycle could influence the earth's climate. The difference in the amount of the earth-warming radiation coming from the sun between solar minimum and solar maximum is minuscule.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her second prediction was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, that was because the model did not capture the sun's split personality this time around. The sunspots peaked first in the sun's northern hemisphere, in 2011, and then faded away, leading to an intermission when the sun was almost blank at what was supposed to be maximum. Solar physicists expected that the southern hemisphere would belatedly perk up, and last fall it did, producing a second peak that was larger than the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was very unusual,'' Dr. Dikpati said. ''If they would have overlapped, it would have been a strong cycle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dikpati and Dr. Pesnell were members of a panel that was to come up with a consensus prediction in 2007 but could not. The panel instead split, some agreeing with Dr. Dikpati on a strong maximum. Others, including Dr. Pesnell, expected a weak maximum, based on other indicators like the strength of the magnetic fields near the poles at solar minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That one worked pretty well,'' Dr. Pesnell said. ''But now we'll get in a room and harrumph for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will have more data to think about. Convection within the sun moves gases from the equator toward the poles, and many solar scientists think the speed of that flow helps determine the strength of the sunspot cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some argue that a faster flow induces stronger magnetic fields and more sunspots. Others argue the reverse, that a faster flow inhibits sunspots. Not only do the scientists disagree on the theory, but at present they do not even agree how fast the flow is moving, with different techniques measuring different speeds, Dr. Pesnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting better, and we argue,'' he said. ''That's how we do science.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Roscosmos</span> tentatively rescheduled the launch for Saturday afternoon, suggesting, at least preliminarily, that the problem was not serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Angara rocket has been in development for more than 20 years, since shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is intended to become the primary vehicle for Russia's unmanned space missions and to secure the independence of the Russian space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket has some crucial benefits for Russia. It can be launched from Plesetsk, rather than the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which Russia uses under a long-term lease agreement with its southern neighbor. The Angara is also manufactured entirely by Russia, potentially reducing its reliance on foreign rocket technology, especially from Ukraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conflict with Ukraine has underscored the need for Russia to produce its own rockets, some Russian officials have said. At the same time, the United States is entirely dependent on Russia for its manned space program, including trips to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's space program has suffered several humiliating failures in recent years, many involving the existing generation of Proton-M rockets. In the latest setback, a Proton-M carrying a sophisticated communications satellite crashed last month shortly after takeoff from Baikonur, apparently as a result of engine failure.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of astronomers who announced in March that they had detected space-time disturbances -- gravitational waves -- from the beginning of the Big Bang reaffirmed their claim on Thursday but conceded that dust from the Milky Way galaxy might have interfered with their observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original announcement, heralding what the astronomers said could be ''a new era'' in cosmology, astounded and exhilarated scientists around the world. At a splashy news conference on March 17 at the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> in Cambridge, Mass., the talk quickly turned to multiple universes and Nobel Prizes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as reporters and scientists were gathering there, others convened on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and elsewhere to pick apart the findings. What ensued was a rare example of the scientific process -- sharp elbows, egos and all -- that played out the last three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the findings are indeed true, the detection of those gravitational waves would confirm a theory that the universe began with a violent outward antigravitational swoosh known as inflation -- a notion that would explain the uniformity of the heavens, among other mysteries, and put physicists in touch with quantum forces that prevailed when the universe was only a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. The idea once seemed like science fiction, but the astronomers' findings put it almost in reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As everyone involved said at the time, however, the results needed to be confirmed; it was far too soon to book travel to those other universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after weeks of wrangling, discussion and debate with peer reviewers and other astrophysicists, the group, which goes by the name Bicep, has published its paper in the journal Physical Review Letters. The authors, led by John Kovac of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, write that they stand by their discovery -- but they also now acknowledge that it is possible that interstellar dust might have produced much or even all of their signal. New data expected within weeks from the Planck satellite of the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> and other experiments should help clarify the situation, the authors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The basic takeaway has not changed; we have high confidence in our results,'' Dr. Kovac said in a phone call from a conference in Moscow. But, he added, ''new information from Planck makes it look like pre-Planckian predictions of dust were too low.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the Bicep team's critics had said the astronomers might have spoken too soon, before all the uncertainties in the observations were nailed down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not saying it's not there,'' Raphael Flauger, a theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and at <span class="companylink">New York University</span> who has worked on inflation, said of the gravitational wave signal. But because of uncertainty about the dust, he said in a recent paper, ''no cosmological inference can be drawn at this time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dissection of the Bicep report has been conducted in a storm of talks, workshops, papers posted on the Internet, jokes and whispers. Rumors have circulated that the astronomers would withdraw their claim. Some of those speaking out were early universe theorists looking for confirmation that their dreams had come true. Some were members of the dozen or so groups around the world conducting competing experiments. Still others were advocates of alternative theories that would die if this one was right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, the Bicep group has maintained radio silence. ''It's our job to take the heat and respond as we can,'' said Jamie Bock of the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, another of the group's leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kovac said, ''We've been trying not to seed the dialogue, but rather focus on the scientific process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The putative gravitational waves are the subtlest and most profoundly mysterious features discovered yet in a thin haze of microwaves, known as the cosmic background radiation, left over from end of the Big Bang, when the cosmos was about 380,000 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the prevailing theory, the violent onset of inflation, which happened less than a trillionth of a second after time began, should have left ripples in space-time. These ripples, known as gravitational waves, would manifest as corkscrew patterns in the direction of polarization of the cosmic microwaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bicep group -- its name is an acronym for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization -- is led by Dr. Kovac; Dr. Bock; Clement Pryke, now of the <span class="companylink">University of Minnesota</span>; and Chao-Lin Kuo of <span class="companylink">Stanford</span>. They have deployed a series of ever more sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said in March that their second telescope, Bicep2, which was able to peer far deeper into the cosmic background than any previous experiment, had detected the corkscrew patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But things besides quantum ripples from the beginning of time could produce those swirls, including polarized light from interstellar dust grains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kovac and his colleagues concluded, however, that there was little or no polarized dust in their patch of sky. One piece of evidence they brandished was based on a preliminary map of polarized dust produced by the Planck satellite and shown at a conference last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Flauger, however, said he suspected the Bicep group had misread the Planck map, which is based on unpublished data. He did his own analysis under different assumptions and came to the opposite conclusion: The dust had been underestimated and could indeed be a real problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was disappointing, Dr. Flauger said. ''Just like everyone else, I was excited,'' he said. ''If true, it was possibly biggest discovery of my lifetime. I just wanted to know what's going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that such an important discovery hinged on unpublished data derived from a map shown only once raised eyebrows. Dr. Bock defended the approach, given that the data was the best available at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the paper published Thursday, the Bicep astronomers have dropped the disputed Planck map, citing ''unquantifiable uncertainty.'' But it changes little, they say. The remaining theoretical models all suggest there is not enough dust to be a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Flauger said Thursday that the new version was ''substantially weaker than before,'' noting several cautionary comments. The statement that more data is needed to resolve the situation is significant, he said: ''Strictly speaking, this means it was not a detection of primordial gravitational waves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he worried that the controversy over what the Bicep observations meant would overshadow what a triumph it had been to see so deep into the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that the Bicep team was able to make these measurements is an incredible achievement,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kovac said the group was in negotiations with the Planck team to collaborate on a more thorough study of the dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, he and his colleagues contend that the best answer is that gravitational waves are the source of the Bicep signal. If that is true, they write, it does indeed herald a new era of cosmology. But if it is dust, they conclude, ''it reveals the scale of the challenges that lie ahead.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- The <span class="companylink">Airbus Group</span> and Safran of France plan to merge their satellite launching activities into a new company that aims to better compete against lower-cost rivals from Russia and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies said on Monday that they expected their 50-50 joint venture to be up and running before the end of this year, combining <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s expertise in launcher systems with Safran's rocket engine technology.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, which was earlier presented to President François Hollande of France, is the first concrete step toward streamlining Europe's fragmented space business. It comes in response to mounting pressure from the region's biggest commercial satellite companies for more affordable launches by European companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hollande hailed the agreement as ''a major step toward the consolidation of the European space program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s space division is leading the early stages of development for a successor to Europe's highly successful Ariane 5 rocket, called the Ariane 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20 member states of the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> are expected to decide by December whether to proceed with the project, which is budgeted at 3 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, and is expected to take to the heavens in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellite companies have warned that costs must come down if Europe hopes to remain competitive with the likes of Russia and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the American space launch company set up by the billionaire Elon Musk, as well as dozens of smaller would-be competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> charges around $60 million to carry a satellite to orbit aboard one of its Falcon rockets, nearly half the cost of the Ariane 5 and competitors like Russia's Proton-M. The Ariane 6 is expected to eventually cost around $100 million for each launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an April letter to the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, the chief executives of seven leading European satellite operators, including <span class="companylink">Inmarsat</span>, Intelsat and Eutelsat, warned that ''considerable efforts to restore competitiveness in price of the existing European launcher need to be undertaken if Europe is to maintain its market situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial details of the Airbus-Safran venture were not disclosed. But the companies pledged to work together to further develop the Ariane 6 launcher as well as an intermediate version of the Ariane 5 called the Ariane 5ME, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our agreement with Safran is the starting point of an exciting journey towards a more integrated, more efficient and hence more profitable launcher business in Europe,'' Thomas Enders, the <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> group chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the odds were good that the new Airbus-Safran venture would be able to bring European space launch prices down enough to be competitive with <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> within a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The technology is there,'' said Michael Blades, an analyst for the research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan, who studies the commercial space launch industry. ''It's just going to take time for them to figure out how to offer that technology in a more cost-effective way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason that European launchers have been able to charge a premium until now is their 30-year track record of reliability, Mr. Blades said. But that gap is closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is gaining ground in that area quickly,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $6.5 billion global satellite launch business is dominated by Russian vehicles, which have been used to carry 42 percent of commercial satellites into orbit over the past decade, according to figures from the <span class="companylink">United States Department of Transportation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's share of that market is just under 25 percent, followed by the United States with 16 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's strong position was highlighted recently when Western tensions with Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine raised questions of whether a number of planned commercial satellite launches using Russian technology might be derailed by the threat of tightening trade restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, <span class="companylink">COM DEV International</span>, a Canadian satellite manufacturer, canceled a June launch from Kazakhstan of a maritime-tracking satellite aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other pending launches aboard Russian rockets this year include a $1.6 billion fleet of mobile broadband satellites operated by <span class="companylink">Inmarsat</span> of Britain. <span class="companylink">Inmarsat</span> has said it does not currently expect its launch plans to be affected by sanctions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, Elizabeth Brownrigg was sent to the gallows for torturing a young orphan for weeks, including tying her to a hook, stripping her naked and horsewhipping her until ''the blood gushed in torrents from her wounds'' and she died.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those days, British society and its criminal justice system, did not distinguish between violent and nonviolent crimes. Pickpockets and murderers equally deserved the death penalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so just 60 years later. A murderer might be executed or exiled to Australia, but a pickpocket would probably only pay a fine. Grounds for capital punishment shifted. Violent and nonviolent crimes fell into separate realms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did this change happen? Leave it to generations of British bureaucrats to help provide answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1674 through 1913, court reporters wrote detailed accounts of virtually every trial held at the Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey, where all major criminal cases for Greater London were heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The corpus includes 121 million words describing 197,000 trials over 239 years. According to researchers, it represents the largest existing body of transcribed trial evidence for historical crime; it is, they say, the most detailed recording of real speech in printed form anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have now carried out a computational analysis of those words showing how the British justice system created new practices for controlling violence. The study, ''The Civilizing Process in London's Old Bailey,'' in The Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span>, is a collaboration between two computer scientists, Simon DeDeo of Indiana University and Sara Klingenstein of the Santa Fe Institute, and a historian, Tim Hitchcock of the <span class="companylink">University of Sussex</span> in England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This study demonstrates ''an important new way to do historical research,'' said Brett Bobley, director of digital humanities at the <span class="companylink">National Endowment for the Humanities</span>. Historians may study collections of individual items -- books, old letters or newspapers -- but they can't read an entire library; computers, he said, can do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Pinker, the <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> linguist and author of ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,'' said the new study offered a valuable quantitative analysis of a major development: Europe's ''civilizing process,'' in which violence was increasingly deemed unworthy of respectable citizens. Formerly, ''cultures of honor'' had valued violence as an appropriate response to insults and offenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Old Bailey archive was digitized a decade ago into a free and searchable database (oldbaileyonline.org) in which every defendant's name is tagged by gender, crime, location, the victim's name and address, verdict, and any punishment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that information, along with the trial transcripts, constitutes a trove so vast that no one can hold it all in mind -- a classic ''big data'' problem. ''What happens when we inflict harm on each other is the most interesting question of criminal law,'' Dr. DeDeo said, ''but the volume of data coming out the system is incomprehensible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter computers, in which words can be represented as mathematical objects and put through algorithms that can discern patterns invisible to a human brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a little bit like the big-sky surveys in astronomy,'' said Dr. DeDeo, who trained in astrophysics before turning to computer science. ''Instead of looking at individually interesting galaxies, we could look at hundreds of thousands of galaxies to change our scope of vision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the big data of the cosmos, he said, the Old Bailey proceedings contain ''the dark matter of bureaucracy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find patterns, the scientists looked at when and how often certain words occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Say you walk into a trial in 1750 and pick out one word,'' Dr. DeDeo said. ''How much can you learn about what the trial is about? If you hear the word 'kick,' you might associate it with violence, but you could not be certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But by 1850, if you hear the word 'kick,' you would know a lot about what the bureaucracy was going to do,'' he continued. ''With the passage of time, each word carries more information based on accumulating trial data. And this is what we can quantify.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To simplify their task, the researchers turned to the 1911 edition of Roget's Thesaurus, which sorts 26,000 distinct English words into 1,040 numbered categories called synonym sets. For example, words involving love and affection are in the high 800s, money and wealth in the low 800s. ''Kick,'' as in striking a blow, is No. 276, while killing is No. 361.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The beauty of this,'' Dr. DeDeo said, ''is that for every word we have a number that equates with a meaning'' that can be modeled mathematically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key finding is the gradual criminalization of violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1700s, violence was considered routine. A trial about theft, Dr. DeDeo said, might include testimony ''in which people gouge out each other's eyes, are covered in blood and get killed.'' But by the 1820s, the justice system was focused more on containing violence -- a development reflected not just in language but also in the professionalization of the justice system. ''The changes occurred under the radar,'' said Dr. Hitchcock, the British historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such change revealed by the study is that trial records became medicalized. In the mid-19th century, doctors start showing up in large numbers to give evidence and evaluate causes of death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, the transcripts have more superlatives and intensifiers -- words like ''very,'' ''so much,'' ''most'' -- in reference to acts of violence. Exaggeration is normal in a courtroom, but violence brings out more hyperbole; if someone steals your wallet, you are upset, but if someone beats you up, you are likely to use stronger language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Old Bailey transcripts ended in 1913 as publication costs grew prohibitive and newspapers took over the role of covering trials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysis of that coverage, Dr. DeDeo said, may shed light on how society's attitudes toward violence evolved over the 20th century, notable both for its wars and mayhem and for the easing of punishments like the death penalty, which has not been carried out in Britain since 1964.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seemed destined to pass without fanfare, except for a slight chance of slamming into the moon, and then loop aimlessly through the inner solar system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, a shoestring group of civilians headquartered in a decommissioned <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> have reached out and made contact with it -- a long-distance handshake that was the first step toward snaring it back into Earth's orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The zombie spaceship is coming home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 36 years in space, the craft, the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, appears to be in good working order. The main challenge, the engineers say, is figuring out how to command it. No one has the full operating manual anymore, and the fragments are sometimes contradictory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We call ourselves techno-archaeologists,'' said Dennis Wingo, an engineer and entrepreneur who has a track record of extracting miracles from space antiques that NASA has given up on. Mr. Wingo's company, Skycorp, has its offices in the <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> that used to serve the <span class="companylink">Navy</span>'s Moffett air station, 15 minutes northwest of San Jose, Calif. After the base closed, NASA converted it to a research campus for small technology companies, academia and nonprofits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo took on the project as if it were a stray puppy. ''No one else was going to do it,'' he said, ''and it seemed like the right thing to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The race to revive the craft, ISEE-3, began in earnest in April. At the end of May, using the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope in Puerto Rico, the team succeeded in talking to the spacecraft, a moment Mr. Wingo described as ''way cool.'' This made Skycorp the first private organization to command a spacecraft outside Earth orbit, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the obstacles, progress has been steady, and Mr. Wingo said the team should be ready to fire the engines within weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA launched ISEE-3 in 1978. Jimmy Carter was president, the Commodores topped the music charts with ''Three Times a Lady,'' and the No. 1 movie was ''Grease,'' starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. The craft orbited the sun between the sun and the Earth, allowing scientists to observe for the first time the high-speed stream of electrons and protons known as the solar wind before it reached Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then ISEE-3 was recruited to a different mission. With a serpentine do-si-do around the moon and Earth, it was aimed at Comet Giacobini-Zinner, passing through the tail in September 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA used ISEE-3 for a few more observations of interplanetary space before retiring it in 1997. Since then, the craft has been looping around the sun on a 355-day orbit. Like a faster racecar lapping the rest of the field, ISEE-3 will catch up to and pass Earth in two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is exactly what Robert W. Farquhar, the craft's flight director, intended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Farquhar, known for devising clever ways to move a spacecraft from Point A to Point B, came up with the intricate orbits that moved ISEE-3 to various locations in the solar wind, and then with the idea of using ISEE-3 to visit Giacobini-Zinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That angered the solar scientists, who accused him of stealing their spacecraft. But Dr. Farquhar won the support of NASA leaders. He also said he was just borrowing the craft and would return it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the successful Giacobini-Zinner flyby, ISEE-3 still had ample fuel, so three rocket burns in 1986 set it on a course to zoom about 30 miles above the surface of the moon 28 years later, on Aug. 10, 2014. The gravitational pull of the lunar flyby would swing ISEE-3 into orbit around Earth. Dr. Farquhar suggested that a space shuttle could bring it to the ground. NASA even signed an agreement to donate the craft to the <span class="companylink">National Air and Space Museum</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of NASA, however, was not looking that far ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, the agency upgraded its Deep Space Network, the system of radio telescopes that communicates with distant space probes. The old transmitters that could talk with ISEE-3 were thrown away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ISEE-3 was never turned off, so while Earth lost its ability to talk to it, ISEE-3 was still broadcasting, waiting for its next command.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the Deep Space Network listened briefly at the faraway spot where ISEE-3 was and heard the carrier frequency of the spacecraft's radio -- essentially a dial tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, NASA looked into reviving contact for the 2014 flyby, but concluded that the scientific payoff would not be worth the effort and money. Fans of the old spacecraft persisted, arguing that it could be used to train future scientists and engineers. But in February, Leonard N. Garcia, a NASA employee who had set up a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page promoting ISEE-3, conceded that it was not going to happen. New transmitters could be built, he wrote, ''but it would be at a price no one is willing to spend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That caught Mr. Wingo's attention. ''Not only is it not impossible,'' he said, ''I think it can work, and I know how to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo and Keith Cowing, the editor of NASA Watch, a sometimes cantankerous website covering news and gossip about the space agency, had previously collaborated on a project that resurrected equipment to read 50-year-old magnetic tapes, extracting high-resolution images taken by NASA lunar orbiters in the 1960s -- a task NASA had also regarded as infeasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo and Mr. Cowing decided ISEE-3 was another worthy effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 20 others scattered around the country joined the effort, including many members of the original ISEE-3 team. On RocketHub, a crowdfunding website, they asked for $125,000 to help pay the costs. They collected nearly $160,000, from 2,238 donors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they signed an agreement with NASA. Recent advances in what are called software-designed radios allowed the team to build a new transmitter and install it on the Arecibo telescope within a few weeks, much more quickly and cheaply than would have been possible a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wingo has now persuaded NASA to use the Deep Space Network to pinpoint ISEE-3's trajectory, to calculate the rocket burn required to put it on a path to Earth orbit. Dr. Farquhar's 1986 calculations were close, but not exact. Slight errors are magnified over time, and now the uncertainty is 20,000 miles, which means the spacecraft could be on course to splat into the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is in the agency's best interest to find out, one way or the other,'' Mr. Wingo said. If everything goes as hoped, ISEE-3 will end up in its original location to observe solar wind, fulfilling Dr. Farquhar's promise to return the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now 81, Dr. Farquhar is half-retired but collaborating with the reboot effort, and he is still thinking ahead. He wants to send ISEE-3 out to visit yet another comet. Mr. Wingo protests that it would cost too much money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll go to the comet,'' Dr. Farquhar said. ''Trust me.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the triumph of the moon landings more than four decades ago, presidents have made grand pronouncements about the next adventure for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronauts, one that would culminate with humans on Mars. But each time, those ambitions faded, unfulfilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a panel of experts is warning that the same fate may be in store for President Obama's declaration that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> astronauts would reach Mars in the 2030s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 285-page review of the human spaceflight program, the experts, convened by the National Research Council at the request of Congress, found that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> had not detailed a viable strategy for getting there and that its budgets were too small to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is not a believable plan for getting there in a finite period of time,'' said Jonathan I. Lunine, a Cornell astronomer and a co-chairman of the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel recommended that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> set specific intermediate milestones -- what it called ''steppingstones'' -- on the way to Mars, which it said would help solidify public and political support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the moment, there is little consensus about what <span class="companylink">NASA</span> should do after it completes its current project to develop a heavy-lift rocket to carry equipment for deep-space missions, with a first, unmanned launching scheduled in 2017 and a second launching, with astronauts, in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has proposed a robotic mission that would capture a small asteroid and transport it to an orbit high above the moon, where it would be easier for astronauts to reach and study. The robotic spacecraft would also test technologies like electric propulsion systems that could be used for a Mars mission. Then a crew of astronauts would rendezvous with the asteroid to examine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some in Congress have pushed for <span class="companylink">NASA</span> to instead head back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even during the 1960s, as <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was putting together the Apollo moon missions, the public viewed human spaceflight positively, but was not overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Only after the successful landing of Apollo 11 in July 1969 did public approval swing very high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lunine said that with steppingstones, people would look back positively at what had already been accomplished and be more likely to continue supporting a Mars program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel did not recommend a best path to Mars, but it evaluated three possibilities. One would follow the asteroid mission with astronauts visiting Phobos and Deimos, Mars's moons, before landing on Mars itself. A second approach would send astronauts for a stay on Earth's moon, providing a place to test humans' ability to live on a hostile surface. The third would in effect combine the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said the moon path would provide more technologies that could be applied to Mars than the asteroid route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Williams, deputy associate administrator for policy and plans in <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s human exploration and operations mission directorate, said the agency would evaluate options over the summer and a more detailed strategy could begin to emerge by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said that a clearer strategy would also be helpful in guiding <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s investments in research and development. If some critical technologies are to be ready in two decades, it continued, work on them needed to begin right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lunine was supportive of a <span class="companylink">NASA</span> project in Hawaii to develop ways to land bigger spacecraft on Mars. A test, originally scheduled for last week, has been repeatedly postponed because of weather, but it could get off the ground this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For robotic probes like the Mars Curiosity rover, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> has employed parachutes, rocket engines, air bags and an elaborate winch system. But Curiosity is only the size of a car; those methods would fail for something much larger and heavier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s project, the Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator, a saucer-shaped vehicle, will be lifted by helium balloon to 120,000 feet, before a rocket engine propels it to nearly four times the speed of sound at 180,000 feet, the stratosphere providing conditions similar to those entering the Martian atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will then inflate like a puffer fish to a bigger disk 20 feet wide, providing a bigger atmospheric brake. ''This is the kind of research that <span class="companylink">NASA</span> should be doing more of,'' Dr. Lunine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he questioned the value of a prototype lunar lander called Morpheus, currently being tested at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida, because <span class="companylink">NASA</span> currently has no plans to land on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is exactly the kind of problem that occurs without a pathway approach to human space exploration,'' Dr. Lunine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the panel said <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s annual budget -- $17.5 billion, a figure that is expected to remain roughly the same in coming years -- was insufficient to pay for such an ambitious endeavor. The criticism echoes a common admonition of spaceflight advocates: ''No bucks, no Buck Rogers.'' Just allowing spending to rise at 2.5 percent a year to offset inflation would open possibilities, the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Research Council report is unlikely to resolve disagreements over the direction of <span class="companylink">NASA</span>, undercutting another of its conclusions: To succeed, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> needs a consensus commitment from political leaders stretching over two or three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the impasse between the Obama administration's advocacy of the asteroid mission and those pushing for the moon in Congress could continue until the next president takes office in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that is highly likely,'' said John M. Logsdon, a former director of the Space Policy Institute at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span>. ''Verging on certain.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They died as they slipped the surly bonds of Earth. The last words of that sentence, haunting words, were written by John Gillespie Magee Jr., an American airman and poet who enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. He was killed the following year in a midair collision over England. He was all of 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poets can achieve immortality; Magee did with a sonnet called ''High Flight.'' Its opening and closing lines became embedded in the American consciousness when President Ronald Reagan invoked them in paying tribute to the seven Americans who died in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986. Those men and women, the president said in an address to a stunned and grieving nation, had ''slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this finale of its current series of documentary videos, Retro Report remains true to its mission of re-examining past news stories by summoning the heartache of that day in 1986 and also of another, 17 years later: the disaster that killed the seven crew members of the space shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1, 2003. Time can be the enemy of memory. But it is not too late, with Memorial Day behind us by mere days, to recall those who soared so high, only to fall back to Earth. On the Challenger, they were Francis R. Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Ronald E. McNair, Ellison S. Onizuka, Judith A. Resnik, Gregory B. Jarvis and, best-known of all, the schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. The Columbia crew members were Rick D. Husband, William C. McCool, Michael P. Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, David M. Brown, Laurel S. Clark and Ilan Ramon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space shuttling under the aegis of the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> belongs to the past, at least for now. Atlantis flew the last mission, three years ago. These days, Americans headed to the International Space Station have to hitch a ride on a Russian craft -- with the United States government paying handsomely for the privilege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one can be sure if this arrangement will endure. Tensions over events in Ukraine have strained relations between Washington and Moscow to the point that a Russian deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin, said recently that American astronauts might be denied access to Russian launch vehicles. Americans want to go to the space station? Let them do it ''using a trampoline,'' Mr. Rogozin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 30 years, there were 135 American shuttle launches and returns, and 133 were successes. Perhaps inevitably, it is the other two that people remember best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those missions turned into catastrophes for different reasons. On Challenger, an O-ring seal failed on a rocket booster, causing a breach that let loose a stream of hot gas, which ignited an external fuel tank; 73 seconds after liftoff, the shuttle broke apart over the Atlantic. With Columbia, a piece of insulating foam broke off from an external tank during the launch, and struck the left wing. The damage proved severe enough that when the craft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after two weeks in space, hot atmospheric gases were able to penetrate the wing structure. The shuttle became unstable. It broke apart over Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two disasters led to investigations, to the removal of senior officials, to promises of institutional change, to undying expressions of sorrow. Among the remorseful were engineers who had warned that headaches like eroded O rings and missing foam created risks, but who could not persuade their immediate superiors to act. One former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> engineer, Rodney Rocha, lamented to Retro Report that he wished he had been more aggressive in making his concerns known to those at the very top. Observing the chain of command looms large in the world of engineering, Mr. Rocha said, adding, ''I will regret, always, why I didn't break down the door by myself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theorizing about what went wrong in these two disasters and in others, some social scientists have observed that certain circumstances may well be beyond anyone's control. Even before Challenger, in 1984, a sociologist named Charles Perrow put forth the concept of ''normal accidents,'' by which he meant that in a technologically complex operation something is bound to go wrong at some point. These systems are made up of so many tightly linked parts, Mr. Perrow said, that even a seemingly minor glitch could lead to a cascade of woes that make cosmic failure almost unavoidable. An example for him was the near-meltdown in 1979 at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sociologist, Diane Vaughan, has written extensively about Challenger and served on the commission that investigated the Columbia horror. She has advanced the theory of ''normalization of deviance,'' meaning that in many organizations -- <span class="companylink">NASA</span> certainly being no exception -- some problems and risks are understood to be acceptable -- part of doing business, if you will. Take those problematic O rings on Challenger. Their erosion had been evident on earlier launchings, but flying with them became routine. To Ms. Vaughan, <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s decision to forge ahead on that fateful January day in 1986, despite new concerns about the O rings that were raised, did not reflect cold, bottom-line thinking or an amoral bending of rules. ''They applied all the usual rules,'' she told Retro Report. Regrettably, they did so ''in a situation where the usual rules didn't apply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theories of this sort can conceivably touch on other calamities. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico might be one example. Another could be the recent South Korean ferry disaster in which several hundred people died, most of them high school students. Setting aside possibly criminal conduct by senior officers who abandoned ship, reports out of South Korea suggest that safety failings had long been accepted as routine: normalized deviance, which included excessive overloading of cargo onto the ferry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when a system is not technologically complex, a tiny defect can lead to calamity. This is not a new thought. Perhaps the tragedies of Challenger and Columbia, seemingly rooted in relatively minor problems, were ordained by a concept that has been around for centuries. It has something to do with what can happen for want of a nail.</p>

Frost, the chief herpetology curator at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, has done fieldwork in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Mexico, Namibia, Peru, South Africa and Vietnam. He is also a sort of gatekeeper for amphibians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Frost, 62, oversees the museum's catalog of the class Amphibia -- more than 7,200 species, comprising frogs, salamanders and limbless, soil-dwelling caecilians. Its web page attracts more than a million views a year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An avuncular conversationalist who enjoys a laugh -- a good thing, given the perilous state of amphibians on the planet -- he also keeps two roaming tortoises (amphibian reptiles) in a room next to his office; the larger is a 100-pound, 15-year-old African tortoise named Mud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We spoke for four hours. What follows is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE AMPHIBIANS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, frogs, for example, are extraordinary and come across to people as gentle and benign. There are frogs as small as a house fly, yet some are 13 inches long, weighing seven pounds. Some water frogs can jump more than 10 feet. They can live 20 years or more -- and some tortoises can live to be 200. Frogs existed at least 200 million years ago, well before the asteroid strike that caused nuclear winter and killed the dinosaurs. Still, the frogs survived -- how, is anybody's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FROGS AND TOADS HAVE ALSO BEEN POPULAR FICTIONAL CHARACTERS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, like Kermit the Frog. It's pretty clear that he's an American green frog. And Toad, of Toad Hall? Well, he could drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT'S THE LATEST FROG MATH?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-eight percent of amphibians are frogs, and we know of 6,339 species, substantially more than all mammals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY DO AMPHIBIANS SERVE AS BIOLOGICAL BAROMETERS FOR LIFE ON EARTH?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're very sensitive to any perturbation in their environment. And they're similar to us -- they have moist, permeable skins, and so do we. And they are particularly vulnerable to airborne and waterborne toxins: funguses, acid rain, heavy metals, herbicides and other pollutants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK ''AMPHIBIAN SPECIES OF THE WORLD.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a global sourcebook for people working in the science of biodiversity, and it's become a tool for conservationists, policy makers, wildlife regulators and forestry, customs and enforcement officials. The catalog before it was published in 1882, identifying 800 amphibian species. Our 1985 catalog identified 4,014 species. Once, there was little worldwide access to the amphibian literature. Currently, it's online, it's got 20,000 pages, and we count more than 7,200 species. We used to update the catalog once a year to reflect new findings. Now it is updated almost every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IS THE NUMBER OF SPECIES GROWING, WHEN AMPHIBIANS ARE IN DECLINE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 150 new species are being named each year, because collectors can get into more places to discover them. The rapid discovery of new species involves new techniques, like molecular assaying. But it is also the flip side of habitat destruction. Roads and associated development allow you to get into areas easily, to discover things that were previously unreachable, but these opened-up habitats are also increasingly inhospitable to wildlife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many amphibian species have gone extinct in the last 30 years, and many more are threatened. In 1975, a colleague and I observed a major die-off of Tarahumara frogs in the mountains to the west of Nogales, Ariz. Most were dead; all of the others were in big trouble. That haunts me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We thought at the time that it was acid rain that got them, but they were knocked out by the chytridiomycosis fungus, which digests the frogs' skin -- and it burns them. It's really terrible for them and is a scourge that has damaged frog populations and caused extinctions worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1979, in the mountains of Guatemala, we observed hundreds and hundreds of breeding frogs at one site. But we've never seen them there again. That's a shocking and strange thing, to have observed something that's never going to be seen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My great-grandmother saw wild bison on the plains of Wyoming. No one will ever see that again. I saw native populations of Tarahumara frogs in Arizona. No one will ever see that again, either. It is not a good feeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IS THAT THREE-FOOT-LONG TAXONOMY TREE FRAMED ON YOUR OFFICE WALL?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We did a very large DNA analysis to establish the evolutionary tree of amphibians, and after two years of work we published that in 2006. In doing so, we pushed the whole biological community to come to grips with the phylogenetic classifications that we identified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, eight years later, people are still debating it, but in that time the supercomputers that do the analysis are 10 times faster, so it would be interesting to redo it and push the data even harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAS DNA RESEARCH CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW AMPHIBIAN SPECIES?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that people were unprepared for the kind of diversity that exists worldwide, and especially in tropical Asia and Indonesia, until molecular data made it impossible to overlook. There is an enormous amount of previously unassessed diversity, much of it being lost before we even know what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASIDE FROM YOUR FIELD RESEARCH, DO YOU GET OUT OF THE LAB?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've identified specimens for enforcement people at Kennedy Airport. For example, an importer claimed it had legal frogs from the Philippines, for frogs' legs. But they weren't. They were actually protected frogs, likely from India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOUR ATTACHMENT TO THE TORTOISES IN THE NEXT OFFICE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tortoises have a calming effect. They remind you of what it is you do. They are friendly -- it's like having a big dog -- but their personalities are a lot like cats. And they may look slow-moving, but from six feet away they can come at you before you can get out of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY DID YOU BECOME A HERPETOLOGIST?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I grew up in southern Arizona, a great place to become a biologist -- 12 species of rattlesnakes and great biodiversity, including horned lizards in my grandparents' backyard. When I was 4, my parents were driving us out to Yuma to visit my great-aunt, and we stopped at a park along the way. I began wandering around, and I saw a baby rattlesnake at the base of a tree. I thought it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I excitedly told my father about it. He came over and pounded it with a tire iron. I was sorry I said anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once, I lost a mountain kingsnake in our house. It was suddenly rediscovered when it fell out of the kitchen cabinet on my mom's head!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DESPITE THAT, YOU KEPT COLLECTING?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery is what it is all about. My interests have focused on some of the more technical aspects of science, but discovering the diversity of life is what matters, whether in the lab or in the field. And, I suppose, being faithful to my roots. I still keep three snakes in my office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm still a herper and a snaker -- someone really fascinated with snakes and lizards, turtles and amphibians. It's sobering, though, to realize that most of the frogs I saw as a child are now extinct in Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAN MONITORING DECLINING SPECIES BE DEPRESSING?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes and no. I am fascinated by life, but I don't enjoy seeing so much just slipping away. Every generation thinks that now is normal. It isn't. But I'm glad I am the age I am. I have seen things no one will see again and I have loved doing it. But I see things happening now on the planet that will not end well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY DO YOU SAY YOU'RE GLAD?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because I won't be around.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centuries from now, a large swath of the West Antarctic ice sheet is likely to be gone, its hundreds of trillions of tons of ice melted, causing a four-foot rise in already swollen seas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists reported last week that the scenario may be inevitable, with new research concluding that some giant glaciers had passed the point of no return, possibly setting off a chain reaction that could doom the rest of the ice sheet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, the research signaled that changes in the earth's climate have already reached a tipping point, even if global warming halted immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We as people see it as closing doors and limiting our future choices,'' said Richard Alley, a professor of geosciences at <span class="companylink">Pennsylvania State University</span>. ''Most of us personally like to keep those choices open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these glaciers are just the latest signs that the thawing of earth's icy regions is accelerating. While some glaciers are holding steady or even growing slightly, most are shrinking, and scientists believe they will continue to melt until greenhouse gas emissions are reined in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's possibly the best evidence of real global impact of warming,'' said Theodore A. Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthest along in melting are the smallest glaciers in the high mountainous regions of the Andes, the Alps and the Himalayas and in Alaska. By itself, their melting does not pose a grave threat; together they make up only 1 percent of the ice on the planet and would cause sea level to rise only by one to two feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mountain glaciers have been telling scientists what the West Antarctica glacier disintegration is now confirming: In the coming centuries, more land will be covered by water and more of nature will be disrupted. A full melt would cause sea level to rise 215 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During recent ice ages, glaciers expanded from the poles and covered nearly a third of the continents. And in the distant past there were episodes known as Snowball Earth, when the entire planet froze over. At the other extreme, a warm period near the end of the age of dinosaurs may have left the earth ice-free. Today the amount of ice is modest -- 10 percent of land areas, nearly all of that in Greenland and Antarctica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glaciers are, simply, rivers of ice formed from snow in regions that are frozen year-round. The snow compacts over time into granular, porous ice, which glaciologists call firn. When firn compacts even more, it becomes glacier ice, which flows, usually slowly, down mountainsides. Depending on how fast new snow accumulates at the top, or melts at the bottom, a glacier grows or shrinks in length and thickness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, the only way to measure glaciers was to put stakes in the ice. Using surveying tools, glaciologists would mark the location and return later to see how far the ice had moved. The method gave scientists a sense of only the areas measured during that study period. ''We had these point measurements which were very labor-intensive,'' said Tad Pfeffer, a glaciologist at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, satellites provide a global view. Images show where the glaciers are and how areas change over the years. Most useful has been NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or Grace. Two identical spacecraft have been measuring the earth's gravity. When glaciers melt, the water flows elsewhere, and that part of the planet weighs less, slightly weakening its gravitational pull. Grace isn't precise enough to measure the mass changes in an individual glacier, but it does provide data on regional shifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another NASA satellite, IceSat, bounced lasers off the ice to precisely measure glaciers' height. (In operation from 2003 through 2009, when the last of its lasers stopped working, it is scheduled to be replaced by IceSat-2 in 2017.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis last year of the satellite and ground measurements, a team of scientists led by Alex S. Gardner, an earth scientist at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., who is moving to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, concluded that, on average, glaciers in all regions were withering away, dumping 260 billion metric tons of water into the ocean every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't think of any major glacier region that's growing right now,'' Dr. Scambos said. ''Almost everywhere we look we're seeing mass loss.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The melting from the mountain glaciers alone raises sea level about 0.7 millimeters a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland together possess about 100 times as much ice as all of the mountain glaciers combined, but contribute only slightly more to the sea level rise: 310 billion tons a year, Dr. Scambos said. That is because most of the mountain glaciers lie in areas where temperatures are closer to the melting point than they are in Greenland or Antarctica, and so slight warming tips them to melting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenland, with 10 percent of the world's ice, has enough to raise sea level by 23 feet. ''I still think Greenland is the most important thing to watch for this century,'' Dr. Scambos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, when summer Arctic temperatures were particularly warm, surface melting was observed almost everywhere on Greenland's glaciers, even in the mountains. That had not happened for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers from Dartmouth found that another side effect from global warming, forest fires, made the melting even worse. Soot from fires elsewhere in the world landed on Greenland snow, making it darker, causing it to absorb more heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study of Greenland, published Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience, paints an even bleaker picture. The melting is accelerated because many of the glaciers flow in the warming waters around Greenland. However, scientists had believed that the melting would slow once the bottom of the glaciers melted and they were no longer touching the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new research indicates otherwise. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, including Eric Rignot, the lead author of one of last week's papers concluding that the melt in West Antarctica is irreversible, discovered long, deep canyons below sea level and under the ice sheet. So even as the glaciers retreat, they will still be in contact with the encroaching warm water, and as a result, more ice will melt. ''They will contribute more to sea level rise,'' said Mathieu Morlighem, lead author of the Nature Geoscience paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antarctica is the largest frozen mass on the planet, accounting for about 90 percent of the earth's ice. Most of it is in East Antarctica, which is generally higher and colder and less likely to melt. By some estimates global warming is leading to increased snowfall there, which is limiting the loss. But as in West Antarctica, some of the ice resides in bowl-shape depressions, which are similarly vulnerable to melting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, data from the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s CryoSat satellite, published on Monday, indicates that the continent shed 160 billion tons a year from 2010 to 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say that the melting will continue as long as the heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. Even if carbon dioxide and temperatures stabilize, the melting and shifting of glaciers will continue for decades or centuries as they adjust to the new equilibrium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a vast majority of the ice is not yet destined to melt. ''We have not committed to a lot more that could be committed if we keep turning up the thermostat,'' said Dr. Alley of Penn State.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An area rug with geometric shapes and yellow rings suggestive of planetary orbits covered the floor. A photograph of the Milky Way rising over the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea hung on one wall. A Naugahyde couch ran along one side of the room. Opposite it was a small refrigerator with a stash of Grape-Nuts and soy milk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the lair of Geoffrey W. Marcy, holder of the Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence and, outside a certain robot spacecraft named Kepler, the most prolific American discoverer of alien worlds, so-called exoplanets circling stars beyond the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An August evening found Dr. Marcy, a gray-goateed, twinkly-eyed presence with an aggressively empathetic air, crouched as usual in a corner in an old wooden desk chair. In front of him were computer screens and a video display connecting him to Mauna Kea, home of the twin Keck telescopes, at 40 feet in diameter the two largest in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He clicked an icon on one of his screens. Three thousand miles west and 14,000 feet up, a glass container about the shape and size of a tuna can slid into place in the beam of the Keck I telescope, interposing a calibrating layer of iodine gas between it and the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was farther away, he noted, than the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queued up for observation from Mauna Kea that night were a few dozen of the most promising objects yet found by NASA's vaunted planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are earths,'' Dr. Marcy said, gesturing to the screens. ''All my life I've pointed telescopes at stars not knowing if planets were there or not. Now we know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humanity, he said, had arrived at a special but bittersweet moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For thousands of years, people had looked up at the night sky wondering whether they were alone in these starry depths, whether there was any place like Earth out there, and how they would ever know. Only 20 years ago, the notion of other worlds and other life was dismissed as science fiction in respectable academic circles. Now astronomers have evidence that there are more planets than stars out there, a billion chances for Darwin, a billion potential real estate deals, a billion sci-fi dreams come true -- a signature shift in cosmic perspective, in which Dr. Marcy played a leading role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues were on the verge of being able to say how common Earthlike worlds were in the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy was being mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler had broken down after four years of planet-hunting glory, and plans had collapsed for a grand, much-promoted space mission known as the Terrestrial Planet Finder, which could produce images of distant planets, sniff their atmospheres and perhaps map their geography to determine whether they were habitable or inhabited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The field, he feared, was approaching a lull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What are we going to do when we've squeezed the last drop from Kepler?'' Dr. Marcy asked. ''A side of me is already grieving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic Dreams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The road to the math building basement had been bumpy and long, and Dr. Marcy had the emotional bruises to show for it. He was born 59 years ago in St. Clair Shores, Mich., and had what he called a ''plain vanilla'' upbringing in the San Fernando Valley, imbued with a love of sports and space. Carl Sagan, the Cornell astronomer, best-selling author and host of the PBS series ''Cosmos,'' was his hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attended U.C.L.A. and then the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he earned a Ph.D. using spectroscopic measurements to study magnetic fields in stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the starry road almost ended shortly after that. Dr. Marcy won a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship to continue his magnetic research at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, Calif., where he would be using the same telescope with which Edwin Hubble had discovered the expansion of the universe in 1929.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Marcy's measurements didn't work and his previous results came under fire from other astronomers. ''I got really hammered in Pasadena,'' he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was devastated. He felt stupid and ill judged. ''I was so obviously a fraud,'' he recalled thinking. He consulted a psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wondered if he was suicidal. Then he wondered how he would know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A turning point, he said, came while he was in the shower one morning in 1983, contemplating the end of his astronomy career. He decided that if he was going down in flames, he would go down doing something he believed in. He vowed to spend the rest of his career hunting for life in the universe. That meant searching for planets around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need planets,'' he said. ''That stands at the nexus. The logical platform for life is a planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time he got out of the shower, his fingers were all wrinkled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never forgotten how miserable I was in that shower,'' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Fire in the Belly</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When his fellowship was up in 1983, Dr. Marcy took a job teaching at San Francisco State University, far from the research limelight -- it had no Ph.D. program. In his spare time, between teaching and fixing the telescope on the roof of the science building, he assembled a team of students to work on how to find planets around other stars -- if they were out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his students was Mario Savio, formerly the firebrand leader of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley in the '60s. In his office, Dr. Marcy keeps a picture of Mr. Savio, who went on to teach physics at Sonoma State and died in 1996, at 53. He was brilliant, Dr. Marcy recalled, but ''he hated writing computer code.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big break came when a graduate student, R. Paul Butler, who had just received an undergraduate chemistry degree, showed up in his office in the fall of 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recipe for finding planets had been laid out by the eminent astronomer Otto Struve in 1952. He pointed out that a planet would give its home star a small gravitational kick, inducing a wobble into the star's motion as seen from Earth. In principle this could be detected by slight shifts in the wavelengths of light from the star, like the Doppler shift that causes the pitch of an ambulance siren to change as it goes past. But it required a spectrograph that could detect the shifts of one part in 10 million to see something like Jupiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy's new graduate student had ''fire in his belly,'' he recalled, and he put him to work finding a way to make a spectrograph sensitive enough to do the job. At Mount Wilson, Dr. Marcy already knew, solar astronomers calibrated their spectrographs by passing sunlight through iodine, which absorbs light at particular wavelengths, producing dark lines like the gaps in a picket fence that can serve as reference points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After considering other ideas, he and Mr. Butler settled on iodine to calibrate their own machine. Mr. Butler built a cell to hold iodine, and in 1987 they installed it on the Shane three-meter telescope at the university's Lick Observatory, outside San Jose, and began looking at stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took them eight years to refine their techniques to find a planet. Wavelength shifts could be easily blurred, for example, by changes in the atmosphere from night to night or even moment to moment. The same effects that make stars twinkle could make their planets indistinguishable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were we struggling without any road map,'' said Dr. Butler, who earned a Ph.D. from the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> in the process and is now at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> in Washington. ''Nobody knew who we were. The few people who knew what we were trying to do also knew that our quest was quixotic at best, and more likely just flat out laughable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natalie Batalha, then a student at Berkeley and now a leader on the Kepler project, agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy, she said, ''was a San Francisco State professor, hanging around Berkeley working on a program nobody had confidence that it would come to anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Like Being on Columbus's Ship'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when they were getting good at searching, Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler were scooped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall of 1995, using the same wobble technique, a team led by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, of the University of Geneva, found a planet roughly half the mass of Jupiter, circling the star 51 Pegasi, about 50 light-years away, in only four days -- way inside of where Mercury orbits our sun. That was a major surprise. Jupiter takes 12 years to orbit the sun, and astronomers had presumed that other planetary systems would be structured like our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler dashed up to Lick Observatory and confirmed the new planet. They came down the mountain elated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It felt like being on Columbus's ship,'' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their own time came a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on the morning of Dec. 30, Dr. Marcy and his wife, Susan Kegley, were getting the house ready for a New Year's Eve party, when Dr. Butler called, summoning him to the office. ''All he said was 'Geoff, get over here,' '' Dr. Marcy recalled later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a graph when he got there was the up-and-down velocity cycle of a giant planet orbiting the star 70 Virginis, about 60 light-years from here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the next two years they found 10 more planets, generating headlines but also bruising controversy, as if Dr. Marcy had never gotten out of that shower. Some prominent astronomers argued that the Marcy-Butler team was confusing starspots or double stars for planets. The systems they were discovering were too unlike our solar system to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For three or four years, nobody believed us,'' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point he was invited to give a talk at a prominent meeting in Houston, home of the Lunar and Planetary Institute. But when he got there he was ushered into a small room where half a dozen scientists interrogated him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sent me into a tailspin,'' Dr. Marcy said. ''I was back to feeling stupid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, in November 1999, Dr. Marcy's group and another team, led by David Charbonneau of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, more or less simultaneously detected the shadow of a planet crossing, or ''transiting,'' in front of a star that already had been seen to wobble. The combination of wobble and blink was impossible to explain as anything other than a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweet vindication at last? Perhaps, but Dr. Marcy still is quick to point out that the objections to his work were never retracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the critics, David Black, an astronomer at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, says there is no apologizing in science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was never personal, as he seems to think it was for some reason that I have never been able to figure out,'' Dr. Black said. ''I think Geoff deserves all of the credit and praise he has gotten for his work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strained Relationships</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the decade Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler, joined by Dr. Marcy's old mentor Steven Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Debra Fischer, now at Yale, found themselves in intense competition with Dr. Mayor's team, often referred to as ''the Swiss.'' The two groups leapfrogged each other, adding to the planet count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler were awarded the first Bioastronomy Medal of Honor by the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>, beginning an avalanche of medals and awards. Dr. Marcy was elected to the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> and was on David Letterman's show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting closer to answering the golden question of whether there is life out there,'' he said in 2004. ''We're trying to find our own roots, chemically and biologically, in the stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2005, he and Dr. Butler had found 107 planets. They were the Batman and Robin of astronomy. But as the partnership grew, strains developed, with Dr. Butler feeling increasingly marginalized as reporters flocked to the eloquent and emotionally available Dr. Marcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Butler was more brusque. When asked for a sound bite he was more likely to grumble that he was looking forward to more data. ''Some people want to be an astronomer, '' he said in an interview a few years ago. ''Other people just want to play one on TV.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matters grew tenser in 2005, when Dr. Marcy and Dr. Mayor were awarded a $1 million prize given annually by the late Hong Kong film mogul and philanthropist Run Run Shaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy didn't tell the rest of his team about the prize until he returned from Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was afraid it would cause the divorce it, in fact, caused,'' he said later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007 Dr. Vogt resigned from the team, saying he had lost confidence in Dr. Marcy's leadership. Dr. Butler soon followed. The real heroes in the exoplanet story, he wrote in an email, are the astronomers who build the instruments. ''In both my career and Geoff Marcy's career, the single most important person is Steve Vogt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewed recently, a clearly uncomfortable Dr. Marcy said he had been saddened but not surprised, comparing the rift to the breakup of the Beatles. ''I would never have left Paul and Steve,'' he said. ''They are family, period,''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is unapologetic about his own fame. ''The news media likes me,'' he said and added: ''I've been lucky. Professional astronomers know I've been in the basement.'' Dr. Marcy gave the bulk of his award to Cal-Santa Cruz and San Francisco State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Batalha, of the Kepler project, said the rivalries of the early days of the exoplanet hunt had taken their toll. ''It was a very intense competition,'' she said. ''It didn't have to be. Everybody was racing to be first.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divorce had major consequences for the Automated Planet Finder, a robot telescope that Dr. Vogt and Dr. Marcy had been planning to build at Lick Observatory but was delayed for years. ''In divorce, the kids are the telescopes,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy eventually agreed to split the time on the telescope with the team of Dr. Vogt and Dr. Butler. They drew straws to divide the 1,700 stars on their target list and 12 years of data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the end of the day you try to be honorable,'' Dr. Vogt said. It began operating this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Age of Kepler</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came Kepler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA spacecraft was launched in 2009 into an Earth-trailing orbit around the sun. Its mission was to stare at one patch of stars for four years looking for the periodic dimming that might signify planets passing in front of their suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grand goal was to find Earthlike planets. The fraction of stars with such planets is known as eta-Earth; it is a key factor in the so-called Drake Equation, used to calculate the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we ever have the ability to step out of our cosmic cocoon, the answer could help us decide whether there will be anywhere to go, and how far away the nearest habitable planet might be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or as William Borucki, who spent 20 years persuading NASA to take on the Kepler project, said, ''We provide the data mankind needs to move out into space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler shook the sky as if it were a tree. More than 1,000 possible planets fell out in the first year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy had been a member of Kepler's science team from the beginning, in 2001. But it was only in 2007, he said, that he finally had time to start going to the meetings. ''It changed my life by bringing Earth-size planets into view,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Geoff is a good guy,'' said Dr. Batalha, Kepler's deputy science director. She described him as a gracious team member, generous with credit and going out of his way to make younger astronomers feel valued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Kepler astronomers realized in 2012 that they would need more time than planned for their survey, Dr. Marcy put on his ''lucky underwear,'' as he put it, and went to NASA headquarters to argue for more time. ''This is for my students,'' he said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kepler's pointing system failed a year later, cutting short its planet quest, Dr. Marcy was theatrically despondent. Borrowing from a W. H Auden poem, he wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stop all the clocks, cut off the Internet,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let jet airplanes circle at night overhead,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skywriting over Cygnus: Kepler is dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Chicken Geoff'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy lives high in the Berkeley hills with Dr. Kegley, ''wife, chemist, goddess,'' as he puts it on his website -- an environmental chemist and chief executive of the consulting firm Pesticide Research Institute. Their backyard is home to beehives decorated with astronomical symbols, and a flock of chickens, leading the son of one of his graduate students to call him ''Chicken Geoff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social consciousness is part of his identity. At Santa Cruz he ran around plastering ''Men Against Rape'' stickers over nude pinups in the engineering and optics shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Berkeley he regularly hits the tennis courts with the women's team. ''They give me lessons,'' he said. Perhaps reflecting his own years of self-doubt, his website also has a section on depression and suicide awareness. ''Now I know I wasn't alone,'' he said of those dark days in Pasadena. ''It's a common phenomenon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once an outsider with no future, Dr. Marcy now has his pick of collaborators and students. ''My undergraduates are even smarter than my graduate students,'' he said recently. He has also embraced the freedom to be outspoken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a meeting at M.I.T. in 2011, he startled his colleagues with a bitter tirade about their collective failure to win approval for the Terrestrial Planet Finder and challenged President Obama to make a Kennedyesque declaration that we would send a probe to Alpha Centauri. That mission would revive the agency and maybe the nation, which he says has been squandering its technological leadership in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every young person is wondering, 'What will my generation do that my parents didn't do?' '' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His former student Andrew W. Howard, now at the University of Hawaii, said Dr. Marcy had the ability to see the big picture and what to do next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He tries to zero in on the right answer,'' he said. ''He's not concentrated on little details.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This tendency was in play last fall when Erik Petigura, another of Dr. Marcy's graduate students, announced, based on his own analysis of Kepler data, that about a fifth of the 100 billion sunlike stars in the galaxy had potentially habitable Earth-size planets. In effect he had beaten the Kepler team to the first estimate of the all-important eta-Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Dr. Marcy's direction, Mr. Petigura had spent the previous two years building and testing his own version of the computer pipeline by which Kepler data was analyzed. ''Learning the occurrence of Earthlike planets can be done only once,'' Dr. Marcy told him. ''Erik, you're the one; you can sleep later.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement overshadowed a major exoplanet meeting at NASA's Ames Research Center, even as astronomers agreed that it was only the first of what would be many tries at getting eta-Earth right. Mr. Petigura's analysis was full of assumptions and extrapolations that would be tested and retested in the coming years, astronomers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Batalha, among others, pointed out, ''we don't yet have any planet candidates that are exact analogues of the Earth in terms of size, orbit or star type.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marcy nevertheless pronounced himself ''tingly,'' saying it was the most important work he had been involved in. The <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> recently named their paper as the best on the physical sciences published last year in The Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span>, giving it the Cozzarelli Prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stars of Summer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing Kepler couldn't do without outside help was to say what these putative planets were like. By recording those blinks, it could measure the sizes of planets, but not their masses and densities. Thus there was no way to know whether these worlds were bags of gas or rocks like Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was where Dr. Marcy came in, along with the Keck telescope array and its ability to measure wobbles and masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're pouring all our effort into planets roughly the size of Earth,'' Dr. Marcy said, ''not just discovering but measuring the properties of Earth-size planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Greeks would have enjoyed this,'' he added. ''They would understand. This is not quantum field theory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was particularly interested in learning at what size a planet went from being a rock with water on it, and possibly habitable like Earth, to being gas, like Neptune. The question was of more than academic interest, since most of the Kepler planets are between Earth and Neptune in size. The data seemed to suggest, he said, that the break-even point between rocky and gaseous was about one and a half times the size of Earth. Kepler has shown that there are plenty of such worlds out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But without the Terrestrial Planet Finder or something like it, the search for Earth 2.0 could go only so far. You could find a planet with the mass and orbit of Earth, he explained, but ''how do we know it's not an ocean world like Kevin Costner, or dry as a bone?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, astronomy was a romantic and physically grueling endeavor. Astronomers kissed their spouses and children goodbye and decamped for distant mountains, where they donned electrically heated flight suits to survive a frigid, nightlong telescope vigil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this night Dr. Marcy set up the telescope and its spectrometer with that tuna can of iodine, then headed home for a meal of wild salmon and tomatoes and figs from his backyard. Thus fortified, he returned to watch as Keck sent data from Hawaii to Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few hours, a rogue's gallery of stars, all of them home to suspected planets, swam into view, one after another. ''They are my children,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One screen showed a star's spectrum -- a picket fence of dark and light, depending on which wavelengths of light were there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another screen showed previous measurements of that star's velocity cycle as determined by earlier observations. Some looked like perfect sine waves, the signature of a star being jerked rhythmically back and forth by a planet; others were noisy clumps of points in which one could imagine regularity. Dr. Marcy provided color commentary as if he were checking up on old friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a star pulling on a star,'' he said as one came up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to a small wiggle on another curve that suggested a second planet where there was already one. ''This is frankly publishable now,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another star, an old friend known as 16 Cygni B came up with a saw-toothed pattern of motion, the signature of an egg-shaped orbit. He recalled that he and Dr. Butler had been in his office at 4 a.m. when they first saw it -- the fourth or fifth planet they had discovered -- ''and it's still interesting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look at this beauty,'' Dr. Marcy exclaimed. ''This is Isaac Newton screaming with joy from his grave.'' He continued with a chuckle: ''This is my life. When we saw this, we were so excited. People didn't realize planets could be in elliptical orbits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thought brought him back to the days of being criticized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It feels like a black and white movie to me, really a horror film,'' he said. ''I was really distressed with myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kepler taught us that planets are common. We didn't know that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Petigura's analysis was right, he said, the nearest Earthlike planets could be as close as 10 or 12 light-years away, within reach of a moderate-size telescope. ''If you do T.P.F., you will not come up empty.'' he said, referring to a Terrestrial Planet Finder. ''You'll have a handful of them. So we have our homework.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then the sky was getting cloudy in Hawaii. ''Bad news, but this is astronomy,'' Dr. Marcy said with a sigh as he went to look for bright stars that would punch through the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing about having a big telescope,'' he explained: ''We can collect a lot of light through clouds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was midnight when he moved on to the next star, one with five planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a great thing,'' he said. ''I love this.'' For him the night and the universe were young.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Virgin Galactic's first commercial flight accelerates to space carrying Richard Branson, the billionaire owner of the company, and his family, David Mackay is likely to be at the controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackay, 57, is the chief pilot of the world's first airline to space, and company officials are increasingly confident that the inaugural flight will lift off from Spaceport America in New Mexico this year. More than 700 people have bought flight tickets, which now sell for $250,000 each.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks like everything is coming together,'' said Mr. Mackay, in a mellow Scottish brogue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackay is a fitting aviator for a new era of space travel. He has flown some of the oldest and slowest planes, including a 1909 Blériot, the type that made the first flight across the English Channel. He's also flown 747s and British Harrier jets. With Virgin Galactic, he will be going much faster and higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up in Scotland in the 1960s, Mr. Mackay was captivated by NASA's push to put astronauts on the moon. Royal Air Force jets regularly roared above Helmsdale, the village on the east coast of Scotland where he lived, training to fly low over hilly terrain. When he learned that NASA's astronauts were mostly former military test pilots, Mr. Mackay plotted a career path: He would fly fighter jets, become a test pilot, then an astronaut to go to the moon and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Britain did not have a space program did not deter him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the naïveté of youth, I didn't know that,'' he said. ''I thought by the time I was in my 20s or early 30s, this was something that would be routine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackay did join the R.A.F. and become a test pilot. But NASA astronauts stopped going to the moon after 1972, and Mr. Mackay could not follow in their footsteps. When he reached his mid-30s, he, like most test pilots, moved to a managerial position behind a desk, which was not where he wanted to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He left the R.A.F. in 1995 and became a pilot for <span class="companylink">Virgin Atlantic</span>, the British airline founded by Mr. Branson -- a job that offered unexpected career opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin sponsored the successful effort by the billionaire and adventurer Steve Fossett to become the first person to fly solo and nonstop around the world without refueling. Mr. Mackay traveled to Mojave, Calif., in 2004 to meet with Burt Rutan, the designer of Mr. Fossett's airplane, the GlobalFlyer, and to review the technical documentation. (Mr. Fossett died in a plane crash in California in 2007.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he was there, Mr. Mackay tried out the flight simulator for another of Mr. Rutan's creations, a stubby rocket-driven craft that looks something like a tropical fish with two tails, launched into space from a companion aircraft. It was called SpaceShipOne, and Mr. Mackay was enthralled. ''I quickly became convinced of the potential,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that year, SpaceShipOne crossed the 62-mile altitude that marks the border of outer space, becoming the first privately built spacecraft to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Branson and Mr. Rutan announced a collaboration to build a larger version, SpaceShipTwo, which would hurl paying passengers, six at a time, beyond Earth's atmosphere on suborbital jaunts, which are essentially like big roller coaster rides -- up and then back down. The spacecraft is not powerful enough to reach orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackay joined Virgin Galactic in 2009 and two years later moved to Mojave, where the test flights are being conducted. He was one of two pilots on the most recent test in January, when the 60-foot-long SpaceShipTwo was ferried by its companion plane to 46,000 feet and then dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not quite a fall -- it's just a lightness as you separate,'' Mr. Mackay said. ''For a couple of seconds, it's really quiet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few seconds later, the rocket motor ignited, burning for 20 seconds. The acceleration was ''unrelenting,'' Mr. Mackay said, but the rocket was not as loud as he expected. ''It sounded like a very loud vacuum cleaner behind us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, SpaceShipTwo is ''nothing really new'' compared to other aircraft he has flown, he said. To make it to space, the rocket motor will have to fire for one minute instead of 20 seconds. Engineers have had to come up with a way to dampen vibrations in the motor as the fuel depleted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we've now gotten our head around it,'' said George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The test flights will resume this summer. Virgin Galactic has just finished modifications to the spacecraft, including a new landing gear. The interior is being spruced up, and the seats for the six passengers will soon be added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackay said the major remaining milestone was the see how the ship behaved as it re-entered the atmosphere at supersonic speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitesides estimated that there would be three or more flights to finish the objectives of the test program, then a few more to work out the details of operating a spaceflight company. Then Virgin Galactic could be open for business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackay's career is taking him to space, after all. But now he has other goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to get to the moon,'' he said. ''I want to go to Mars.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUFFY CANYONS, Belize -- I have never felt closer to the sky than when I was 170 feet under the ocean here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened on Easter morning. A half-dozen of us slipped out of a boat on the barrier reef here and followed our dive master, Michael, into a canyon, dropping through jagged openings past profusions of coral waving like wheat in the wind. There were clouds of fish, turtles and the occasional shark.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the ocean floor suddenly fell away. We were hovering like unharnessed window washers on a vast wall of rock and coral, the outermost edge of the second-longest barrier reef in the world, the boundary of the big deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were looking for a pod of dolphins that had graced these parts the day before. But I wasn't prepared for infinity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The color down there was the mother of all blues. I found it oddly comforting. Maybe it was just narcosis of the deep, but I've never felt so connected to the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been diving on and off for about 11 years. I got my certificate the day the space shuttle Columbia burned up over Texas with seven astronauts aboard, effectively ending the shuttle era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I climbed out of the water that day and went to my cottage on the island of Dominica and stared up at Orion, recalling my boyhood dreams of space travel and saying goodbye to them. The stars would never be my destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm no marine biologist. I dive for the childish joy of flying, zooming up and down like Superman, and for the Zen joy of being surrounded by colorful fish you can't catch, like errant thoughts you can't follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cosmos has a way of catching me. All the aspirations of the sky are concentrated down below. Inner space and outer space, yinning and yanging together. The sea is its own cosmos, but it is inextricably linked to the vast invisible ocean around us. The hydrogen in its water molecules was made in the Big Bang, the oxygen in them was made in a star -- a marriage made literally in heaven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electrons that glue those molecules together attained their masses and glueyness during a subtle shift in the properties of the vacuum, when the Higgs field and its famous particle, the Higgs boson, kicked in a trillionth of a second after the universe was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever meaning we can ascribe to the universe arose in these depths and those mysterious processes. All the logic of outer space, its vistas and apocalypses concentrated in this blue caldron of creativity and possibility, the restless sifting of chance, adaptation, survival and extinction. Life began percolating somewhere hereabout 3.5 billion years ago, crawling out into a new oxygenated atmosphere three billion years after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed the seas are a gene soup, according to the biologist J. Craig Venter, who has spent the last few years trawling for microbes in his yacht Sorcerer II and has discovered at least six million new genes. What they do is anyone's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inevitably as you hang in the blue void, you wonder if this magic has occurred anywhere else. I've spent my share of time gazing up at the Milky Way from campfires or my old backyard on summer evenings in the Catskills, wondering if anyone is, was or will be out there, or how we would ever know or meet them in the confounding depths of space and time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It always makes me feel lonely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last two decades, NASA's mantra in the search for life out there has been ''follow the water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last month NASA requested ideas for a robot mission to Jupiter's most enigmatic moon, Europa, whose sheath of ice is thought to encase an ocean with more water than is contained on the oceans of Earth. John M. Grunsfeld, the former astronaut who heads NASA's space science directorate, said, ''Europa is one of the most interesting sites in our solar system in the search for life beyond Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least for now, the plans don't include landing on Europa or drilling through the ice with a fishing pole or something more sophisticated, but one priority is to look for future landing sites on the moon. The agency's managers are looking for ideas that would cost less than $1 billion. Congress has already appropriated almost $100 million over the next two years to start developing technology for the trip. If that doesn't work, there is always Saturn's moon Enceladus, which apparently also has a hidden ocean and is spurting water and who knows what else from cracks known as ''tiger stripes'' near its South Pole. So there is some hope of yet discovering company in the form of pond slime or better in the solar system before the end of the century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it is the fate of cold, dark matter to be the cradle for warm, wet matter -- at least in this universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't know if this is a lucky universe or whether life is inevitable in some sense, or -- for that matter -- what life is. Most astrobiologists I know say they will recognize it when they see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime there is life down there, and it's hard not to feel connected when you are in the womb, so to speak. It's one place I'm never lonely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a certain pose you associate with dive masters, swimming backward, legs akimbo as if in a <span class="companylink">Barcalounger</span>, encouraging you onward. After a few minutes on the wall, Michael beckoned, thumbs upward, and we began the long slow ascent, keeping our eyes out for those dolphins, which did not appear again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to the sunny surface. Back to cosmic loneliness.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE tornadoes that have been devastating parts of the South and Midwest, just weeks after a deadly mudslide in Washington, demonstrate once again the unimaginable power of nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After each disaster, we grieve over the human lives lost, the innocent people drowned or crushed without warning as they slept in their beds, worked in their fields or sat at their office desks. We feel angry at the scientists and policy makers who didn't foresee the impending calamity or, if forewarned, failed to protect us. Beyond the grieving and anger is a more subtle emotion. We feel betrayed. We feel betrayed by nature.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aren't we a part of nature, born in nature, sustained by the food brought forth by nature, warmed by the natural sun? Don't we have a deep spiritual connection with the wind and the water and the land that Emerson and Wordsworth so lovingly described, that Turner and Constable painted in scenes of serenity and grandeur? How could Mother Nature do this to us, her children?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite our strongly felt kinship and oneness with nature, all the evidence suggests that nature doesn't care one whit about us. Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen without the slightest consideration for human inhabitants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first encountered the insensible power of nature during a two-week sailing trip with my wife in the Greek isles. It was just the two of us on a small boat. For the first few days of the voyage, traveling south along the coast from Piraeus to Cape Sounion, we were within sight of land. Then we turned west, toward Hydra. Soon, the land and other boats vanished. All we could see was ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, I felt elation. Then I felt fear. Because during the summer season, the Aegean Sea is plagued by a fierce, dry wind called the meltemi, which can appear without warning in clear air and be upon you in minutes with great waves and gales. At any moment, a wall of water and wind could have lunged from the horizon, washed over the boat, and drowned my wife and me. I realized that there was no compassionate overseer or oceanic consciousness to prevent that from happening. To the vast expanse of water, my wife and I were just additional pieces of flotsam and jetsam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our comfort with nature is an illusion. Here on earth, even with our earthquakes and storms, we have no conception of the range and the power of nature. In many other parts of the cosmos, conditions are far more extreme than on earth and quite inhospitable to life. On the planet Mercury, for example, the temperature reaches 800 degrees. On Neptune, it is minus 370. On Uranus, the winds exceed 350 miles per hour. With the recent work of the Kepler spacecraft, searching for planets favorable for life, we can estimate that only about one millionth of one billionth of 1 percent of the material of the visible universe exists in living form. From a cosmic perspective, we and all life are the exception to the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of recorded history, humankind has had a conflicted view of nature. In ancient times, we made awesome and frightening gods of the natural elements. The Babylonian-Assyrian god of storms, Adad, brought rain to the crops but also caused havoc and death on land and sea. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, both created and destroyed and was sometimes invoked to annihilate one's enemies. So close to nature are we in some mythologies that human beings are regularly transformed into other animals and even inanimate matter. In Aztec mythology, the twin volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl were once human lovers, later turned into mountains by the gods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the other direction, nature is constantly given human qualities. Wordsworth wrote that ''nature never did betray the heart that loved her.'' Mother Nature has comforted us in every culture on earth. In the 20th and 21st centuries, some environmentalists claimed that the entire earth is a single ecosystem, a ''superorganism'' in the language of Gaia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would argue that we have been fooling ourselves. Nature, in fact, is mindless. Nature is neither friend nor foe, neither malevolent nor benevolent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nature is purposeless. Nature simply is. We may find nature beautiful or terrible, but those feelings are human constructions. Such utter and complete mindlessness is hard for us to accept. We feel such a strong connection to nature. But the relationship between nature and us is one-sided. There is no reciprocity. There is no mind on the other side of the wall. That absence of mind, coupled with so much power, is what so frightened me on the sailboat in Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change documents the damage now being done by human-created greenhouse gases and global warming. In reacting to the report, we should not be concerned about protecting our planet. Nature can survive far more than what we can do to it and is totally oblivious to whether homo sapiens lives or dies in the next hundred years. Our concern should be about protecting ourselves -- because we have only ourselves to protect us.</p>

When so much is connected to the Internet, why is the aerospace industry using technology that predates fax machines to look for flash drives in the sea?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because, while technology for communicating from the ground has advanced rapidly in the last 40 years, technology for communicating from the sky has been stuck in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem starts not with planes, but with the satellites that track them. The Sentinel-1A satellite, for example, weighs two and a half tons, costs around $400 million, and was launched on a rocket designed in Soviet Russia in the 1960s. The Sentinel can store the same amount of data as seven iPhones. When was this relic from the age of mainframe computers sent into orbit? On April 3. Huge, expensive, rocket-launched satellites with little computing power may make sense for broadcasting, where one satellite sends one signal to lots of things (such as television sets) but they are generally too expensive and not intelligent enough to be part of the Internet, where lots of things (such as airplanes) would send lots of signals to one satellite. This is why most satellites reflect TV signals, take pictures of the Earth, or send the signals that drive GPS systems. It is also the reason airplanes can't stream flight and location data like they stream vapor trails: cellphone and Wi-Fi signals don't reach the ground from 30,000 feet, so airplanes need to be able to send information to satellites -- satellites that, as well as being unable to handle network data economically, are designed to talk to rotating, dish-shaped antennas that would be impossible to retrofit to airplanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution to these problems is simple: We need new satellite technology. And it's arriving. Wealthy private investors and brilliant young engineers are dragging satellites into the 21st century with inventions including ''flocks'' of ''nanosatellites'' that weigh as little as three pounds; flat, thin antennas built from advanced substances called ''metamaterials''; and ''beamforming,'' which steers radio signals using software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 9, a San Francisco-based start-up called Planet Labs sent a flock of 28 nanosatellites into space. The first application for this type of technology is taking pictures of the Earth, but it could also be used to receive data streaming from aircraft retrofitted with those new, flat ''metamaterial'' antennas. There are many other possible systems. Dozens of new satellite technologies are emerging, with countless ways to combine them. Streaming data from planes is about to become cheap and easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite revolution is not just about airplanes. David Cowan, a venture capitalist who is on the board of Skybox Imaging, a manufacturer of 220-pound ''microsatellites,'' calls the big picture ''planetary awareness.'' Combining data from sensors on satellite networks with information from things like phones, cars and planes will give us a comprehensive, constantly updating picture of the world. Everybody will be able to see everything from crops growing to traffic jamming to armies invading to icecaps melting. Vanishing airplanes will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's big aerospace companies may not embrace this revolution unprompted. Seeing satellites as network computers and airplanes as nodes that communicate with them requires a new mind-set. Airlines, airplane makers and regulators are feeling perplexed and defensive about the public outcry over their inability to know where their planes are and whether something is wrong with them. One industry insider told me, ''There's no cost-effective justification for streaming data from aircraft. What would you do if you had the information?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the many things you would do: You would never again put the families of 239 people though an agony of uncertainty as you searched for an airplane that flew itself for hours until it ran out of gas and crashed into the sea.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How did you become interested in astronomy?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. When I was 7 and growing up in Kerala, the gorgeous state on India's southwest coast, I had the opportunity to get a clear view of a total solar eclipse on Oct. 24, 1995. Being an educator, my mother made sure that my siblings and I watched it, of course wearing eye-protecting filters. It was an unforgettable, formative experience. In midday, the sun slowly disappears, the sky goes dark, birds start chirping like they think it's nightfall. Ever since then, I've had a million-and-a-half questions about how the universe works. How does everything happen? Where does it come from? Or go? Is there other life out there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are profound questions. But do they have anything to do with real life on Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I like about astronomy is that it not only can explain but it can also predict. Studying asteroid paths can let us know what we need to be aware of and perhaps come up with solutions to prevent those asteroids from hitting the Earth. Science tells us the Earth will probably get too hot to support plant life in several hundred million years, give or take a few million. It's not that far away in the larger scheme of things. Learning about the life cycle of other stars helps us understand what might happen to our own sun in that time. I believe science can provide some answers, and, in time, some solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did you major in astronomy in college?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to be clear, I am not an astronomer. For that you need a Ph.D. I moved alone to Chicago from India at 17 to attend Shimer College, mainly because of its Great Books curriculum and because it seemed to promote the same kind of intellectual curiosity and inquiry my mother encouraged. I graduated in 2009 with a concentration in social sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do you like about your job the most?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's definitely when I see kids' eyes light up when I trigger their imaginations. Recently, I presented a video that represented how large a crater can be, first showing it close up, then pulling back until we see a person as a tiny dot at the edge of it. A third-grade boy in my audience could not contain his amazement, jumped from his seat and shouted, ''Oh wow, that's the coolest thing.'' I live for those moments.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDNASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft slammed into the moon early Friday morning, as planned, but a few days earlier than NASA officials expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At about 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, radio signals from the spacecraft abruptly cut off just as it passed over to the far side of the moon. Mission managers believe that is the moment when it ran into a crater rim -- they suspect they even know which crater rim -- but that has not been confirmed yet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. ''It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,'' Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. ''What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,'' Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. ''Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,'' Dr. Elphic said in an interview. ''We see it fairly sporadically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. ''Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,'' Dr. Elphic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 12, 2014, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 19 about the crash landing on the moon of NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft, using information from NASA, misstated the density of the moon's atmosphere as compared with Earth's. It is one-quadrillionth that of Earth's atmosphere, not 1/100,000th. The error also appeared in an article on Sept. 1, 2013, about the moon mission.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a bit bigger and somewhat colder, but a planet circling a star 500 light-years away is otherwise the closest match of our home world discovered so far, astronomers announced on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as Kepler 186f, named after NASA's Kepler planet-finding mission, which detected it, has a diameter of 8,700 miles, 10 percent wider than Earth, and its orbit lies within the ''Goldilocks zone'' of its star, Kepler 186 -- not too hot, not too cold, where temperatures could allow for liquid water to flow at the surface, making it potentially hospitable for life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kepler 186f is the first validated, Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of another star,'' Elisa V. Quintana of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> and NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., said at a news conference on Thursday. ''It has the right size and is at the right distance to have properties similar to our home planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Quintana is the lead author of a scientific paper describing the findings in this week's issue of the journal Science. Kepler 186f is the latest planet to be sifted out of the voluminous data collected by Kepler, which kept watch over 150,000 stars, looking for slight drops in brightness when a planet passed in front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This follows the announcement last year that another star, Kepler 62, has two planets in its habitable zone, but those two were ''super Earths,'' with masses probably several times that of Earth. The gravity of those planets might be strong enough to pull in helium and hydrogen gases, making them more like mini-Neptunes than large Earths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its smaller size, Kepler 186f is more likely to have an Earth-like rocky surface, another step in astronomers' quest for what might be called Earth 2.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a progression,'' said another member of the discovery team, Thomas S. Barclay of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute. ''This planet really reminds us of Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers speculate that it is made of the same stuff as Earth -- iron, rock, ice, liquid water, although the relative amounts could be very different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravity on Kepler 186f, too, is likely to be roughly the same as Earth's. ''You could far more easily imagine someone being able to go there and walk around on the surface,'' Stephen Kane, an astronomer at San Francisco State University and another member of the research team, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 186f is not a perfect replica, however. It is closer to its star -- a red dwarf that is smaller, cooler and fainter than our sun -- than the Earth is to its; its year, the time to complete one orbit, is 130 days, not 365. It is also at the outer edge of the habitable zone, receiving less warmth, so perhaps more of its surface would freeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Perhaps it's more of an Earth cousin than an Earth twin,'' Dr. Barclay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, with its greater mass, Kepler 186f could conceivably have a thicker, insulating atmosphere to compensate. Red dwarfs emit more of their light at the longer infrared wavelengths, which would be more readily absorbed and trapped by ice and gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This makes the planet more efficient at absorbing energy from its star to avoid freezing over,'' said Victoria Meadows, an astrobiologist and planetary astronomer at the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span>. ''Which is why this planet is still considered potentially habitable, as long as it has a dense enough atmosphere, even though it receives less light from its star than Mars does from our sun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''It's fun to note that if the planet is habitable, photosynthesis may be possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the wavelengths that plants need, Kepler 186f receives only about a sixth as much light as Earth does, but ''there are plenty of Earth plants that would be quite happy with that,'' Dr. Meadows said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers cannot tell the exact age of the star, but such dwarfs are the longest-lived stars in the universe. If Kepler 186f is habitable, life would have had plenty of time -- billions of years -- to take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But speculation about the planet will remain speculation for a long time, if not forever. The Kepler measurements indicated only the size of Kepler 186f. It is too far away for astronomers to discern its mass, much less whether it has an atmosphere and oceans or if it teems with living creatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, since dwarfs are the most plentiful type of star in the galaxy, astronomers are hopeful that Earth twins are plentiful, and that some will be found close by, allowing other telescopes to make temperature and mass measurements or to identify molecules in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler's original mission ended last year, with the failure of equipment that kept the telescope precisely pointed, but scientists still have years of work in analyzing the data, which has so far yielded 962 confirmed planets. More than 2,800 planet candidates remain to be studied.</p>

Since the March 8 reopening, school group bookings are up, and so are weekend ticket sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not every benefit is obvious to visitors. For one thing, there is considerable improvement in the job satisfaction of Marc Taylor, manager of planetarium and science programs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel much less like I'm spending my time running around climbing ladders in the dark trying to fix things,'' said Mr. Taylor, 43, of Manhattan. Before the upgrade, ''kids would sometimes giggle when things went wrong, which they often did,'' he said recently after hosting an hourlong program in the updated space for a class of second-graders from the Greenvale School, in Eastchester. Some mishaps during past shows, such as the one in which a special effect nearly caught fire, were too serious to giggle over, Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we have an attraction where school groups and the public can come and learn without being distracted by the mechanisms behind the presentation,'' he said. ''I can relax and concentrate more'' on what visitors are getting out of the planetarium's programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Hudson River Museum</span> has been projecting representations of the heavens onto its 120-seat dome since 1969; it serves roughly 7,000 weekend visitors and 7,000 area school children annually. Its last equipment upgrade was in 1987, with the installation of a machine known as the Zeiss M1015, which relied on slides, videotape, laser disc machines and mirrors to display the planets, moon, sun and 7,000 other stars The recent upgrade, financed by the City of Yonkers, included a $130,000 rebuilding of the existing dome, which ''was not quite the right shape and sort of corroded,'' Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the money went toward high-tech equipment including the Ohira-Tech Megastar II, a computerized optical star projector that can display a Milky Way composed of millions of individual stars; a pair of twin video projectors that cover all 2,500 square feet of the dome using nine computers; a new sound system and lighting; and a new power supply. The Megastar and projectors work separately and together. On its own, the Megastar, a colorful apparatus whose squat, rounded body calls to mind the "Star Wars" robot R2D2, generates the sky, but more realistically than its predecessor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at the real sky, you see stars just on the verge of being visible. If you don't have that in a simulation, it doesn't look right,'' Mr. Taylor said. The simulated sky that predated the Megastar ''was believable, but it didn't sort of tease your eyes like the real sky and the new system,'' he said. When the projectors work in tandem with the Megastar, orbits and other sky features stay in correct alignment with the stars. During the show ''The Sky Tonight,'' offered to the public on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the systems work together to project constellation lines, which illustrate what the sky will look like on the evening of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time travel in the refurbished planetarium is not limited to jumps into the same-day sky, though. From behind his console in the darkened dome, with a few strokes of his keypad, Mr. Taylor demonstrated the way the night sky looked from Earth roughly six months ago, how it will look in six months' time, and how it will look in 18 months. He can as easily travel backward or forward through centuries using the Megastar and projectors, something that would have taken hours to orchestrate before the upgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now it's instantaneous. You tell the computer 'Go a thousand years into the past,' and it just does it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those journeys have not inspired the biggest oohs and aahs from young audiences since the reopening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Probably the most spectacular thing is when we take off from Earth. We rise up and you can see the Earth below us,'' Mr. Taylor said. During the presentation for the second-graders, a flight through the rings of Saturn to the four moons of Jupiter also prompted appreciative gasps. For Mr. Taylor, a favorite aspect of the new system's bells and whistles is its ability to display exoplanets, those that orbit suns other than ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those kids who came today?'' he said. ''When they were born the number of known exoplanets was several dozen. Now it's in the thousands. And we can see them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students like 8-year-old Sofia Caballes, one of the Greenvale second-graders, may be less excited about exoplanets than the chance to leave Earth for a realistic, hourlong ride into outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I liked it in there,'' she said after Mr. Taylor's presentation, on the way to the bus back to school. ''I felt like I was on a rocket ship.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The shock waves are still reverberating from the bombshell announcement of the discovery of cosmology's holy grail: telltale signature of ripples in the very fabric of space generated as it ''inflated'' during our cosmic origins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that if this discovery holds up, it will go down as one of the greatest in the history of science. It teaches us humans that we need to think big, because we are the masters of underestimation. Again and again we have underestimated not only the size of our cosmos, discovering that everything we thought existed was merely a small part of a much grander structure (a planet, a solar system, a galaxy, a universe, and maybe even a multiverse), but we have also repeatedly underestimated the power of our human minds to understand our cosmos.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By discovering hidden mathematical patterns and regularities in nature that we call equations of physics, we have gotten progressively better at predicting things -- from tomorrow's weather to tomorrow's technology. The planet Neptune, the radio wave and the Higgs boson were all predicted mathematically before they were observed. Our most audacious prediction ever is the theory of cosmological inflation, which extrapolates known physics to energies a trillion times higher than those of the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation predicts that our baby universe grew very much the way you yourself did right after conception: Each of your cells doubled roughly daily, causing your total number of cells to increase day by day as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Repeated doubling is a powerful process, so your mom would have been in trouble if you had kept doubling your weight every day until you were born. After nine months (about 274 doublings), you'd have weighed more than all the matter in our observable universe!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crazy as it sounds, this is exactly what inflation does: It takes a speck of matter with less mass than an apple, smaller than a billionth the size of a proton, and repeatedly doubles its size until it is more massive than our entire observable universe, because of an instability in Einstein's theory of general relativity. And whereas you doubled in size once per day, our universe doubled once every hundredth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, just as you eventually stopped your regular doubling and began growing at a more leisurely pace, so did our baby universe, once it had exploded to the size of a grapefruit. But at this point it was flying apart so rapidly that its expansion continued for another 13.8 billion years, during which it cooled and clustered to form ever more interesting objects: quarks, nuclei, atoms, stars, planets and, ultimately, us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the claim that physics needs less than an apple's worth of mass to create the billions of galaxies that adorn our current cosmos is certainly extraordinary. Fortunately, this theory makes a long list of predictions, and we cosmologists have become awestruck as they've proven correct at an ever-accelerating pace, with a recent crescendo culminating with the startling discovery of ancient ripples in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions confirmed so far include that our universe is expanding (1929), that it was once as hot as the surface of the Sun and left behind an afterglow (1965) that can be photographed to provide baby pictures from when it was 400,000 years old (1992), and that the spots in these baby pictures have the predicted sizes (1999-2000) and a large number of other predicted properties to exquisite precision (past decade).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was the mother of all predictions: that the repeated early doubling of space was violent enough to cause ripples in the fabric of space known as gravitational waves, and that these would be so intense and huge (close to a billion light years long) that no other process could have made them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making such strong gravitational waves requires extreme violence, and one can prove that any physical process other than inflation would make predominantly shorter ones. For example, a cataclysmic collision of two black holes squeezing more than the Sun's mass into a volume smaller than a city can create gravitational waves that the American-based LIGO experiment hopes to detect -- but these waves are only about as big as the pair of objects creating them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why my colleagues and I felt so amazed when it was announced that enormous gravitational waves had been discovered. Gravitational waves distort light, and after spending three years zooming in on about 1 percent of the sky from the Bicep2 telescope near the South Pole and taking an even sharper baby photo of our universe, including its polarization, scientists discovered that it was distorted in precisely the way inflation had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now what? First of all, we will look forward to seeing whether other experiments can confirm the Bicep2 findings. Because gravitational waves from inflation have long been the holy grail of cosmology, the search for them has been intensely competitive, so if the gravitational waves are as long and strong as claimed, then many other experiments will soon detect them and measure them even more precisely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, this discovery has triggered big spring cleaning in theoretical physics. If the results stand the test of time, they rule out not only all compelling competitors to inflation (including the cyclic-ekpyrotic universe models), but also the vast majority of popular inflation models. For both the Higgs boson and inflation, the original models were extremely simple, and then creative theorists added bells and whistles to concoct countless complicated models during the decades that followed. In both cases, however, the experimental results brought us ''back to basics,'' agreeing beautifully with the simplest models and chalking up striking victories for Occam's razor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If inflation really happened, it fundamentally transforms our understanding of our origins. We need to stop saying that inflation happened shortly after our Big Bang, because it happened before it, creating it. It is inappropriate to define our Hot Big Bang as the beginning of time, because we don't know whether time actually had a beginning, and because the early stages of inflation were neither strikingly hot nor big nor much of a bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation is better thought of as a Cold Little Swoosh, because at that time our universe was not that hot (getting a thousand times hotter once inflation ended), not that big (less massive than an apple and less than a billionth of the size of a proton) and not much of a bang (expanding a trillion trillion times slower than after inflation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In sum, Bicep2 has revealed that our Hot Big Bang was created by a Cold Little Swoosh, and that although we humans may be small, the power of our minds to figure things out has superseded our ancestors' wildest dreams.</p>

It has survived mechanical malfunctions, computer glitches, tricky sand traps, ferocious dust storms and long, frigid Martian winters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maybe not the budget ax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's baseline budget proposal for the fiscal year 2015 has an ominously low number for Opportunity: $0. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, now circling the moon, also crashes to zero in the budget proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, they and five other long-lived robotic missions are up for what the space agency calls a ''senior review'' to ensure that they are still producing enough science to justify the cost of continued operations. Proposals are due on Friday, with decisions coming in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But planetary scientists are asking whether the budget numbers suggest that NASA has already written off the two spacecraft. The other five missions are the Mars Curiosity rover, two Mars orbiters, NASA's contribution to the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Mars Express mission, and Cassini, which is orbiting Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To see Opportunity zeroed was a bit shocking and surprising,'' said Steven W. Ruff, a research professor at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span> and a member of the rover's science team, ''and it contradicted my understanding of what this senior review process was supposed to be about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have been insisting to scientists that they have not come to any conclusions, saying that they had to fill in tentative budget numbers before the senior review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Opportunity is on top or L.R.O. is on top, they will be funded,'' James L. Green, director of NASA's planetary science division, said at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference outside Houston last month. ''We'll reprogram as necessary to be able to cover these missions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House also put forth a $52 billion supplemental spending proposal that included $35 million for NASA's planetary missions, enough to sustain Opportunity and the moon orbiter. But the money would come in large part from eliminating some tax breaks for the wealthy, and House Republicans have been cool to the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Houston conference, Dr. Ruff asked why Opportunity had been shunted to the supplementary proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What mission would you like me to put there?'' Dr. Green replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Something other,'' Dr. Ruff said, to laughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green urged the scientists to put aside their budget worries. ''I would love for the community not to worry about where the money is, and how they're going to get it, because they need to write a proposal to get it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But financial constraints raise the uncomfortable possibility that one or two missions will fall short even if all seven teams make compelling cases. ''I would be surprised if any of the missions were ranked very low in science,'' said Casey Dreier, director of advocacy for the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>, a nonprofit organization that promotes space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year Opportunity cost $13.2 million to operate and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter $8.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For each of the past three years, the administration has proposed deep cuts in planetary science and Congress has restored some of the money. For the 2015 fiscal year, which starts Nov. 1, the Obama administration is proposing $1.3 billion, more than in the last couple of years, but less than the $1.5 billion that this part of NASA received a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very discouraging that we have to go through this fight year after year,'' said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat whose district includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which operates most of the robotic missions. Mr. Schiff wants a planetary science budget closer to $1.5 billion so NASA can also afford future robotic missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tea leaves in the budget proposals can be misleading. Last year's proposal from the administration suggested that spending for the Cassini mission would end in 2015. This year, the money reappeared in the administration's budget, which describes Mars Curiosity and Cassini as ''high-priority extended missions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will bet that Opportunity finds a way to keep going,'' said Mr. Dreier of the <span class="companylink">Planetary Society</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings, published in the journal Science, confirm what planetary scientists have suspected about the moon, Enceladus, ever since they were astonished in 2005 by photographs showing geysers of ice crystals shooting out of its south pole.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we've done is put forth a strong case for an ocean,'' said David J. Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology and an author of the Science paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many researchers, this tiny, shiny cue ball of a moon, just over 300 miles wide, is now the most promising place to look for life elsewhere in the solar system, even more than Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Definitely Enceladus,'' said Larry W. Esposito, a professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span>, who was not involved in the research. ''Because there's warm water right there now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enceladus (pronounced en-SELL-a-dus) is caught in a gravitational tug of war between Saturn and another moon, Dione, which bends its icy outer layer, creating friction and heat. In the years since discovering the geysers, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has made repeated flybys of Enceladus, photographing the fissures (nicknamed tiger stripes) where the geysers originate, measuring temperatures and identifying carbon-based organic molecules that could serve as building blocks for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini has no instruments that can directly detect water beneath the surface, but three flybys in the years 2010-12 were devoted to producing a map of the gravity field, noting where the pull was stronger or weaker. During the flybys, lasting just a few minutes, radio telescopes that are part of NASA's Deep Space Network broadcast a signal to the spacecraft, which echoed it back to Earth. As the pull of Enceladus's gravity sped and then slowed the spacecraft, the frequency of the radio signal shifted, just as the pitch of a train whistle rises and falls as it passes by a listener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using atomic clocks on Earth, the scientists measured the radio frequency with enough precision that they could discern changes in the velocity of Cassini, hundreds of millions of miles away, as minuscule as 14 inches an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found that the moon's gravity was weaker at the south pole. At first glance, that is not so surprising; there is a depression at the pole, and lower mass means less gravity. But the depression is so large that the gravity should actually have been weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then you say, 'A-ha, there must be compensation,' '' Dr. Stevenson said. ''Something more dense under the ice. The natural candidate is water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liquid water is 8 percent denser than ice, so the presence of a sea 20 to 25 miles below the surface fits the gravity measurements. ''It's an ocean that extends in all directions from the south pole to about halfway to the equator,'' Dr. Stevenson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underground sea is up to six miles thick, much deeper than a lake. ''It's a lot more water than Lake Superior,'' Dr. Stevenson said. ''It may even be bigger. The ocean could extend all the way to the north pole.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conclusion was not a surprise, said Christopher P. McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., who studies the possibility of life on other worlds, but ''it confirms in a really robust way what has been sort of the standard model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also makes Enceladus a more attractive destination for a future mission, especially one that would collect samples from the plumes and return them to Earth to see if they contain any microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussion on the possibility of extraterrestrial life in the solar system centers on four bodies: Mars; Enceladus; Europa, a moon of Jupiter; and <span class="companylink">Titan</span>, another moon of Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McKay, who was not involved with gravity measurements, noted that only Enceladus was known to possess the four essential ingredients for life, at least as it exists on Earth: liquid water, energy, carbon and nitrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would say it's our best bet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars has a dearth of nitrogen, found in amino acids and proteins, and the surface today is dry and cold. Europa, which also has an under-ice ocean, may have all of the ingredients, but that has not been confirmed. Ice plumes have also been observed coming off Europa's south pole, but intermittently. <span class="companylink">Titan</span> is the most intriguing and speculative possibility, with lakes of liquid methane, not water. If life existed there, it would be far different from that on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, life on Enceladus is perhaps a long shot. The sea is at freezing temperature and in continual darkness. And the water may have been liquid only in the recent past, a few tens of millions of years, a blink in the 4.5-billion-year history of the solar system. But scientists also do not know how long it takes life to get started, and some think it could happen quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is there life in the plume?'' Dr. McKay said. ''To answer that question, a sample return would be the way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a couple of proposals for that already, including one by Peter Tsou, a retired scientist from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Tsou devised a way to capture comet particles and bring them back to Earth for NASA's Stardust mission and has been suggesting a similar method for a spacecraft that would fly through Enceladus's plumes and then return to Earth for scientists to examine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges are to make sure that the interesting particles would not break apart, to take precautions that any alien life would not infect Earth, and to fit it into the $500 million budget of one of NASA's lower-cost planetary missions.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said Wednesday that it was suspending most contacts with <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span> officials, underscoring just how rapidly the Russian-American relationship is deteriorating in the wake of the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea and hinting at further ramifications that will go beyond previous rifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one exception, NASA said, would involve operations of the International Space Station, the primary space collaboration between the two countries.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, the extent of NASA's break in relations is broad and includes ''travel to Russia and visits by <span class="companylink">Russian government</span> representatives to NASA facilities, bilateral meetings, email, and teleconferences or videoconferences,'' Michael F. O'Brien, the agency's associate administrator for international and interagency relations, wrote in an email to top NASA officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years of collaboration, the Russian-American partnership in space has continued largely immune to the geopolitical ups and downs between Washington and Moscow, and as recently as a few weeks ago officials expressed optimism that would still be the case, with the NASA administrator, Charles F. Bolden Jr., saying, ''Right now, everything is normal in our relationship with the Russians.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the confrontation over Ukraine intensifies, it became untenable for the Obama administration to continue sending NASA officials to Russia or hosting their space agency officials in the United States as if all were normal, even as Washington cut off trade talks and military cooperation and threw Russia out of the Group of 8 industrial nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has also directed the Air Force to review the use of Russian engines in rockets that send American military satellites into orbit. The Atlas 5 rockets, now produced by a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, have been built for years with Russian-made RD-180 engines. American officials are exploring the consequences of possible supply interruptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the administration was not going so far as to cut off all cooperation, especially just a week after sending a NASA astronaut to the International Space Station along with two Russian cosmonauts in a Russian capsule. Further measures could seriously jeopardize the American space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the retirement of the space shuttles, NASA astronauts get their rides into orbit aboard Russian Soyuz rockets at a cost of up to $70 million a seat. NASA is financing commercial companies to develop rockets and spacecraft to start carrying astronauts as soon as 2017. At a congressional hearing last week, Mr. Bolden said the program, called commercial crew, was the ''critical need'' for the human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new restrictions are similar to ones that limit what NASA is allowed to do with China because of worries, particularly by Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, that China would take advantage of collaborations to copy American technologies. Under those rules, NASA cannot host any Chinese citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to suspend the relationship with the <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span> is unusual for several reasons, not least because keeping the space enterprises alive has long been a symbol of Washington's commitment to an apolitical working relationship with Moscow. Breaking it, some government officials have feared, would invite the Russians to retaliate by suspending nuclear inspections under the new Start treaty -- inspections that have continued despite the differences over Ukraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Obama administration's decision was made easier by the dwindling nature of the nation's space program. Grand plans for international space programs have largely withered, as the space shuttle program has ground to an end. ''There's a sense that we don't need the space relationships the way we once did,'' one senior government scientist said, ''because we don't have as much going on in space.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have discovered a second icy world orbiting in a slice of the solar system where, according to their best understanding, there should have been none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're in no man's land,'' Scott S. Sheppard, of the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> in Washington, said of the objects, which orbit far beyond the planets and even the ring of icy debris beyond Neptune known as the Kuiper belt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intriguingly, the astronomers said that details of the orbits hint at perhaps an unseen planet several times the size of Earth at the solar system's distant outskirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planetoid, an estimated 250 miles wide, is now 7.7 billion miles from the sun, about as close as it gets. At the other end of its orbit, the planetoid, which for now carries the unwieldy designation of 2012 VP113, loops out to a distance of 42 billion miles. Neptune, by contrast, is a mere 2.8 billion miles from the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much farther out, a trillion miles, the solar system is believed to be surrounded by a sphere of icy bodies known as the Oort cloud, where many comets are thought to originate. But between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, astronomers had expected empty space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery, by Dr. Sheppard and Chadwick A. Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, is reported in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For convenience, the scientists shortened the 2012 VP113 designation to VP, which in turn inspired their nickname for the planetoid: Biden, after Vice President Joseph R. Biden. Dr. Trujillo said they had not decided what to propose for the official name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existence of 2012 VP113 could help explain why there is anything out there at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2000s, when Michael E. Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, scanned the outer solar system, his biggest discovery was Eris, a ball of ice in the Kuiper belt that was Pluto-size or slightly bigger, the impetus for the demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown's oddest discovery, however, came a couple of years earlier: Sedna, a 600-mile-wide planetoid also beyond the Kuiper belt, three times as far from the sun as Neptune. Its 11,400-year orbit stretches farther than that of 2012 VP113.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the youth of the solar system, there would not have been enough matter out there to coalesce into something as large as Sedna. It was too far out to have been flung by the gravitational slings of big planets, but too close to have been nudged by the gravitational tides of the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having found one such body, astronomers expected to quickly find more, and they came up with a name for them: Sednoids. But for years, no one found any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the latest search, Dr. Trujillo and Dr. Sheppard used a 13-foot telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. In November 2012, they spotted a moving point of light beyond the Kuiper belt -- 2012 VP113. Follow-up observations last year confirmed it was a Sednoid. Scientists have come up with various ideas to explain such bodies. Dr. Brown, for one, thinks the Sednoids were pushed there when the sun was part of a dense cluster of stars -- ''a fossil record of the birth of the solar system,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others suggest that a rogue planet, ejected from the inner solar system, dragged the Sednoids along as it flew through the Kuiper belt. Dr. Trujillo and Dr. Sheppard point out that the orbits of Sedna and 2012 VP113 have similarities to those of several other Kuiper belt bodies, which could be a sign of an unseen planet's gravitational influence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer simulations showed that the similarities could be explained by a planet with a mass five times that of Earth about 23 billion miles from the sun, too dim to be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harold F. Levison of the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., who models the beginning of the solar system, agreed that this was a possibility. ''I think they've convinced me there's something going on,'' he said of Dr. Trujillo and Dr. Sheppard. ''But I think it's too early to say that it's a planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers expect to find more Sednoids in the next few years, which could solve the mystery of their origin. ''When we find 10 of them, I'll tell you what the answer is,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While circling the earth aboard the International Space Station for a full year -- the longest single space adventure for any American astronaut -- and after his return, scientists will closely monitor Commander Kelly to see what changes space has wrought. NASA has been studying the effects of long stays in space on astronauts for years, but this set of 10 investigations will be different: The scientists will be doing the same poking, prodding and analyzing on Commander Kelly's identical twin brother, Mark, a retired astronaut.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those in-depth studies could lead to a deeper understanding of the effects of living in space, which will become increasingly important as NASA plans missions to Mars or other destinations that could take years to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have a very long-term vision,'' said Dr. Andrew Feinberg, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who is one of the investigators involved with the project. ''It's kind of amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies of twins are a favorite tool of scientists to understand environmental influences, and having the only identical twins to have flown in space as human guinea pigs opens physiological and psychological research opportunities for NASA. The space agency has budgeted $1.5 million for the 10 three-year studies, which were first proposed by the Kellys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Feinberg said he would perform a full genome analysis of both men to study any epigenetic effects -- that is, how the environment changes the genes and their function. Mark Kelly, who like his brother is a retired <span class="companylink">United States Navy</span> captain, has been to space four times, as a shuttle pilot and commander, ending his last mission in 2011. He is married to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords; after an attempt on her life in 2011 and her resignation from Congress the next year, they formed Americans for Responsible Solutions, an advocacy organization working to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, criminals and terrorists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent visit to The New York Times, the Kelly brothers, who are 50, showed that whatever your accomplishments in this world or off it, you're still kind of a knucklehead when your brother is around. When the question of primacy was raised, Mark Kelly noted that he was six minutes older than his brother. But Scott Kelly was quick to point out that he was the first to space, ''and I'll be the last.'' When a photographer asked one of them to stand slightly in front of the other for a portrait, they jokingly elbowed each other to be the one out front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Kelly said that an extended expedition aboard the space station is easier now than in the past, with decent access to email and telephone communications as well as entertainment programming, exercise equipment and good air quality. (The old Russian space station Mir apparently was smelly, humid and moldy.) Scott Kelly said that on his previous mission to the station, ''I had a little bit of degradation'' physically, ''which is good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing that his body is likely to change during this longer stay is promising, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their enthusiasm for the experiment has startled NASA scientists. ''I volunteered to have them put a pressure probe in my skull,'' Scott Kelly said. ''I thought it would be kind of cool to have a little bolt,'' he said, tapping a spot on his head. The scientists decided that it might cause problems, and demurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he returns to earth, he said, he will have spent 540 days in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had 55,'' Mark said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fifty-four,'' Scott corrected him. ''But who's counting?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Kelly said he was often asked the difference between a long flight and a short flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The length,'' Mark deadpanned. Deadpanning is a family trait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Kelly said that during his shorter flights, he felt that it was not possible to really adapt to the changes the body experienced in conditions of microgravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After a 17-day shuttle flight, you don't feel 100 percent of anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Kelly said that during his previous trip to the International Space Station, which began in 2010 and lasted six months, he felt he had fully adapted after the second month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Kelly predicted that this time, his brother would tire of life in space after a few months. ''Halfway through, you're going to say, 'O.K., where's my ride?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space race, which culminated in 1969 with Apollo 11's lunar landing (top left), sparked fashion's interest in futuristic colors and synthetic materials. Take Melvin Sokolsky's 1963 image of a helmeted model hovering over the Seine in a giant plastic orb (bottom left). The designer Hussein Chalayan unveiled a similarly bubble-heavy look (top right) in 2006, while Chanel's spring couture collection (center) delivered shiny retro-futuristic dresses with bejeweled sneakers, all of which would fit right in at Terminal 3 of China's Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport (bottom right), designed by the Italian firm Studio Fuksas.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this spring's <span class="companylink">Christian Dior</span> haute couture show, a translucent skirt resembled a series of half-lit moons (center), while the black diamonds that cover Pomellato's Sabbia ring conjure images of a lunar surface embedded with craters (top left). Although it's impossible to ever see the texture of the moon's landscape when it's fully illuminated (right), the German scientific photographer Julius Grimm achieved that very effect in his 1888 painting ''Mond'' (bottom left).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sky's the limit when it comes to celestial-inspired fashion. The Greek deity Artemis is often depicted with a crescent-moon crown, and in 1816, a production of Mozart's ''The Magic Flute'' showed its star-covered Queen of the Night suspended from a heavenly set designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (top left). The designer and muse Loulou de la Falaise later adapted the look at her wedding party in 1977 (right), as did Catherine Deneuve's character in Jacques Demy's film ''Donkey Skin'' (center left). Nothing, however, reflects the majesty of a shining star like jewels, such as the diamonds in Chanel Fine Jewelry's Comète collection (bottom left) and the rhinestone headpiece worn this spring at Schiaparelli couture (center right).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ancient civilizations worshiped the sky while later cultures tried to make sense of the stars (top left). The great Jantar Mantar observatory in New Delhi, India (bottom right), was constructed in 1724 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who believed that the instruments of that era were too small to precisely measure time or track the positions of the stars. The earliest such tool that we know of, a Bronze Age Nebra sky disc (bottom left), was discovered in Germany in 1999, and calls to mind Line Vautrin's moonlike mirror from 1965 (top right).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visionaries have long been fascinated by the exploration and escape inherent in the cosmos. Bringing the fantasy of space travel back down to earth, this season Versace couture showed a fully embroidered evening dress straight out of a science-fiction film (right). Less tangible but altogether more real are flights leaving from Virgin Galactic's $209 million Spaceport America terminal in New Mexico (center) later this year -- something that the English poet William Blake could never have predicted when he created his 1793 engraving ''I Want! I Want!'' (left).</p>
