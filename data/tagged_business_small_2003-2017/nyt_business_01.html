<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an eight-day losing streak that ended on Tuesday, the stock market has generally been buoyant in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The bullish mood could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and lead to continuing gains for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet important measurements -- some of which I developed -- tell us that the market is quite expensive and that investor optimism is tinged with plenty of worry. None of this tells us where the market is going tomorrow, but it suggests that some caution is advisable, and that returns over the next decade or so are likely to be constrained.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider first the evidence from what is often called the Shiller CAPE ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is CAPE, or the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, exactly? Bear with me. This is a bit technical: It is real, or inflation-adjusted, stock price divided by a 10-year average of real earnings. It is usually measured using the price and earnings of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, adjusted for inflation with the Consumer Price Index. In 1988, John Y. Campbell (now at Harvard) and I showed in a joint article that such a ratio has, since 1881, forecast returns somewhat well in the stock market. That ''somewhat'' is important because the ratio has its limits as a forecasting tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We found back then that averaging earnings over 10 years smoothed short-run or cyclical fluctuations, providing a better indicator of fundamental value. The CAPE ratio has successfully explained about a third of the variation in real 10-year stock market returns in United States history since 1881.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the important point: In 1988, we found that CAPE had averaged about 15 since 1881. In years when CAPE was lower than that, subsequent 10-year returns for the stock market tended to be good. In years when it was higher, the 10-year returns tended to be bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why today's CAPE is sending a troubling message. The ratio is now almost 30. Using monthly data, it has been higher only in 1929, when it reached 33, and in the few years around 2000, when it reached 44. In both instances, sharp market declines followed those very high readings. The current level of CAPE suggests a dim outlook for the American stock market over the next 10 years or so, but it does not tell us for sure nor does it say when to expect a decline. As I said, CAPE is useful, but it does not provide a clear guide to the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor sentiment is another factor, and current readings also give us cause for concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been involved in regular opinion surveys of institutional and individual investors in the United States since 1989. These surveys are undertaken and published online by the Yale School of Management. From these data, I created a Valuation Confidence Index, which is the percent of respondents who think the domestic stock market is not overvalued; a Crash Confidence Index, which is the percent who think that a 1929- or 1987-style crash in the next six months is highly unlikely; and a One-Year Confidence Index, which is the percent who think the stock market will go up in the next year. The indexes are measured in six-month intervals, and our latest data are for the six months through February, which includes the election of President Trump on Nov. 8, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valuation confidence in February was quite low. The only time it has been lower was in the years surrounding the market peak of 2000. In February, crash confidence was quite low too, though it has been slightly lower on a number of occasions since 1989. These two indicators might seem to confirm the apparent signal of the CAPE ratio: trouble ahead. They are certainly saying that investors aren't confident that current prices are reasonable or that the market is stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one metric went the opposite direction. One-year confidence is at a record high for institutional investors, and it is at the highest level since 2007 for individual investors. (That means, by the way, that in 2007, the eve of the Great Recession and financial crisis, most people had no clue that big problems were imminent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to reconcile these results. One possible interpretation might be that respondents perceive a stock market bubble: They think valuations are high and there is a non-negligible probability of a crash. At the same time, they are hanging in because they think the Trump boom will probably last for at least another year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't provide much reassurance. The high fraction of our survey respondents who think that the stock market is unlikely to fall in the next year may simply reflect a failure of imagination about how a Trump bull market could suddenly end. There are scores of ways, of course. Just because people can't picture a big decline doesn't mean that they won't react very badly if the market comes under real stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people appear to believe that a business-oriented president will preside over a long stock market boom. At a glance, there appears to be some precedent for this, first with the 1920 election that brought in President Warren G. Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge (who took over when Harding died in 1923) and then with the 1980 victory of Ronald Reagan. These elections were followed by the Roaring Twenties of 1921 to 1929 and the Millennium Boom market of 1982 to 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in both cases, during the initial election campaigns the economy was in recession and the CAPE ratio was extremely low -- around 5 in 1920 and 9 in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are in a very different situation now. The economy has largely recovered from the last recession, and CAPE shows us that stocks are now relatively expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no clear message from all of this. Long-term investors shouldn't be alarmed and shouldn't avoid stocks altogether. But my bottom line is that the high pricing of the market -- and the public perception that the market is indeed highly priced -- are the most important factors for the current market outlook. And those factors are negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't know where the market will go this month or this year. It could well rise a lot. But investors should not let themselves be tempted to bet aggressively on the Trump bull market.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOLEDO, Ohio -- The cream of the small-business community here tucked into their lunch on a top floor of a bank building and pondered the question put to them by their local lender's economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than any other president since Ronald Reagan, President Trump is moving to strip away regulations and slash taxes, said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist with <span class="companylink">Fifth Third</span>, a large regional bank in the Midwest and Southeast. In meetings with clients, Mr. Korzenik has been making the case that these policies will rouse the slumbering animal spirits in businesses across America.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And now we have seen this huge spike in small-business confidence since the election,'' Mr. Korzenik said, pointing to a chart. ''So I have to ask you: Do you feel more confident now?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a moment of silence, broken only by a howling northwestern Ohio wind that rattled the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bank's boardroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, with rapid-fire speed, came the responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of a trucking company spoke of a ''tremendous dark cloud'' lifting when he realized he would no longer be feeling the burden of rules and regulations imposed by the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner of an automotive parts assembler gave thanks that he would not be receiving visits from pesky environmental and workplace overseers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the head of a seating manufacturer expressed hope that, finally, his health care costs would come down when the Affordable Care Act was repealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My gut just feels better,'' said Bob Fleisher, president of a local car dealership. ''With Obama, you felt it was personal -- like he just didn't want you to make money. Now we have a guy who is cutting regulations and taxes. And when I see my taxes going down every quarter -- well, that means I am going to start investing again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much has been made about the stock market's nearly 14 percent rally since the election, economists say that when it comes to assessing the genuine potential for the United States economy, confidence among small-business owners is a more grounded and forward-looking indicator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that employ several to a few hundred workers make up 99 percent of business in the United States and account for half of private sector employment. So for all that <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> or <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> talks about building factories and hiring workers, the $18 trillion United States economy will not truly move until the burghers in Toledo and other parts of the country start to invest and add jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exuberance of small-city executives in Toledo, of course, represents just a small slice of the national economy -- an economy whose recovery had already been showing signs of gaining momentum. And their euphoria is being fed by promises, like a tax overhaul, that have not yet been kept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the views from the Toledo lunch are very much in tune with what business leaders, large and small, have been consistently saying in the months since the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billed as a C.E.O. round table, the event felt more like a boisterous group therapy session as one businessman interrupted another with competing tales of Obama-era regulatory woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all 11 executives agreed: Never in recent years had they been so bullish about their businesses as they were now under a president (and fellow small-business owner, albeit a very rich one) whom they see as one of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why Mr. Korzenik was so excited about the recent surge in the small-business confidence index, as measured by the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, the industry's trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the month after Mr. Trump was elected, the gauge showed the largest monthly increase since 1986. And it has continued to reflect consistent gains as the president pushes for lower taxes, fewer regulations and a repeal of President Barack Obama's health care initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the jump came off low levels. Since 2009, the index had been either on a downward trend or barely moving up as small businesses struggled to recover from the financial crisis. A heavier regulatory burden and uncertainty born of a weak economic recovery have kept small-business owners from making big bets in investments or hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Toledo, this reluctance is changing -- and quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis M. Soltis owns a small company that manufactures control panels for large factories and machines. After four years of not adding to his work force of 22, he has seen orders for panels jump in the last two months and is looking to take on as many as six new workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may not be a direct correlation between his surging order book and the new president, but there is no doubting the psychological boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That guy is a junkyard dog, doing his tweets at 3 a.m. and taking on the news media -- I just get strength from him,'' Mr. Soltis said over a wine-soaked dinner with a large group of his small-business friends and peers from around town. ''And I have to say, it makes you feel gutsy -- ready to step up and start investing again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restaurant sits on the eastern bank of the Maumee River, offering up a view of the modest Toledo skyline. For years, many of the taller buildings have stood empty as this largely industrial city, a bit more than an hour's drive south of Detroit, suffered from the automotive industry's decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of late, the local economy has been recovering as thriving industries like health care have picked up the slack, and the unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, stands exactly at the national figure of 4.7 percent for February. The latest employment data, released on Friday, showed that 235,000 workers were added to payrolls nationwide last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Soltis is not the only small-business leader to report a sharp pickup in activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barton S. Kulish, the president of MTS Seating, which makes seats and tables for restaurants and offices, said that his sales were up 38 percent after the election. Since the beginning of the year, he said he has had to bring on eight more workers (and plans to hire an additional 12) to his 418-employee company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Keller, the chief executive of Keller Logistics, said a sharp rise in trucking orders since the election prompted him to recently increase his shipping rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the local real estate market is still buzzing with news of a 300,000-square-foot industrial space, which, after drawing little interest for the better part of a year, suddenly became the target of a frantic bidding war among three local parties before finding a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there is a downside to animal spirits that persist too long, especially in labor markets, like Toledo's, that are operating on the tight side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is a sharp uptick in inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his presentation to <span class="companylink">Fifth Third</span>'s banking clients, Mr. Korzenik raised this issue, suggesting that the broader economy was in the ''seventh inning'' of what has been a pretty long business cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted how the opioid epidemic in the Midwest had made it harder for companies to find qualified young people ready to work -- a comment that elicited nods from around the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, no one in the room seemed overly concerned. As the group saw it, the party was just beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most businesses I know are just taking a deep breath, happy that there is finally someone in the White House who understands what they do,'' said Mr. Fleisher, the owner of the Lincoln car dealership. ''So you say we are in the seventh inning -- well, I am not sure we are.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job reductions, in addition to 7,000 positions eliminated last year, come as the Zurich-based bank, like much of the industry, struggles with low interest rates around the globe and a lack of confidence among investors for much of last year cut into its results. Turmoil in the financial markets in 2015 sent <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in 2015 to its first annual loss since 2008.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor sentiment improved in the fourth quarter, and the bank said it had positive inflows in its wealth management business in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Thiam's leadership, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> is shifting its business model away from riskier, capital-intensive trading and banking businesses. The bank, which has large operations in New York and London, has shrunk the size of its investment bank and is placing greater emphasis on its wealth management business, particularly in Asia and other emerging markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After joining the bank in 2015, Mr. Thiam announced plans to raise $6.3 billion in new capital and reduce its costs by billions of dollars by the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> had 47,170 employees at the end of the fourth quarter. The bank also reported an annual loss of 2.4 billion Swiss francs, or $2.39 billion, for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will not relent on the pace of cost reductions going forward,'' Mr. Thiam said during a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman said that the bank first targeted consultants and contractors as part of its job reductions and that those jobs reflected the majority of last year's cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thiam had previously served as the chief executive of the British insurer Prudential. The restructuring has led to some tensions among <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the bank said it would accelerate its cost-cutting and shrink its investment bank, with Mr. Thiam saying that the size of the positions on the bank's trading book ''was a surprise for a number of people and was not a widely known fact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the bank said that it would further reduce costs by an additional 1 billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> reported a fourth-quarter loss of 2.35 billion francs, compared with a loss of 5.8 billion francs in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 24 percent, to 5.4 billion francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2.17 billion francs of the loss stemmed from litigation provisions primarily related to a $5.3 billion settlement reached with the <span class="companylink">United States Justice Department</span> in December over the packaging and sale of toxic mortgages before the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement, which was completed last month, resolved claims that <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, like many other financial institutions at the time, bundled together unsuitable mortgages into securities that contributed to the financial crisis in 2008, when the American housing market collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry as a whole has paid tens of billions of dollars to resolve claims over the sale of those securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth quarter of 2015 also included a write-down of 3.8 billion francs after <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> reassessed the value of its investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thiam also said that the bank remained on track with its preparatory work for a partial initial public offering of its Swiss unit in the second half of this year but said that the bank would examine other potential options in light of the regulatory environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a plan,'' Mr. Thiam said. ''The fact that we always look at other options has not diminished or diluted that we have a plan and we are implementing it. It's our job to look around.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRUSSELS -- <span class="companylink">European Union</span> officials on Tuesday sharply lowered growth forecasts as member states like France, Germany and Italy showed weak economic performance, and as business confidence suffered from heightened geopolitical risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth is expected to be a meager 1.3 percent in the 28-member bloc this year, instead of the 1.6 percent predicted in the spring, said the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>, the union's executive arm. And the economy is not expected to get much better in 2015, when growth in Germany, the region's economic engine, is expected to grind down to about 1 percent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economic and employment situation is not improving fast enough,'' Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission vice president for jobs and growth, said in a statement accompanying the closely watched economic forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless there are additional signs of growth and job creation in the next five years, ''people could despair of the European project,'' Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery on the Continent continues to lag those in the United States and Britain. Over the next two years, annual growth in Britain is expected to be close to 3 percent, and the unemployment rate is projected to be 5.5 percent in 2016, according to the data released Tuesday. The unemployment rate in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> is not expected to fall below double digits, where it has been since 2012, until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomier outlook will most likely raise expectations for the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, though economists said they did not expect policy makers to take action at a meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on Tuesday did not take into account how the European economy might get a boost from a 300 billion euro, or $375 billion, plan to invest public and private money into infrastructure projects. Jean-Claude Juncker, who took office this month as president of the European Commission, has pledged to present that package before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how much of an effect that would have on lackluster growth remains to be seen. The spending program is unlikely to ''change the whole world,'' Mr. Katainen said, but ''its contribution can be significant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower forecasts, especially in the 18-nation euro area, where the commission cut its projection for growth this year to 0.8 percent from an earlier 1.2 percent, are a measure of how quickly optimism about a recovery has dissipated. France has failed to grow as hoped, and Italy struggles to make overhauls. There are also signs that the German economy is stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the more drastic downgrades for 2015, the commission lowered Germany's forecast for growth by nearly a full percentage point to 1.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the problems facing European economies like Germany is the prospect of a ''new cycle of sanctions and countersanctions'' related to the restrictions that the United States and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> imposed on Russia in retaliation for its role in the Ukraine crisis, and reciprocal moves by Moscow, <span class="companylink">European Union</span> officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tensions ''could pose a larger roadblock to European growth prospects than currently envisaged in the forecast,'' the officials said in a report accompanying the forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tensions might also ''have triggered a wait-and-see attitude among firms,'' the officials wrote in a section of the report that focused on Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany is expected to post growth of 1.3 percent this year, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8 percent. The French economy is expected to grow 0.3 percent this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy appeared to stand out as a poor performer: Its economy was predicted to shrink 0.4 percent this year compared with a forecast in May for growth of 0.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission also expressed concerns about inflation, which it said would remain very low this year and would not come close to the target of just under 2 percent anytime soon. It projected an annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With confidence indicators declining since midyear and now back to where they were at the end of 2013, and hard data pointing to very weak activity for the rest of the year, it is becoming harder to see the dent in the recovery as the result of temporary factors only,'' officials wrote in their report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission said it expected growth rates to improve somewhat in 2015, rising to 1.5 percent in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and to 1.1 percent in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, weaker-than-expected growth this year is likely to make it much harder for countries like France and Italy to achieve the bloc's mandated targets to keep budget deficits and government debt in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France and Italy could face disciplinary action and steep fines if they fail to show that they are making sufficient effort to bring their economies in line with European budgetary rules. Mr. Katainen said those recommendations would be published by the end of this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the commission said, the most recent figures indicate a slow fading of the legacy of the sovereign debt crisis, with many member states still weighed down by high unemployment, high debt and low output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prompted Mr. Katainen, the commission vice president, to call on member states to agree on the €300 billion spending plan to bolster demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Accelerating investment is the linchpin of economic recovery,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany also ''can play a significant role stimulating the euro area and E.U. economy'' by saving less and spending more, Mr. Katainen said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment fell more than expected on Wednesday to its lowest level since 2012, intensifying worries that the eurozone's largest economy is at risk of slipping into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stalwart German economy has anchored the rest of the eurozone during four years of intermittent crisis and uneven growth. Any pause in German growth spells trouble for countries like France and Italy, which depend heavily on trade with Germany, and are in much worse shape economically.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German economy already suffered a decline in the second quarter, when output fell 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter. Another consecutive quarterly decline would put the country into recession, according to a popular definition of the term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The eurozone's biggest economy has reached a dangerous stage between soft spell and longer-lasting almost-stagnation,'' Carsten Brzeski, an economist at <span class="companylink">ING Bank</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey by the <span class="companylink">Ifo Institute</span> in Munich showed that its business climate index, a composite of managers' expectations for the future and their assessment of the current situation, fell to 104.7 in September, from 106.3 in August, the lowest level since April 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the survey, expectations for business in the next six months hit their lowest reading since December 2012, falling to 99.3, from 101.7 in August. The survey of about 7,000 managers measures sentiment compared with 2005, when the index was set at 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The German economy is no longer running smoothly,'' Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ifo survey is the latest warning of flagging economic output in the eurozone, which has yet to recover to levels seen before the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. On Tuesday, a survey of purchasing managers in the eurozone by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, also signaled slowing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told members of the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> in Brussels that ''the economic recovery in the euro area is losing momentum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German economy has suffered from turmoil in Ukraine, which has unsettled consumers and businesses and made them hesitant to spend. The sanctions that the West imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, which added to existing weakness in the Russian economy, has sapped demand and weakened the ruble. In addition, German exports have been hit by sluggish growth in the rest of the eurozone and weak demand from developing countries like China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been talk in Berlin of stepping up spending on infrastructure such as autobahns or university campuses, but the government led by Angela Merkel has shown little appetite for immense fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, has expressed pride that the government will not need to borrow money next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each new sign of flagging growth raises expectations that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will soon resort to large-scale purchases of government bonds, the same so-called quantitative easing used by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to spur growth in the United States. Economists at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span>, among others, expect the central bank to begin quantitative easing early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, other economists doubt that the central bank is ready to risk alienating Germany, where many people regard government bond purchases by the central bank as a de facto transfer of wealth from richer European countries to poorer ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The E.C.B. is ready to do everything but buy government bonds,'' Joachim Fels, chief global economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, told reporters here on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists do not expect the central bank to announce plans to buy government bonds at its next meeting, on Oct. 2. The central bank has already said it would buy private sector debt, beginning next month, and was expected to provide details next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists consider fears of another eurozone recession overblown. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, noted that the United States economy also sputtered several times before regaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not uncommon during a recovery to have temporary pauses,'' Mr. Paulsen said in an interview last week. Referring to the eurozone economy, he added, ''What's been happening in recent months looks very familiar to me.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eurozone's flatlining economy took another hit on Monday when data showed German business sentiment sagging for the fourth consecutive month. Chancellor Angela Merkel attributed some of her own country's decline in the second quarter to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, over which tit-for-tat sanctions threaten trade. The Munich-based Ifo, a research firm, echoed some of those sentiments as it reported its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 companies, fell to a worse-than-expected 106.3 from 108, the lowest level in more than a year. The findings agreed with data earlier in the month on the second-quarter contraction in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy. Klaus Wohlrabe, an Ifo economist, said his institute expected growth in Germany to be ''close to zero'' in the third quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Legislators, friends, fellow New Jerseyans:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last week has certainly tested this Administration. Mistakes were clearly made. And as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve. I know our citizens deserve better. Much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I also want to assure the people of New Jersey today that what has occurred does not define us or our state. This Administration and this Legislature will not allow the work that needs to be done to improve the people's lives in New Jersey to be delayed. I am the leader of this state and its people and I stand here today proud to be both. And always determined to do better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I come before you once again to report on the state of our state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today, the state of the state is good, and getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, we were in the throes of economic crisis. Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8%, the lowest in 5 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, we were losing jobs. Today, we have gained 70,000 jobs in the last year alone, and a total of 156,000 in the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, wealth and jobs were leaving the state. Today, personal income for New Jerseyans is at an all-time high, and we are attracting new companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that has brought jobs -- four straight years of private sector job growth. In fact, in November, the drop in our unemployment rate was the largest one month drop ever measured. And in the last year, New Jersey had the second largest drop in its unemployment rate in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could have chosen to go down a path of continued tax increases to fund the state's addiction to spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we didn't. We held the line against any new taxes, and brought spending in the current fiscal year to a level below Fiscal 2008 -- six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could have let state government grow, even while the private sector shrank. But we didn't. Today, there are 6,000 fewer state employees than four years ago, but over 155,000 more private sector employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We improved our business climate, and today, by every measure, business confidence in New Jersey is up. In fact, one national magazine ranked New Jersey among the top 5 states with the most improved business climates in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no accident how we got to this place today. We chose the way. And in this new year and in the next four years, we need to build on this momentum by creating a new attitude: we need to create an attitude of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not about choosing everything; it is not about saying yes to everyone; it is about setting our priorities and choosing to invest in New Jersey where it matters and to put in place the reforms and reductions that make it possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the best part of our turnaround in these past four years is because we have chosen to work together. These are our achievements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four balanced budgets. Passed with bipartisan support. Pension reform and tenure reform. Passed with bipartisan support. A cap on property taxes. Passed with bipartisan support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We acted and we acted together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the competition among the states is fierce, no state has shown more bipartisan cooperation over the last four years than New Jersey. Let's do it again. Let's resolve that in spite of politics, we will continue to put our people first. We will choose to do our jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things that drove people out of New Jersey in the past decade was high property taxes. In 2010, together, we capped them. The 2% cap has worked. In these past two years, property tax growth has been the lowest in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the job is not finished. Property taxes are still too high. So today, I ask for you to join me in enacting a new property tax relief initiative that tackles the root causes that are driving up property taxes in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, some context: the 2% cap we've already enacted has worked for a reason. We've done it by controlling costs. We accompanied it with reform of an interest arbitration award system that needed fixing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you know, the interest arbitration cap was not permanent -- it is set to expire this April, unless we act. So I ask you today, let us renew the cap on interest arbitration awards and make the cap permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason property taxes are so high is that our cities and towns are stuck with a series of costly state rules that increase the cost of local government. As the cost of government grows, taxpayers are paying the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have worked with the Senate to try to pass real consolidation and civil service reform. We haven't gotten it done in the Assembly. We need to have an effort that includes everyone responsible for property taxes -- the Senate, the Assembly, our Administration and local government to provide local government with the authority to run their governments like a business: consolidate, share services, cut duplication and ultimately actually reduce property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at what happened last year in Princeton. Princeton Borough and Princeton Township consolidated into a single government. Not two tax departments, two police forces, two offices answering the phone. The savings in one year: $3 million. That's on a budget of $64 million, a 4.7% savings. And the citizens of Princeton got this: more services, despite a smaller budget, and a reduction in municipal taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not just my opinion -- the local unit alignment, reorganization and consolidation commission said that civil service seniority rules were at the top of the list of barriers to shared services. Let's help our towns clear away arcane rules that stand between them and lower property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to driving costs, let's not forget the expensive practice of sick leave payouts for government employees. Sick time should be used when you're sick. If you're lucky enough to be healthy, that's your reward. Sick leave has been abused too many times, and the cost is real. Almost a billion dollars in liability facing New Jersey towns - $880 million to be exact. And it will only get higher if the system is not fixed. These reforms are common sense: let's lift this billion dollar albatross off the necks of New Jersey's towns. Let's together enact the zero means zero plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our pension system is burdened by some who collect disability retirement because they claim they are ''totally and permanently disabled,'' but who are now working full-time. So we've established by Executive Order a special unit to prosecute pension fraud. Let's go even further to solidify our pension system and reduce costs by reforming our disability retirement system to end this fraud and abuse. This will also help us to reduce property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some towns get around the property tax cap by enacting user fees to fund traditional services that used to be in the budget. Let's end this practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will have more to say about New Jersey's taxes when I present my budget to you next month. That is for a reason. We have to consider changes to our tax system in the context of our overall budget picture. We will present some of these choices in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will tell you one choice we will not make -- because it is one answer that will not help grow our state: raising taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the evidence is clear that increasing taxes hurts our growth, it is equally clear that improving education is a key to helping our growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've made some great progress in these past four years: a record amount of school aid, long-overdue reform of our system of teacher tenure, an increase in the number of charter schools and an Urban Hope Act that is bringing renaissance schools to some of our most challenged cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some results are promising too. Last year, New Jersey's high school graduation rate increased by a full percentage point, to 87.5%. Student achievement is strong in many of our public schools, and New Jersey's students are among the country's greatest achievers. Just a few years ago, a graduate of my own high school, Livingston High School, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are making a large investment in public education: New Jersey spends over $25 billion a year, all told. Our per pupil expenditure is the highest in the nation at over $17,000 per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases - too many - our children are not receiving the education they deserve. While many public schools are strong, too many are still failing. While the vast majority of teachers are performing well, some are underperforming -- and they should be removed from the classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need to be better is particularly acute in New Jersey's cities. Our urban schools demand our attention, and believe me, they have mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where bold action was necessary, we have taken bold action. And we have made a commitment to the kids in our cities that they have a right to the same quality education as kids in our suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our largest school system, in Newark, we have brought in a new organization and new resources, not only in the form of state aid but in collaboration with parents, teachers, and community leaders on the ground. One result -- we negotiated a historic contract with the teacher's union and delivered real merit pay alongside increased teacher involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most importantly we want to encourage innovation while listening to the specific needs of our urban communities. It's the reason why we have empowered our superintendents in Newark and Camden to make choices that work best for their kids, their parents and their schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Newark, that superintendent is Cami Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cami has moved to pay the best teachers, to stop actions that are failing kids, to empower 50 new principals, create cooperation between public schools and charter schools and reorganize the school systems' structure to focus on putting students, schools and parents first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early childhood enrollment has increased by more than 1,000 students. Graduation rates have increased by 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newark is leading the conversation in making sure every kid -- those who are behind, those who are ahead, those who have special education needs -- are lifted up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every kid means every kid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her efforts haven't always been met without skepticism, but she is a true partner with Newark. Cami is here with us today -- Cami, thank you for your commitment to our kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad has it been in Camden? Last year, only three students graduated ''college ready.'' Paymon Rouhanifard is bringing that same energy to Camden's public schools. He has turned around a perennially low-performing charter school to showing some of the largest academic gains in the state. He has launched a new ''safe corridors'' program with Mayor Dana Redd, which has created safe walking routes to and from school for our children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of the 345 students who have dropped out in the last year, we went door-to-door and re-enrolled 50 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paymon, thank you for your efforts and your dedication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Cami and Paymon have this Administration's confidence and support to continue the aggressive reforms needed that work best for the communities of Newark and Camden and put kids first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cami and Paymon are emblems of my commitment to ensuring the opportunity for an excellent education to every child in New Jersey, regardless of the ZIP code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the improvements we are seeing in Newark and Camden, I believe we need to take bigger and broader steps to adjust our approach to K-12 education to address the new competitive world we live in. Our school calendar is antiquated both educationally and culturally. Life in 2014 demands something more for our students. It is time to lengthen both the school day and school year in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If student achievement is lagging at the exact moment when we need improvement more than ever in order to compete in the world economy, we should take these steps - every possible step - to boost student achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one key step is to lengthen the school day and the school year. So, working with Commissioner Cerf, I will present to you shortly a proposal to increase the length of both the school day and the school year in New Jersey. This is a key step to improve student outcomes and boost our competitiveness. We should do it now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of our new initiatives recognize a core feature of modern American life: that the quality of education and the quality of life in our communities are inextricably intertwined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why this year, we need to be more aggressive, and bolder, in fixing our failing schools - and delivering a choice to those for whom today the only option is a bad option: a failing school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a moral obligation. We must give every New Jersey child the chance to graduate from high school, to be ready for college and to prepare for a career. If we fail to meet this obligation, we compromise the life of that child, and we hurt the quality of life in our communities and in New Jersey. So failure is not an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If education is one key to the quality of life in New Jersey communities, our approach to safe streets and stronger communities is another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every New Jerseyan should be concerned when violent crimes occur right before our eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a young lawyer went to open the door of his car for his wife after an evening of pre-Christmas shopping. He was set upon by thugs who wanted to carjack his S.U.V. and, in front of his new wife, he was shot in the head and left for dead on the deck of the mall parking garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outstanding police work led to four arrests, and the suspects are now charged with murder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four had prior criminal records. All four are, fortunately, now in jail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can we tolerate such violence in our midst? The answer is obvious: we cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must take a new approach to fighting crime in New Jersey and prevent tragedies like this from happening. We must do everything we can to swiftly jail those violent criminals who bring additional murder and disruption to innocent victims across our state. We have the tools to do this -- some we've begun, some we have not. 2014 must be the year we finish the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What have we not finished? Almost two years ago, I announced a proposed constitutional amendment to modify the right to bail in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept is simple: New Jersey courts should have the right to keep dangerous criminals off the streets and in jail until trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this important? A study by the federal government's Justice Department found that one-third of defendants released before trial ended up being charged with some type of pretrial misconduct. One-sixth were arrested for a new offense -- and half of those were felonies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government allows a violent criminal who is a danger to the community to be held without bail. New Jersey law does not. This must change. How can we justify exposing our citizens to the risk of violent crime at the hands of those, already in custody, who we know are disposed to commit it? There is no justification for that. Let us mirror federal law. Pass bail reform now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, we have made progress in reducing crime in New Jersey. Over the past decade, violent crime is down 16%, both across New Jersey, and in our 15 largest urban centers. And the state's prison population is down 20% since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we can do better, and we must. Those 15 urban centers still account for more than half of all the violent crime in New Jersey, despite representing only 18% of the state's population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For too long, Camden has been one of the most dangerous cities in New Jersey, and in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability to put police on the street was constrained by tight budgets, low morale, and an absentee rate that sometimes reached 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under an agreement that this Administration signed with the City of Camden and Camden County, we have regionalized the police force. A police force of slightly more than 200 that was sharply reduced in response to budget cuts is now being beefed up to 400 county police officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the homicide rate was down, and the crime rate was down -- by over 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle is far from won. But under Mayor Dana Redd, Police Chief Scott Thomson, and Jose Cordero, who helped decrease crime in East Orange by 75%, Camden is using a new approach -- using technology to predict crime, and engaging the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Camden is moving in the right direction. And I agree with Senator Sweeney that we should have incentives for other communities to adopt the shared service agreements and regional police forces that are making more cops on the street possible. More cops on the streets means safer communities. To make this happen, we will reintroduce shared services and consolidation reform in this session of the Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must reach out a hand of compassion and common sense to those who commit nonviolent crimes. We must do a better job of reclaiming their lives and putting them back on the road to success and engagement with society. My belief is simple: every human life is precious, and no life is disposable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why I proposed last year to change our approach to nonviolent drug offenders, and mandate treatment, not imprisonment. Together, we made this possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drug court program has been a success, thanks in part to your support in funding both the court and the treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I thank you for passage this past year of the Overdose Protection Act. We should not be prosecuting those Good Samaritans and health professionals who are trying to help in a life-threatening overdose situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's approach to reclaiming lives is working. Recidivism has dropped by 11%, one of the steepest drops in America. And New Jersey is rightly recognized by national experts as a leader among states in reducing incidents of recidivism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For me this is personal. In this room today is a man who was a drug addict at 16 years old. His life was at risk, but treatment saved him. He was rehabilitated at Daytop Village. He graduated from high school, went to college, and ultimately got a law degree. I had the privilege of hiring and working with Craig Hanlon at the U.S. Attorney's Office, and Craig is with us now in this Chamber. If you need proof that reclaiming a life is possible and that every life has precious value, then that proof is standing before you today. Craig, welcome -- and thank you for making new jersey a better place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Craig, I know the passion and strength that comes from the desire to have a better life. And I believe we can do more to help give people a second chance. That is why I am proposing an initiative to expand integrated treatment and employment services for individuals receiving drug treatment services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By providing grant funds in the amount of $500,000 to be managed in partnership with The Nicholson Foundation, we will place individuals in jobs and help improve their retention. We will work directly with treatment providers to integrate employment services with treatment services for drug court participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows that employment during substance abuse treatment helps ensure continued participation in treatment and sustainable long-term employment. With this partnership we will help empower individuals who want and deserve the opportunity to live a life well lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago this afternoon, our state was in recovery from a challenge not of our own making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey in the fall of 2012 -- flooding our homes, turning off our power and destroying our roads. Despite the magnitude and devastation of the storm, Sandy could not break out spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer, most businesses at the Shore opened on time. Boardwalks were rebuilt. The crowds came back. And schools that had been damaged were reopened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, about nine months after the first phase of CDBG disaster recovery funds started flowing in New Jersey, nearly $900 million -- more than two-thirds of the funds for housing recovery programs are out the door or in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the very beginning, the priority was putting those with the greatest needs and with the most limited financial resources at the front of the line. Of the nearly half of the housing money that has been obligated so far, 72.9% has been awarded to low- and middle-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line is this: we are a long way from the finish line, but we are a long way from where we were one year ago. Challenges remain and I will not rest until every person hurt by Sandy has their life back. That is my mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to thank this Legislature, and all New Jerseyans, for the cooperative, bipartisan and resilient spirit you demonstrated in coming back from Sandy. Let that spirit of Sandy be a powerful lesson to all of us, that when times are most difficult, cooperation and progress are possible. Indeed, they are necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, let me share with you one more, hard truth that makes this new attitude of choice necessary for New Jersey's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have discussed many exciting opportunities for investment in our state. K-12 education. Higher education. Crime prevention. Drug rehabilitation and job training. Health care. Infrastructure investment. Lower taxes. Job growth. All exciting, all of which, done responsibly, could make New Jersey an even greater place. But here is the simple truth. We cannot afford to do it right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of our pension and debt service costs. For the Fiscal Year 2015 Budget, the increase in pension and debt service costs could amount to as much as nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's nearly $1 billion we can't spend on education. That we can't invest in infrastructure improvement. That we can't use to put more cops on the street. That won't be available to improve access to health care. And for those who would advocate for higher income taxes like the ones I have vetoed before, remember that the amount raised would not even cover the increase in our scheduled pension payment and would undoubtedly make us less competitive in the job market nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the consequences of failing to engage in an attitude of choice. If we continue in an era where we believe we can choose everything, we are really choosing nothing. We need to have the conversation now about further changes to our pension system and to adding further to the state's debt load. But the time to avoid this conversation and these choices is nearly over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we do not choose to reduce our soaring pension and debt service costs, we will miss the opportunity to improve the lives of every New Jersey citizen, not just a select few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am ready to engage in those conversations and help, with you, to truly create an attitude of choice. The result will be a better, smarter, stronger New Jersey. The results from our refusal to choose -- a weaker New Jersey with a middle class burdened by even higher taxes. That is an abandonment of our duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centuries ago, a philosopher wrote that ''choice, not chance, determines your destiny.'' And this remains true for New Jersey today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our destiny is not set -- it is the product of the choices we make. Our future is not set -- it, too, is the product of the choices we make from this day forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let us choose wisely. And let us not fail to act. Let us create an attitude of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us choose to invest in better schools, and not a status quo in which we leave some children behind and put the rest at risk of being swallowed by a rising tide of mediocrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us choose the path of safer streets, and not leave our families vulnerable to the heartless carjackers and muggers who would destroy our quality of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us celebrate every life by creating an opportunity for every citizen, through an excellent education, a productive job, and a thriving community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this hour of choice, let us choose a better New Jersey. For that is what we owe our citizens, our children, and ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey has long been blessed by an abundance of natural resources and human talent. In 2014, we have been blessed by a return to prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us all choose to make the most of it -- together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of New Jersey.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- Business sentiment among major manufacturers in Japan is at its highest in more than two years, a closely watched central bank survey showed Monday, in a sign that the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are continuing to lift Japan's corporate outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s ''tankan'' survey for the three months through June showed that the headline index for major manufacturers rose to 4 from negative 8 in the previous quarter, the second consecutive quarter of improvement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index beat market expectations that it would rise to 3; the reading Monday was the highest since March 2011, and the first positive reading since September that year. It compares with a dismal result of negative 48 four years ago, in the depths of the global economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nikkei average climbed 1.3 percent to a one-month high after the upbeat tankan, finishing the day at 13,852.50, its third straight session of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The corporate improvement comes six months into Mr. Abe's bid to jump-start Japan's economy with a combination of aggressive monetary easing, government stimulus and a package of promised economic changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An immediate effect of his policies has been a weaker yen, which has come as a boon to Japan's exporters by inflating the value of their overseas earnings. Earnings at Toyota and Japan's other big manufacturers have already gotten a big boost from the tumbling currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tankan also showed improved sentiment in the service sector, with the index for big non-manufacturing companies rising 6 points to 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey ''showed a broad-based improvement of corporate sentiment from March to June, as widely expected,'' Masamichi Adachi, a Tokyo-based economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading fell short of Mr. Adachi's forecast of 9, however, thanks in part to cautiousness on the part of many manufacturers in assuming that the yen will remain weak in the longer run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyohei Morita, Japan economist for <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, wrote in a note that improved business sentiment was in line with expectations and set the stage for strong economic growth for Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We look for Japan to outpace its G7 peers'' in economic growth, he said, referring to the conference of seven industrialized nations. Last month, government figures showed that Japan's gross domestic product grew at a robust annualized pace of 4.1 percent in the first quarter, by far the fastest clip among the Group of 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are now watching to see whether the positive turn in mood at Japan's big companies will trickle down to Japan's consumers. On that front, the evidence is mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tankan measures sentiment by conducting a survey of Japan's largest companies and subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are negative from those who say they are positive.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- Germany's famously thrifty consumers may finally be more willing to spend, according to data released Monday, raising the prospect that domestic demand could take the place of flagging exports and help pull the rest of Europe out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ifo business climate index, which is considered a reliable predictor of the direction of the largest economy in Europe, rose slightly more than expected in March, to its highest level since July, the Ifo Institute in Munich said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unusually, retailers accounted for the rise in the Ifo index; manufacturers and builders became a bit more pessimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is probably early to declare a turning point, there are signs that falling unemployment and rising real estate prices are giving Germans confidence to do more shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Domestic components are holding up better now,'' said Thomas Harjes, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in Frankfurt. ''We are at the beginning of seeing some rebalancing of the German economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's economy has traditionally been driven by exports of cars and machinery, while domestic demand has been comparatively weak. In fact, the country has been something of a graveyard for retailers. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> gave up trying to crack the German market in 2006. Karstadt, the nation's largest chain of department stores, filed for insolvency in 2010, although it has since restructured and become profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany has the largest trade surplus in Europe, which partly reflects the success of manufacturers like Daimler and <span class="companylink">Siemens</span>, but also is a function of weak demand for imported goods. The rest of the euro zone, much of which is stuck in recession, would benefit if Germans bought more products and services from their neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, stronger domestic demand would make Germany less susceptible to economic ups and downs in major export markets like China and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Ifo index pointed only to modest growth in Germany, the resiliency of German business confidence helped calm fears that the nation's economy was slowing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a survey of purchasing managers by the research firm Markit signaled that the broader euro zone probably slipped into recession in the first quarter of 2012. The Markit survey also showed that German manufacturers were becoming less optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harjes of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> pointed out that the Ifo index surveys 7,000 companies, seven times as many as the Markit survey. The Ifo survey therefore captures more small and midsize enterprises oriented toward domestic customers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists generally portrayed the Ifo results as positive, some were more cautious. Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, noted that the indicator rose more slowly in March than in previous months. ''The German economy is losing some of its momentum,'' he said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists expect Germany, with its aging population, to become a nation of frenzied shoppers. But after years of stagnation, property values are rising in major cities like Berlin and Frankfurt. That tends to make homeowners feel wealthier and more confident about spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, unemployment is near its lowest point since reunification, at 7.4 percent as measured by the Federal Employment Agency. While the rate has been falling for several years, Germans were unsettled by changes to labor laws and are only now feeling secure enough to spend, Mr. Harjes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Structural reforms created a lot of uncertainty,'' Mr. Harjes said. ''People weren't confident enough to see there are also opportunities.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- A main indicator of business sentiment in Europe unexpectedly fell deeper toward recession territory Thursday, compounding concerns about the global recovery after signs of slowing manufacturing in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomy data provided a reminder that, despite the aura of calm in Europe after months of debt-crisis fever, the 17 European Union members that use the euro still have fundamental problems.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major stock indexes in Europe fell broadly Thursday, and the euro slipped against the dollar, after a survey of purchasing managers suggested that growth in the euro zone declined in the first three months of the year. That would be the region's second consecutive quarter of negative growth, which would meet the broad definition of a recession. Stocks were also down in the United States. Reinforcing the survey results, manufacturing orders in the euro zone fell 2.3 percent in January from December, according to a report Thursday by Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. That was a slightly bigger drop than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures suggest that the euro zone is still struggling even after a flood of cash from the European Central Bank helped calm fears of a banking crisis and credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The easing of the sovereign debt crisis has apparently failed to bring about a lasting improvement in business sentiment,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span>, wrote in a note to clients. Reports next week should offer more clues about the direction of the European economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the Ifo Institute in Munich will release its monthly survey of business sentiment in Germany, seen as a reliable indicator of growth in the country, the euro zone's largest economy. On Wednesday, the central bank will release its monthly report on the euro zone's money supply, which economists will watch for signs of a recovery in bank lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by the European Systemic Risk Board, which monitors Europe's financial system, warned that banks remained under pressure as they tried to reduce risky assets and find new sources of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main issue is how to ensure the provision of credit to the economy in the current environment,'' the board said. It includes representatives of the central bank, the European Commission and financial industry regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, weak external and domestic demand continued to weigh on the manufacturing sector in March, a survey released Thursday showed, raising expectations that the Chinese authorities would step up measures to revive economic momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey of purchasing managers in the Chinese factory sector, released by <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, showed that activity declined in March for the fifth consecutive month, as the Chinese economy felt the pain of feeble global economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has become a major market for European products as varied as heavy machinery and luxury goods, so a slowdown there worsens problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary reading in the China survey for March dropped to 48.1 from 49.6 in February. Readings below 50 signal contraction, and even though the reading provides only an early insight into this sector of the Chinese economy, the decline was disappointing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar, which is acutely affected by signs of weakness in China, dropped against the United States dollar after the economic figures were released. Oil and gold prices also declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the purchasing managers' survey, compiled by Markit Economics, slipped to a three-month low of 48.7 in March from 49.3 in February. In that survey, too, a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Markit survey also pointed to a decline in German manufacturing. That is particularly worrisome, because German exports have helped to compensate for sluggishness in Southern Europe as countries like Italy and Spain cut government spending to reduce debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any hope that the manufacturing cycle is turning rapidly in the euro area is dashed by today's numbers,'' Stella Wang, an analyst in London for Nomura, wrote in a note. But she said the figures were unlikely to prompt the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest rate from 1 percent, because inflation remained above the official target of about 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese and euro zone economies are closely linked because many German exports, including cars and heavy machinery, are sold there. China has become the largest market for <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> and other German companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With new export orders sluggish and domestic demand still softening, China's slowdown has yet to finish,'' Xiaoping Ma and Qu Hongbin, economists who follow China for <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist in Hong Kong for <span class="companylink">Credit Agricole</span>, wrote in a research note about the purchasing managers' index, that ''the drop is quite large, especially given that March tends to bring an improvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the reading is likely to reinforce fears of a hard landing for the Chinese economy, Mr. Kowalczyk emphasized that the slowdown in manufacturing activity was expected to be temporary and that he continued to believe China would have a soft landing, with overall growth this year of 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside is that Beijing has a fair amount of firepower it can deploy to stimulate growth. May analysts say they expect the authorities to employ a range of these tools as the year progresses.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks surged on Tuesday, partly a result of positive economic data on the housing sector in the United States and brighter signals from the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the markets were helped by a successful auction of three-month bills in Spain. Also, a report showing improved business sentiment in Germany, Europe's largest economy, offered a glimmer of hope.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average turned positive for the month and bank shares were up more than 3 percent. Over all, it was a reversal of the drag on the entire stock market on Monday, when financial stocks fell by more than 2 percent, partly as focus shifted to a warning by the European Central Bank of a perilous year ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with no stunning news event or resolution to the financial markets' persistent irritants, some questioned the reasons behind the size of the surge on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I cannot explain today's action in the market,'' Gary M. Flam, an equity portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors, said in the final hour of trading. ''There has been no news, either positive or negative, to drive a move of this magnitude. I could try to explain it away, but a move of this magnitude is head-scratching.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 337.32 points, or 2.9 percent, at 12,103.58. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index showed a gain of nearly 3 percent to 1,241.30. The index's 35.95 point gain was the seventh-best of this year. The Nasdaq composite index was up 80.59 points, or 3.2 percent, at 2,603.73.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As stocks soared, investors left the safety of government bonds. The Treasury's 10-year note tumbled 1 2/32, to 100 21/32. The yield rose to 1.93 percent, from 1.81 percent late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts also noted that wild swings were a predictable feature of the end of the year as managers balanced underperforming elements in their portfolios at a time of low trading volume. And even after an impasse over extending a payroll tax cut was announced Tuesday in Washington, the markets held on to their gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market just seems to have no memory from one day to the next,'' Mr. Flam said. ''To drive a move of this magnitude, you would expect there to be some sort of resolution on the bigger-picture issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and the prospects of sluggish economic growth have ganged up on the financial markets in recent months. But the data has sometimes broken through the gloom, pointing to a recovery that is sluggish but at least is not stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday in the United States, government data showed that housing starts in November hit their highest level since April 2010. They reached 685,000, a seasonally adjusted annualized pace surpassing forecasts of 635,000 and up more than 9 percent compared with October. Building permits also exceeded expectations, reaching 681,000, data from the Commerce Department showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a survey released on Tuesday by the Ifo research group in Munich showed that the business climate for trade and industry in Germany, which is Europe's largest economy, continued to improve in December. ''The German economy seems to be successfully countering the downturn in Western Europe,'' the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanley Nabi, the chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that the economic reports in the United States and from Europe showed they were ''not doing as badly as expected, and this morning the housing data came out much stronger than expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to recent higher expectations for growth, he said, ''all of these things combined have given a measure of comfort'' to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed 2.7 percent higher. The major indexes were up 3.1 percent in Germany, 2.7 percent in France and 1 percent in Britain. The German 10-year bond rose 8 basis points to yield 1.95 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the euro zone bond market, where sovereign debt concerns have been overriding, the Spanish auction of three-month bills priced to yield 1.74 percent helped sentiment, an analyst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still a long way from a fix to Europe's problems, but any ease in funding pressures among member economies is certainly a welcomed development,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at <span class="companylink">Morgan Keegan &amp; Company</span>, referring specifically to Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the euro rose and the United States dollar retreated about 0.5 percent on its index, energy and materials stocks on the broader market surged nearly 4 percent. Oil prices rose more than 3.5 percent, with crude for January delivery on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span> at $97.35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> shares, which closed below $5 on Monday, their lowest point since March 2009, were up 3.7 percent Tuesday at $5.17.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment, while still indicating economic growth, declined on Friday, signaling that events in Japan and the Arab world could be making businesses more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ifo Business Climate Index, considered a reliable predictor of growth in the German economy, the largest in Europe, fell to 111.1 from 111.3, the first decline since May 2010. A reading above 100 indicates that the majority of the 7,000 businesses surveyed rate their current situation and expectations for the future as positive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the whole, firms in Germany remain very confident,'' Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, said in the report. ''The business-cycle traffic lights still signal 'green.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was higher than expected and, along with data showing an increase in lending to European business, was not likely to dissuade the European Central Bank from raising the benchmark interest rate next month in a bid to pre-empt inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> noted that the Ifo index showed a decline in expectations for the future even as businesses remained pleased with the current situation. That could be a sign that businesses were worried about the effect of turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa on energy prices, as well as what effect the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan could have on supplies of Japanese-made products like auto parts. About half of the responses to the survey came after the earthquake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The marked decline in the expectation balance provides a first warning signal that business sentiment might be more strongly affected in the coming months if these adverse developments were sustained for much longer,'' <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysts said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergency at the Fukushima nuclear power plants could also add to nervousness among German exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Ifo business climate is clearly in boom territory,'' Jorg Kramer, the <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> chief economist, said in a note. But he added, ''The risks for the forecast are higher than usual. Should the situation in Fukushima escalate, against expectation, and put Tokyo at risk, this would then also affect Western economies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If businesses turn pessimistic, they may be less willing to invest in expansion and to hire more workers. Their reluctance would then cause overall growth in Germany to slow, a problem for all of Europe. Germany has been towing the rest of the Continent through economic turbulence caused by debt problems in Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Friday, the European Central Bank said that lending to business, not including banks and other financial institutions, rose 0.6 percent in February from a year earlier. That is a modest increase and indicates that inflationary pressures in Europe are low, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most analysts expect the E.C.B. to raise its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent from a record low of 1 percent when the bank's governing council meets April 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think the E.C.B. will take comfort from today's Ifo release,'' Jens Sondergaard, an analyst at Nomura, said in a note. ''An E.C.B. rate hike in April is likely.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Bruce Josten, the feisty top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it got personal last fall on a Sunday talk show when President Obama's spokesman invoked his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They called me out'' during a White House attack on the chamber's midterm campaign efforts, Mr. Josten recalled. Mr. Obama had his own reason to take things personally; his policies were on the receiving end of a $50 million ''voter education'' barrage by the chamber, the signature lobby for American business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, both sides have sheathed their weapons. Mr. Obama will address the chamber on Monday as part of a postelection effort to improve relations with business and, he hopes, accelerate economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Josten sees positive signs. The chamber cheered the bipartisan tax cut compromise that Mr. Obama reached with Republicans in the lame-duck session of Congress, the completion of a United States-South Korea trade deal and the recent appointment of William M. Daley, a former business executive, as White House chief of staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The White House does deserve credit,'' Mr. Josten acknowledged. But he is not yet convinced that such steps will tame what he called the ''regulatory tsunami,'' among other problems, enough to stir the investment and the new hiring the administration seeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's all up in the air,'' Mr. Josten concluded. ''You've got to walk the talk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrowed Differences</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relations between corporate leaders and any Democratic president are necessarily fraught. They have different constituencies and worldviews - on the role of government, the distribution of tax burdens and the proper balance between business and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Obama's first two years, business saw costly new health care and financial regulations and a president who denounced the ''obscene'' bonuses of Wall Street ''fat cats.'' Mr. Obama's fellow Democrats saw an administration that eschewed bank nationalization and single-payer health care and usually chose cool pragmatism over hot populism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate leaders ''feared truly punishing legislation and behavior, and in fact they never got it,'' said a Democratic strategist, Jim Jordan. They complain loudly anyway, Mr. Jordan added, for the same reason that top basketball coaches like Mike Krzyzewski of Duke yell at referees: to seek advantage on the next close call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new political alignment of 2011 has narrowed their differences. Having achieved his principal goals on health care and financial regulation (while failing on capping carbon emissions), Mr. Obama has moved toward less polarizing priorities. And Republicans' new strength on Capitol Hill requires that any substantive action have bipartisan support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's set aside ideology,'' said Bernadette Budde, senior vice president at the Business Industry Political Action Committee. ''That's not even the arena in which we're going to play for the next two years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Export promotion, infrastructure development and support for innovation through improvements in research and education all represent goals that business shares with an administration hungry to spur investment and job creation. That agenda may also be appealing to political independents, whose impatience for results drove the swing elections of 2006, 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure from those ''fix-it voters,'' Ms. Budde said, helps elevate the component of Mr. Obama's leadership style that values compromise and inclusiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think I can work with that Obama,'' she concluded. ''If you're in the room, you're going to get something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wary Partners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of the U.S. Chamber, Thomas J. Donohue, was among the first people Gene Sperling called after Mr. Obama named him last month to head the National Economic Council. Among his goals, Mr. Sperling said, is to be ''an honest broker'' who makes sure ''more people are included'' in policy deliberations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, signals like that have had their intended effect. Corporate leaders ''now feel they have a partner,'' said Johanna Schneider, who directs external relations at the Business Roundtable,, an association of nearly 200 leading chief executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has not wiped away differences of interest or mutual suspicions. ''I have no idea,'' Mr. Josten said, what Mr. Obama will tell the chamber on Monday, but he pointed to several specifics that business would like to hear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those include a commitment to complete additional trade deals with Colombia and Panama; steps toward a fundamental overhaul of the tax code; curbs on politically delicate entitlement programs that are needed to close long-term deficits and new financing sources for Mr. Obama's infrastructure goals. Unlike the chamber, the White House has shied away from supporting a gas tax increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Josten dismissed Mr. Obama's recently announced regulatory strategy, ostensibly intended to reduce unnecessary burdens on business. ''It's a rehash of Clinton's, which was a rehash of Carter's,'' Mr. Josten said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such skepticism underscores the limits of rapprochement between Mr. Obama and business organizations in Washington. Nonetheless, they must cope with one another for at least two more years, and maybe six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's their field,'' Mr. Josten said of the administration. But ''we're going to be on the field.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- Despite economic crises in some parts of Europe, things apparently could not be better in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich said its surveys showed confidence among German business in November at the highest level since reunification in 1990.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headline business climate indicator rose to 109.3, from 107.6, much better than market expectations of a flat or slightly lower reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indicator ''is now above the level of the 2006/2007 boom,'' Ifo said in a press release. ''Both the current business situation as well as the business outlook for the coming half year have been assessed more positively by the firms. The upswing in the German economy is gaining more and more strength.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason German businesses are optimistic is that the export sector appears to be holding up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porsche, the sports car maker, reported Wednesday that its sales rose 86.4 percent in its first quarter from a year earlier, when sales were depressed by the financial crisis. It posted revenue of 2.1 billion euros ($2.8 billion), an 80 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BMW</span> and Daimler said this week that they would reduce the Christmas breaks at their factories to meet global demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Statistics Office said Tuesday that the German economy had slowed in the third quarter, expanding by 0.7 percent from the second quarter's 2.3 percent rate, but the data also showed signs that the expansion had moved beyond the narrow manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GfK, a market research firm, said its German consumer sentiment indicator for December showed a sixth consecutive gain, increasing to 5.5 for December from 5.1 in November, which itself was revised upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics in London, wrote in a research note that German exporters had shown few signs of being hit by slowing global demand, and in fact the opposite might be happening because of the euro's decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But we doubt that the resilience of exports will last, even if the euro weakens further,'' she said. ''German exports (and business sentiment) have responded strongly to changes in world demand in the past and our global forecasts point to a very sharp slowdown to come. German exporters cannot rely on Asian demand alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday from Eurostat, the official statistics agency of the European Union, suggested caution was in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for industrial goods for the 16 member nations included in the euro zone fell 3.8 percent in September from August; for all 27 members of the European Union, new orders fell 2.5 percent in September from August. Still, new orders were up by 13.5 percent from a year earlier in the euro zone and by 13.4 percent in the entire union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McKeown said fiscal tightening would constrain any consumer revival, and business and consumer sentiment could suffer as the euro zone bailed out weaker members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Ifo survey suggests Germany will keep driving the euro zone recovery ''in the very near term at least,'' she said, adding: ''We expect the region's largest economy to expand by about 3.5 percent this year before growth slows to about 1.5 percent in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, a report from the Office for National Statistics showed that the British economy expanded by 0.8 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, confirming the initial estimate from October. Gross domestic product grew 2.8 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Corfe, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London, wrote in a note that the figures were in line with market expectations, but said the details revealed ''underlying weaknesses in the U.K. economy, which we believe will bear down on growth over the quarters ahead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, he noted, consumption, investment and government expenditure all slowed in the quarter, pointing to ''frailty in the domestic demand side of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is certainly scope for private demand to disappoint,'' Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays Capital Research, wrote in an analysis. ''However, the recent momentum in private demand provides plenty of headroom for a continued expansion even if these risks crystallize.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear whether the people who would actually be checking in share that excitement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people using location-based services like Foursquare and Gowalla remains small, and does not appear to be growing, according to a report published Thursday by the Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On any given day, 1 percent of adult Americans use a service that allows them to share their location, according to the report. Four percent of adult Internet users use location-based services at all, down from 5 percent of Internet users who said they used such services in May. Only 6 percent of people who use social networking sites also used location-based services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People using location-based services fit the profile of any early adopter of new technologies, said Kathryn Zickuhr, the author of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men were twice as likely as women to use location-based services, and people between 18 and 29 years old were more than twice as likely to use them as any other adult age group. The Pew report did not include data on teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten percent of Hispanics reported using location-based services, compared with 5 percent of blacks and 3 percent of whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zickuhr said she was surprised at how companies building location into their business plans seemed to be far ahead of people using such services in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report's findings may mostly serve as a baseline from which to measure the impact that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will have on location-based services. Pew interviewed 3,001 adults between Aug. 9 and Sept. 13. On Aug. 18, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> introduced Places, which incorporated aspects of Foursquare and Gowalla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is possible that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will help bring location into the mainstream,'' said Ms. Zickuhr, referring to Places. ''It would not be surprising to see if that helps people get used to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> released a series of new features related to its mobile efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pew report notes how quickly technologies like these can go from obscurity to mainstream use. In August 2008, for example, 6 percent of adults used status-updating services like Twitter. By September 2010 that proportion had quadrupled.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A main indicator of consumer and business sentiment in Europe rose more than expected on Thursday, while a public bank that finances private enterprise in ex-Communist countries raised its growth forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two reports, along with a drop in German unemployment, reinforced expectations that Europe and the former Soviet Union were recovering from last year's sharp downturn, though growth was still wobbly in places.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator, which measures confidence among consumers and a broad range of industries, rose 0.5 points in October after rising 0.3 points in September. In the euro area, the index rose 0.9 points for the second month in a row. The index is 104.1 for both regions, above the long-term average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But strong gains in Northern Europe were partly offset by continued pessimism in Spain and other countries in the south that have been the focus of Europe's sovereign debt crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far, the expected growth dip in the euro area has not really materialized,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> in Frankfurt said in a note. But he added, ''tensions are increasing below the surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the public European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, whose largest shareholder is the United States, raised its forecast for economic growth in the 29 so-called transition countries it covers, which extend from Hungary to Mongolia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recovery from the crisis is gradually becoming more broad-based across the region, although it is still fragile in some subregions,'' the bank said in a report. ''Even the recessions in the Baltic states and southeastern Europe appear to be finally bottoming out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in the region will reach 4.2 percent this year and 4.1 percent next year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said. In July, the bank, which also receives financing from Europe and countries including Japan and Australia, predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 3.9 percent next. Last year, output in the region shrank by 5.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countries that suffered double-digit plunges in economic output last year, including Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia and Ukraine, will grow again next year as bank lending resumes and unemployment falls, the bank said. It also raised its growth forecasts for countries like Poland, Romania and Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank left its forecast for Russia next year unchanged at 4.6 percent. It also said there remained big disparities among regions. In Southeastern Europe, which includes the former Yugoslavia as well as Albania, growth will reach only 1.6 percent next year. That is a more optimistic forecast than the bank made in July, but shows that the region is still struggling after output fell 0.6 percent this year and 5.4 percent in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central Asia, including countries like Kazakhstan, will grow the fastest because of higher prices for oil and other commodities, the bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the European Commission sentiment indicator was led by France and the Netherlands, with Germany recording only a modest increase -- another sign that the record growth there this year may be cooling. However, there was other good economic news from Germany on Thursday, as unemployment fell below the three million mark to 7 percent, an 18-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany is cashing in the dividend from changes to labor laws made several years ago, Axel A. Weber, president of the German Bundesbank, said. ''Comprehensive and sometimes painful labor market reforms have helped to make the labor market significantly more flexible,'' Mr. Weber told an audience in Eltville, Germany, according to a release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among business, the biggest improvement in the sentiment indicator was among manufacturers, because of booming exports. Financial services recorded a decline for the second month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Weber and others cautioned that there were still many dangers, like excessive trade deficits or surpluses, that could derail growth. ''While the financial crisis has been associated with a narrowing of imbalances, recent data suggest that this development has started to go into reverse,'' Mr. Weber said. He called on China to allow its currency to fluctuate more to increase domestic demand and compensate for a soaring trade surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erik Berglof, chief economist of the bank, said that some of the problems that had caused a severe economic crisis in Eastern Europe last year, like a dependency on loans denominated in dollars, have eased. But much more work needs to be done, he said. ''There is no room for policy complacency,'' Mr. Berglof said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWICE in the last decade -- in 2002-3 and 2008-9 -- thousands of companies suspended or shrank their 401(k) matching contributions to save money during economic downturns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more recent dropouts are trickling back now, but fewer than half of the companies that shed their match have restored it so far, and many are paying a lower amount than previously. Some companies are considering permanent changes in the way they calculate their share. Consultants and investment managers say it could take at least a year before many employees again get the contribution they received previously -- and many never will.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the caution reflects the uncertain economy. But many companies are rethinking their whole benefits strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a hesitancy to put a match back in this time around, unlike last time,'' said Robert A. Liberto, a senior vice president for Segal Advisors, an investment consulting firm based in New York. ''They don't want to suspend it again in a short period of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have compelling reasons to resume the practice, in which they match, though often not fully, the amount that employees themselves put into their 401(k) plans, up to a specific percentage of salary. <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span> says as many as 9 percent more people join these plans when a match is offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, about 95 percent of plans offer a match (including the 2008-9 suspensions), according to <span class="companylink">Hewitt Associates</span>, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the economy collapsed in fall 2008, approximately 8 percent of plans suspended their match and an additional 1 to 2 percent reduced it, Hewitt says. About 5 percent took similar actions in 2002-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As balance sheets have improved over the last nine months, the matches have reappeared in fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Fidelity surveyed 300 corporate clients in March, it found that 44 percent said they had reinstated their match or planned to. In October, only 27 percent had said so. However, Hewitt found the opposite when it queried 300 companies late last year and again in mid-August: although 80 percent in the first poll had expected to bring their match back in 2010, only about one-third had done so by August. That is a much slower pace than in 2002-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are returning in stages. <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> suspended its match in February 2009, brought it back at half the original level last January and recently announced that it would restore the full contribution next January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the first restoration, ''the economy seemed to be beginning to emerge from the recession, but there was still uncertainty in the global economy,'' Jess Bunn, a <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> spokesman, said. Now, he added, ''our financial performance is considerably stronger, due to an increase in global trade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new matches may not look exactly like the old ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelity clients are tweaking the match formula to provide incentives for employees to save more, said Beth McHugh, the vice president for market insights. Instead of going dollar-for-dollar on the first 3 percent of salary that an employee contributes, for instance, an employer could match half of the first 6 percent. The maximum cost to the company would be the same, but the new formula could spur workers to increase how much they save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more radical potential change is to tie the corporate donation to profitability, rather than giving a fixed percentage. Robert McAree, a senior vice president for Sibson Consulting (a sister company to Segal Advisors), said that as many as one-fourth of the clients that had cut back their match were considering this approach. So are 2 percent of the 60 match-dropping companies surveyed this spring by <span class="companylink">Towers Watson</span>, another benefits consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies that explored the profit-sharing strategy decided against it, said Robyn Credico, a senior retirement consultant in <span class="companylink">Towers Watson</span>'s Alexandria, Va., office. ''It sounded like a good idea, but you have to come up with metrics,'' she said. ''You have to define 'profit.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 2 percent of the respondents in the <span class="companylink">Towers Watson</span> survey expected their match to be permanently smaller, but experts say that even a shrunken or unreliable match is better than none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You should still save in the plan,'' Ms. Credico said, ''because the match is free money, no matter how small it is.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI, India -- In India, waiting in line is not for the soft-elbowed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a line becomes necessary -- say, while boarding a plane -- some dutiful citizens will rise and form its initial trunk. Then, when the trunk appears too long to some, it sprouts branches. People create their own lines by standing next to, say, the fourth person in the trunk and hoping that others line up behind them. This process continues until you have a human evergreen tree, a single-file trunk of tender fools with impatient foliage on both sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a feline quality to standing in Indian lines. Certain parts of the man behind you -- you don't know which -- brush against you in a kind of public square spooning, the better to repel cutters. (Women do less touching.) Still, this is no deterrent to cutters. They hover near the line's middle, holding papers, looking lost in a practiced way, then slip in somewhere close to the front. When confronted, their refrain is predictable: ''Oh, I didn't see the line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a churning India, the line has new resilience. Businesses are becoming vigilant about enforcing queues, and a growing middle class, more well-off and less survivalist, is often less eager to cut. In this way, India's experience seems to feed into a tradition of seeing line etiquette as a marker of modernity, of graduating from chaos to order, whims to rules, brutality to gentility, scarcity to abundance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality may be more complicated, though, for in India and elsewhere, the reigning idea of modernity involves not just an evolution into queuing but also an evolution out. As scrums succumb to queues, queues are succumbing to the free market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the scrum, the queue and the market begins, in most versions, in a Hobbesian state of nature in which the scrum controlled all. People got what they got based on their ability to push and pull, maim and slaughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It required new ideas -- of fairness, equality and the like -- to replace scrums with lines. Internet discussion boards are full of stories about societies that were once terrifying free-for-alls -- that is, until progress, meaning lines, came. The idea has even been printed in the pages of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, in a description of queuing in Hong Kong:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> opened in 1975, customers clumped around the cash registers, shouting orders and waving money over the heads of people in front of them. <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> responded by introducing queue monitors -- young women who channeled customers into orderly lines. Queuing subsequently became a hallmark of Hong Kong's cosmopolitan, middle-class culture. Older residents credit <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> for introducing the queue, a critical element in this social transition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James L. Watson, the Harvard scholar whose research led to the entry, has noted that <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> ''did not, in fact, introduce the queue to Hong Kong.'' But such is the association between globalization and lines in the Hong Kong imagination that the belief stuck, he has written. This line-as-civilization notion is popular among Britons, who sometimes boast that they invented lines. This year, their government announced plans to make aspirants for citizenship answer questions about ''the revered British practice of forming an orderly line for everything from buses to sandwiches,'' as The Daily Telegraph put it. But the line not only speaks of civilization. It also stands for dysfunction: dole lines in recessions and depressions; lines in the Soviet Union to buy basics like meat and toilet paper; lines to get driver's licenses worldwide; lines to register complaints; lines in which slum-dwelling women wait to defecate behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with such lines, humans tend to imagine progress as an escape from linear waiting. As a <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> advertisement put it many years ago, ''Waiting is frustrating, demoralizing, agonizing, aggravating, annoying, time consuming and incredibly expensive.'' Contained in that last word is a hint of <span class="companylink">FedEx</span>'s -- and the modern world's -- solution: the free market. Why wait? Just pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Russian malls rise on the ground where Soviet lines once wound; the more affluent villagers in developing countries buy key-locked portable toilets to avoid the morning queue; governments issue ''rush'' visas so that business travelers can jump the line for a few hundred extra dollars. The line-jumping once reserved for the world's commissars is now a middle-class commodity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see it here in India. Even as it moves toward more orderly lines in some spheres, the line is under attack in others, challenged by the market. The famous Hindu temple in Tirupati, in southern India, now has a regular idol-viewing tour and a V.I.P. one, for those who pay. Even as new nightclubs bring rope-line culture to India, many also sell premium memberships that let you skip the line and walk in. As with lines over scrums, markets have much to offer over lines. They are more efficient. They work well for those fortunate enough to have more disposable money than free time. They mop up much of the daily agony of waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market also changes a culture. A line conceives of people as citizens, presumed equal, each with an identical 24 hours a day to spread among the lines around them. A market conceives of people as consumers, presumed unequal, with those who can pay in front of the others. It allocates efficiently, but it eliminates a feature of line culture: the idea that, in line at least, we are no better than anybody else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, the market's spread is a return to another kind of scrum, one in which financial, and not physical, might means right. Perhaps one day lines will be remembered as antique, a quaint system in which things were granted simply for having shown up early, an interlude of relative equality between the scrums that reigned before and after.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job creation has been disappointing, but first-quarter corporate profits were up 44 percent from a year earlier. Consumers are nervous, but the Dow, which was below 8,000 on the day President Obama was inaugurated, is now over 10,000. In a rational universe, American business would be very happy with Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no. All the buzz lately is that the Obama administration is ''antibusiness.'' And there are widespread claims that fears about taxes, regulation and budget deficits are holding down business spending and blocking economic recovery.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much truth is there to these claims? None. Business spending is indeed low, but no lower than one would have expected given widespread overcapacity and weak consumer spending. Business leaders are feeling unloved, but giving them a group hug won't cure what ails the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask the Obama-is-scaring-business crowd for some actual evidence supporting their claim, and they'll tell you that business spending on plant and equipment is at its lowest level, as a share of G.D.P., in 40 years. What they don't mention is the fact that business investment always falls sharply when the economy is depressed. After all, why should businesses expand their production capacity when they're not selling enough to use the capacity they already have? And in case you haven't noticed, we still have a deeply depressed economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, there has been a close relationship between the level of business investment and the ''output gap,'' the difference between the economy's actual output and its long-run trend -- which means that there's nothing surprising about low investment now, given the fact that the output gap is hugely negative. If anything, it's surprising how well business investment has been holding up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, we can look directly at measures of unused business capacity. Capacity utilization in industry is up over the past year, but still far below historical norms. Vacancy rates at industrial and retail properties are at historic highs. Again, given that businesses have plenty of idle structures and machines, why should they be building or buying even more?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So where's the evidence that an antibusiness climate is depressing spending? The answer, supposedly, is that this is what you hear when you talk to entrepreneurs. But don't believe it. Yes, when you talk to business people they complain about taxes, regulations and the deficit; they always do. But the Obama's-socialist-policies-are-wrecking-the-economy chorus isn't coming from businesses; it's coming from business lobbyists, which isn't at all the same thing. Read the report on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the latest Washington Monthly: peddling scare stories about what Democrats are up to is a large part of what organizations like the chamber do for a living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or read through the latest survey of small business trends by the National Federation for Independent Business, an advocacy group. The commentary at the front of the report is largely a diatribe against government -- ''Washington is applying leeches and performing blood-letting as a cure'' -- and you might naively imagine that this diatribe reflects what the surveyed businesses said. But while a few businesses declared that the political climate was deterring expansion, they were vastly outnumbered by those citing a poor economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charts at the back of the report, showing trends in business perceptions of their ''most important problem,'' are even more revealing. It turns out that business is less concerned about taxes and regulation than during the 1990s, an era of booming investment. Concerns about poor sales, on the other hand, have surged. The weak economy, not fear about government actions, is what's holding investment down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why are we hearing so much about the alleged harm being inflicted by an antibusiness climate? For the most part it's the same old, same old: lobbyists trying to bully Washington into cutting taxes and dismantling regulations, while extracting bigger fees from their clients along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, business leaders are, as I said, feeling unloved: the financial crisis, health insurance scandals, and the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico have taken a toll on their reputation. Somehow, however, rather than blaming their peers for bad behavior, C.E.O.'s blame Mr. Obama for ''demonizing'' business -- by which they apparently mean speaking frankly about the culpability of the guilty parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, C.E.O.'s are people, too -- but soothing their hurt feelings isn't a priority right now, and it has nothing at all to do with promoting economic recovery. If we want stronger business spending, we need to give businesses a reason to spend. And to do that, the government needs to start doing more, not less, to promote overall economic recovery.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOLEDO, Ohio -- Just one day after leaders of the House of Representatives announced a ban on earmarks to profit-making companies, Victoria Kurtz, the vice president for marketing of a small Ohio defense contracting firm, hit on a creative way around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep the taxpayer money flowing, Ms. Kurtz incorporated what she called the Great Lakes Research Center, a nonprofit organization that just happened to specialize in the same kind of work performed by her own company -- and at the same address.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the center -- which intends to sell the Pentagon small hollow metal spheres for body armor that the Defense Department has so far declined to buy in large quantities and may never use -- has $10.4 million in new earmark requests from Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congresswoman, who has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Ms. Kurtz's family and her business's lobbyists, thought the quickly hatched nonprofit organization was a convenient solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They met the requirements of the reform,'' Ms. Kaptur said in an interview. ''Yes, they did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed earmarks are among dozens -- totaling more than $150 million -- from around the country that would indirectly benefit profit-making companies, according to an examination by The New York Times of House appropriation requests submitted after the new rule was imposed in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adopted because of repeated scandals over wasteful spending -- the bridges to nowhere and expensive pet projects like a water-taxi service -- the ban was intended to help eliminate earmark abuses. Critics say spending on earmarks, which added $16 billion to the federal budget last year, diverts money from higher priorities, typically does not require competitive bids and is often directed to experimental research that will never be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given the appeal of free government money, the fees that lobbyists can earn by helping businesses grab a handful of it and the persistence of lawmakers in trying to satisfy constituents or donors, the pay-to-play culture in Washington has once again proved hard to suppress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It reminds me of the line from ''Jurassic Park'' -- 'Life will find a way,' '' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has pushed for nearly a decade to curtail earmarks. ''When you have easy money like this, it finds a way, and members find a way to enable. And that is happening again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ignoring the spirit of the ban, some lawmakers are leaving it up to Congressional committees to block them, a prospect that both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill concede will be near impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No matter what they tell you, there is just no way they can police all that,'' Mr. Flake said. ''They just don't have the time or resources.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative Approaches</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have shown remarkable ingenuity in skirting the rule or veiling their requests through nonprofit organizations, the Times review found. Among the examples:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Virtual Reality Medical Center, a California-based company that sells visual simulation headgear as an experimental form of medical therapy, had sought nearly $6 million in earmarks before the ban. Soon after, company officials instead proposed that the money go to the Interactive Media Institute, a nonprofit group controlled by the center's top executives, which had been set up to sponsor educational conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An aide to Representative Corrine Brown, the Florida Democrat who submitted the request, acknowledged consulting with Virtual Reality executives and then jointly deciding to redirect the earmark. ''The rules were that nonprofits can apply, so a nonprofit did,'' said Lee Footer, a senior legislative assistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pennsylvania, <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> is likely to get as much as 80 percent of a $2 million earmark proposed by Pennsylvania State University for research on clean-burning GE locomotives. At the suggestion of the company and the university's lobbyist, according to a Penn State professor, the university is listed as the lead player in the collaboration instead of GE, as was done previously. GE executives made a series of political contributions to Representative Kathy Dahlkemper, Democrat of Pennsylvania, days after she submitted the earmark request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the Copper Development Association, a nonprofit group controlled by copper manufacturers, is pursuing a $4.1 million earmark to hire suppliers to install its members' copper products in New York City subway cars, asserting that the metal has qualities that inhibit the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a group called the Solar Energy Consortium in Kingston, N.Y., is pursuing nearly $30 million in earmarks, with the help of Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, Democrat of New York. The group, working out of a tiny office above a machine shop, does not perform its own research. Instead, it plans to pass on most of the earmark money to local businesses, some of which directly collected federal earmarks for solar projects this year but would no longer qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profit-making companies were singled out for the earmark ban because their requests, routinely submerged in giant budget bills by their allies in Congress, tended to be more questionable than those sought by nonprofit groups, which include charities, local governments and educational institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Republicans, trying to show their resolve to clean up Congress, pledged not to propose any earmarks this year, though at least three Republicans declined to go along. Democrats have submitted billions of dollars in requests; the exact total is unknown because there is no comprehensive listing of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and Appropriations Committee chairman who announced the ban, declined to comment on the new earmark rule. But his spokesman, Ellis Brachman, said he was unaware of any cases in which profit-making companies had tried to circumvent it or in which House Democrats had assisted them. He added that the panel was committed to finding such cases, if they exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Quick Response</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 9:33 a.m. on the day after Mr. Obey announced the earmark ban, Ms. Kurtz filed the necessary papers with the Ohio secretary of state for her nonprofit organization. She named herself the executive director, and that afternoon, her brother, Daniel K. Wedding, set up a Web site for the organization, even though it had not received the required federal approval to operate as a tax-free entity. With that, they considered the problem of the earmark ban solved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not illegal -- so what?'' said Carol Ann Wedding, who is Ms. Kurtz's sister and the president of Imaging Systems Technology, their family-owned business. She and other family members defend the charity as legitimate, though they offered varying explanations for its purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last four years, Imaging Systems had failed to interest the Pentagon in buying more than a few samples of its hollow metal spheres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeterred, Ms. Kaptur helped the company arrange a total of $8.4 million in earmarks, part of it essentially to force the Defense Department to buy a large order of the metal spheres, which is pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Ms. Kaptur, a 14-term congresswoman, a member of the House Appropriations Committee and a top earmark sponsor, publicly praised the new ban, telling an Ohio newspaper that it ''struck the proper balance between retaining a role for the legislative branch in funding worthy projects and eliminating any potential for abuse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But privately, Ms. Kaptur's office encouraged Ohio companies whose earmark requests were in peril to quickly line up deals with nonprofit organizations. Members of her staff even called University of Toledo administrators to ask about forming partnerships with local defense contractors, said Frank J. Calzonetti, the university's vice president for research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Ms. Kaptur is seeking at least $12 million for the university for programs that this budget year were allocated directly to profit-making companies, with the understanding that the university will pass on most of the money to the companies previously involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of how these collaborations would work were left unresolved, Mr. Calzonetti said, though the university agreed to participate only if it could make a substantive academic contribution. And, he said, the university would get a portion -- at least $70,000 on a $1 million appropriation -- to cover the cost of a faculty member and a researcher to work with the partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the deals involved Nokomis, a Pennsylvania-based defense contractor for which Ms. Kaptur secured a $1.2 million earmark last year. (The company had opened a small office in her district -- a standard courtesy, as were the company-affiliated campaign contributions.) Now, the university would accept the earmark and then funnel most of the money back to Nokomis for that same project -- designing a new type of roadside bomb detector, Mr. Calzonetti confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the companies has a lobbyist to smooth negotiations with officials in Washington. Nokomis, for example, retains Scott Harshman, a former aide to the late Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime Appropriations Committee chairman legendary for securing earmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kurtz's business has a contract with Joseph F. Boessen, a former Armed Services Committee staff member and lobbyist at the PMA Group, a now-defunct firm under investigation over accusations that it traded campaign contributions for earmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy to Oblige</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kaptur said she was pleased that the Ohio defense contractors could form alliances that allowed her office to resubmit the earmark requests. Her first commitment, she said, is to help the Pentagon defend the nation. But if she can deliver government money to local businesses, that is a bonus, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am a member who does fight for my region and my state,'' she said, then adding, ''I don't fight mindlessly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some House members have backed away from the type of requests Ms. Kaptur has championed. Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, for example, refused to request money for a similar collaboration between his state university and a defense contractor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, also withdrew a requested $2 million earmark to the Rochester Institute of Technology, which also had a corporate partner. But she did so only after being contacted by The Times last week. She said that she had misunderstood the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other members said through spokesmen that they were standing by their requests and leaving it up to the House Appropriations Committee to decide if they are acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the earmark requests come from major corporations like <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span>, perhaps best known for its Predator drones. Over the last several years, the company has approached state university officials in Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas about jointly pursuing federal money to accelerate research on its patented technology to convert algae into jet fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under these agreements, about half of the earmark money goes to <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span>, officials involved in the deals said, an arrangement that would continue next year, despite the ban. But in at least one state, Texas, the company's name has been stripped this year from the publicly listed sponsors of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> spokesman, Jim Elliott, declined to comment on the project, which is also supported through competitively awarded grants. ''I don't want to talk about how we get money,'' he said. ''There are a lot of competitors out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal records show that the company has made a series of contributions to the sponsors of the requests, including Representatives Ben Chandler of Kentucky and Solomon P. Ortiz and Ciro D. Rodriguez of Texas, all Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Atomic's university partners defend the projects and their research contributions. But they concede that there is no mystery why <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> would seek local partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You think our congressman is going to write an appropriation request for some San Diego company?'' said Bruce R. Pratt, chairman of the Eastern Kentucky University Department of Agriculture, a partner with <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> on algae research. ''Why would he do that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: The University of Toledo would redirect much of the earmark money to its corporate partners, says Prof. Frank J. Calzonetti. (PHOTOGRAPH BY J.D. POOLEY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A9)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: A Tally of Pet Projects: House Democratic leaders banned earmarks for private companies in March, limiting these Congressionally directed allocations to nonprofit groups, universities or government entities. Despite the ban, many Democrats have submitted requests for earmarks that would indirectly benefit profit-making companies. A sampling:; How One Business Secured Earmarks: Ms. Kaptur has also requested $10.4 million for defense-related research and development at the Great Lakes Research Center in Ohio. The nonprofit agency was created by executives at Imaging Systems Technology, a company whose owners have donated to Ms. Kaptur's campaigns. Ms. Kaptur has sent $8.4 million in earmarks to the firm since 2008. (A9)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Center for Women's Business Research was founded nearly two decades ago by a group of women seeking to win respect for businesses run by women. But even center officials were surprised by the findings in their own report: that those businesses play a significant role in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which was released last month, estimated that eight million businesses -- or 28 percent of all businesses -- were owned by women, and that those businesses created or maintained 16 percent of all jobs in a range of industries like business services, personal services, retail, health care, communications and real estate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Impressive,'' said Gwen Martin, the center's interim executive director. ''It was something many of us knew intuitively. For the first time, we said, 'We're going to figure out how to quantify it.' I think everyone was pleasantly surprised with the results.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Martin said, ''As good as it is, it also points out how much better it could be.'' Only 4.2 percent of all revenue is generated by businesses owned by women in the United States, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with the new research, center officials and other women business leaders are approaching the Obama administration, the Small Business Administration and House and Senate small-business committee members to ask for more resources and new programs to support women-owned businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Barton, executive director of the National Women's Business Council, a bipartisan federal advisory group that helped pay for the research, will be doing the same thing. ''It certainly strengthens our hand,'' Ms. Barton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've never done a study like this before,'' Ms. Barton said of the report, which was also underwritten by <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span>. ''We'd seen anecdotally about the number of women entrepreneurs. This is a confirmation of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic impact report, Ms. Barton said, offers ''recognition on the Hill and in the marketplace that women are doing much more than holding baby-sitting jobs, or proofreading papers or knitting macrame wall hangings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she acknowledged, ''it's the glass half full,'' citing a finding in the report that only 20 percent of women-owned businesses had employees. She said she would like to see those numbers increase. ''We see that as an area of great growth and opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin agreed that that should be a priority. Most private and public programs focus on starting a business, she said. While those programs are still important, she said, ''we need to really teach how to grow a business,'' which requires different skills and motivations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Women really have to fall in love with running a business,'' she said. ''They have to move in to the stage about being excited and motivated by running a business. We need help with that area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letty Hudson, president of Chicago Mini Bus Travel, is a prime example of the owner these groups are trying to spur on. She recently attended a meeting of Women Impacting Public Policy, a national bipartisan nonprofit group, trying to find ways to increase her business activity, which is down this year. While participants learned of the research on women and business, Ms. Hudson was able to share her own experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She spoke of how she had created an ''inner circle'' group of five people whose mission was to make strategic contacts, and of how successful the group had been. ''It's a new way of doing business,'' Ms. Hudson said. ''Let's help each other. Look at our own history and go back and connect people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After she finished, a participant at her table asked her to run a national bus tour. That happened, she said, ''just from me sitting there explaining how we can connect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Business as usual has changed,'' she said. Relationships are now the key, she said. ''This is the new wave on how we change the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hudson runs a business that produces revenue of more than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barton, of the business council, said that she and others were particularly concerned about helping the ''missing middle,'' the majority of business owners who struggle to push annual revenue past $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to continue to look at that point on the spectrum,'' she said. ''We do well starting them out and encourage them at the top with mentoring, but it's the missing middle we need to help nourish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1999, Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence, a nonprofit organization founded by Nell Merlino, who created the Take Our Daughters to Work campaign, has concentrated its efforts on helping businesses owned by women grow. Count Me In runs a program called Make Mine a Million $ Business, which attracts hundreds of businesses each year hoping to reach the $1 million revenue threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter, the leader board -- the program is a yearlong race -- showed that revenue for the top 25 businesses had grown 30 percent from a year earlier and that employment, along with the use of contract workers, had increased 86 percent, Ms. Merlino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in this tough climate, she said, these women are moving forward. ''This tells me that for all the focus the administration has on getting money moving, it is important, but it is not the only thing. It's got to be more about the middle -- it's where the jobs come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason most business don't grow, but particularly women, is they try to do everything themselves,'' Ms. Merlino said. ''Here you have this economic calamity -- the most important thing to do is to hire people.'' With 10 million out of work, she added, there is an extraordinary labor pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colette Chapman, president of Chapman Concierge, based in Morristown, N.J., which works with corporations and residential management companies to provide services to employees and residents, took advantage of that talent this year, hiring a former chief financial officer and a former equities trader. ''Two years ago, I would never found that caliber of employees,'' Ms. Chapman said. ''They would never have consider doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has been good for her in other ways as well, she said, as overworked clients have taken advantage of her residential and corporate concierge services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She joined the Make Mine a Million challenge this year at the $344,000 revenue mark, hoping to raise that to $450,000 or higher. ''I set the bar high,'' Ms. Chapman said. ''We'll be very, very close.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the government said that the nation's gross domestic product, which had been shrinking in the last year, grew by 3.5 percent for the quarter that ended in September. Durable goods orders were up 22.3 percent at an annual rate, housing sales rose 23.4 percent, and in an economic indicator closer to home, there was a contractor in my house on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession may not be over over, especially if you count jobs, but many people may be willing to spend again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you might expect the business press to be striking up the band and restocking the cigar cabinet. Instead, Forbes, a magazine that sells a beau ideal of capitalism, announced last week that it was cutting a quarter of its already decimated staff. The Wall Street Journal's Boston bureau -- historically a hothouse of game-changing business coverage -- is being closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortune magazine had already cut back to 18 issues a year from 25 and this week will be whacking anew at staff along with other <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>. magazines. BusinessWeek was sold for parts to Bloomberg a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, while the business of business may be back, the business of covering it with heroic narratives and upbeat glossy spreads most certainly is not. And probably never will be. There are several technical reasons underlying the collapse -- and that's what it is -- of business journalism. Business wisdom that is imprisoned in printed pages, already locked in the past, increasingly seems like a curio. Who cares what happened yesterday or last week, when the fortunes of a stock can change in millisecond? Most business people already know what happened today, and what they really care about is tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the challenges of covering business in a digital age, the endemic categories of advertising including financial services, insurance and consulting services, and vaporized ad budgets from Detroit, have left once-fat chronicles of the business epoch bereft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't just that Cadillacs aren't selling like they used to. It's also that the people who made them, bought them and drove them seem far more mortal and less interesting than they did just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business magazines used to relish explaining all the complex new financial instruments that Wall Street was using to pile up profits. But now it has become clear that the titans who were wielding those obscure tools had no idea what they were doing -- even less an idea than the journalists in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the fact that they needed billions and billions in taxpayer money to bail them out has left the former Masters of the Universe with all the social cachet of welfare recipients. In fact, people on welfare seem more deserving now that some of the rescued have come roaring back just in time for year-end bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business journalism loves epic scale, but if you want to read a magazine about the biggest player in the financial industry or the auto industry, best pick up an issue of Governing or Congressional Quarterly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much ink was spilled over the years about how business would take off if only government would get out of the way, but now all the salient conversation is on increased regulation and oversight. And bureaucrats in full frolic will never be an editorial match for guys who leave the office in helicopters to reach houses that should have their own ZIP code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the public has lost its appetite for stories about handsome men in three-piece suits who clink whiskey glasses at the end of a long, not-so-hard day while talking smack about their female co-workers. But ''Mad Men'' pretty much sates that need. The businessman as Colossus is by now a nostalgic impulse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we see a close-up of Crockett &amp; Jones lace-ups, we realize that they often are inhabited by manifest feet of clay and find ourselves wondering whether the taxpayers paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just business that has changed, it is the idea of business. For decades, it was the best minds that American business schools produced, along with bootstrapping savants, crossing swords with the invisible hand and coming away winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the consequences are removed from the equation and the feds are there to cushion any downside, riding the upside seems less magical. Writers and editors who cover business now know that the jig is up, that those bespoke suits are put on one leg at a time by men that seem far less Olympian than they once did. Even Warren Buffett, the oracle of both business and Omaha, has gotten pushed around by an economy full of trap doors, unforeseen consequences and head feints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exceptions. <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Apple. Twitter (assuming it ever makes money). But the editorial tropes of financial might don't easily describe the nature of their accomplishment. How hot and bothered is a reader supposed to get about an algorithm? And no one wants to read a magazine about the sovereign funds, foreign investors and bargain hunters from afar who seem to be the real power in buying in at the bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business coverage has been, at its heart, aspirational, a brand promise that suggests that if you clip the right articles, internalize the right rhetoric, then you too will end up as one of the shiny, happy people striding boldly across the pages of magazines with names like Fortune, Money, Fast Company and Wired. But nobody is going to read, let alone aspire to, magazines called Middled, Outsourced, Left Behind and Clobbered. It's as if American business has lost custody of its own story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exuberance, irrational and otherwise, will most likely return at some point, just as it always has. But people could be forgiven for not believing in business, or business news, the way they used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a recovery is under way, most Average Joes are not buying in or benefiting so far. On Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending actually dropped in September, the first time it had gone down in five months, and the Dow buckled 2.5 percent at the end of trading last week. Consumers clearly lack confidence in the recovery, and, by extension, the people who are supposed to make it happen. And doubt doesn't sell magazines.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British economy remained mired in recession during the third quarter, according to data released Friday. That stood in stark contrast to the countries using the euro, where reports showed steadily improving activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A significant reason for the divergent performance appears to be the larger debt burden of British consumers, analysts said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary report from the Office of National Statistics in London showed that gross domestic product contracted by 0.4 percent from July through September from the previous three months, and it shrank by 5.2 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British economy has now shrunk for six successive quarters, making this the longest downturn since the agency started tracking such data in 1955.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected growth of 0.2 percent for the quarter, based on recent improvements in housing statistics, purchasing managers' indexes and the wilting pound, which should make exports more competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report showed weakness in the service sector, where output fell 0.2 percent; industrial production, down 0.7 percent; and construction, off 1.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain is starting to further lag behind the 16-member euro area, where France and Germany are leading steady improvements in manufacturing, services and consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean-Michel Six, chief European economist at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, cited consumer indebtedness as the main factor undermining a recovery in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''U.K. consumers are coming out of a period of very significant leveraging, and the process of unwinding that is long and painful,'' he said. ''You would expect savings rates to grow and credit demand to fall, weighing on the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, German business confidence in October rose to its highest level in 13 months, according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its business climate index, which surveys 7,000 executives, rose to 91.9, from 91.3 in September. The index touched a recent low of 82.2 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The third quarter was a good quarter for the German economy,'' said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING. ''Probably even an excellent quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said German companies were benefiting from the pickup in global activity, stock rebuilding, stimulus-driven private consumption and tax relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, from the data firm Markit, showed that a composite index of manufacturing and services industries in the euro area improved to 53 in October, from 51.1 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading was the highest in 22 months, Markit said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said the data indicated that the euro-zone economy had entered the fourth quarter on a strong note and were consistent with gross domestic product rising at a quarterly rate of around 0.4 percent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, the national statistics office, Insee, said that consumer spending jumped 2.3 percent in September from August, well above expectations of a 0.5 percent rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another release Friday, from the European Union data agency Eurostat, showed that industrial orders in the euro area increased by 2 percent in August from July, but were down 23.1 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Six of S.&amp; P. cautioned that smaller euro-area economies like Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal had not shown the resilience of the two largest members of the currency bloc.</p>

Young Japanese, in particular, feel apathy and bewilderment. They came of age in Japan's lost decade of economic stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Internet research company Macromill asked 500 20-year-olds whether they would describe Japan's future as ''bright'' or ''dark,'' 82 percent chose dark. Japanese executives are the most pessimistic in the world, according to a recent cross-cultural survey that scored responses from 7,200 respondents on the outlook for their businesses in the short term.</p>

''And a society that loses hope loses the will to try to make things better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a spectacular rise and fall for Japan. At the end of World War II in 1945, the country lay in ruins, hardly able to feed itself and relying on emergency shipments of food and supplies from the occupying United States Army.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1968, Japan's economy was on a road to rapid recovery, overtaking West Germany to jump to No. 2 in the world under the wing of its ally and biggest trading partner, the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth slowed somewhat after the oil supply shocks of the 1970s. But into the late 1980s, the world was awash with Japanese money as corporations snapped up prime real estate like Rockefeller Center in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remembering the good times, retiring baby boomers are nostalgic for the glorious past. Indeed, bars, restaurants and even small theme parks recreating motifs from the Showa era -- the period of the previous emperor's reign from 1926 to 1989 -- have popped up all over the country, serving retro beers and displaying posters of long-gone movie stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Japan had good times. We all worked hard, and companies only knew how to grow,'' said Atsushi Kachi, drink in hand at the Nippon Saisei Sakaba, a 1950s-era restaurant in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo that serves grilled meats and beers of the age. ''Back then, people believed their lives would get better,'' said Mr. Kachi, 59, who works for a trading company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese familiar with World War II and its disastrous aftermath have a different perspective. Japan may soon be eclipsed by China, said Masaru Mizuno, 77, a longtime bureaucrat who once ran <span class="companylink">Japan Tobacco</span>, one of Japan's largest companies. ''But it is not as if we will go back to an era of mass starvation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overall size of the economy does not matter. The lives of ordinary Japanese have so improved in the last few decades,'' Mr. Mizuno said. ''What is there to complain about?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe a large potential customer you have been chasing finally comes through with a huge order -- and then orders again and again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or many of your smaller clients fell away in the recent economic downturn.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the reason, when you examine where your revenue is coming from, you may discover that one or two customers are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of your sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger with that is obvious. Should they suddenly stop doing business with you, your company could suffer. Drastically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can you guard against this situation? Here are some pointers that could help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WARNING SIGNS The National Federation of Independent Business understands the appeal of attracting customers who have the ability to give you substantial sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the foundation for long-term growth and stability. When you have customers you can count on month after month, the secure cash flow gives the opportunity to consider expanding in new directions and tapping new markets,'' they write.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how do you know if a customer has become too important to you? The federation offers these two crucial warning signs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When one customer is responsible for 30 percent or more of your revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If cash flow would be badly disrupted if one customer were to suddenly cancel all orders or even cut back sharply. ''Expenses would continue, but suddenly there wouldn't be enough to cover them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PREVENTIVE MEASURES If you are in an industry where there are only a few major competitors, limiting your dependence on one company may be extremely difficult, Suzanne Caplan points out on Entrepreneur.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that case, you obviously need to watch the financial health of your customer very carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If payments get slower, take some action. If the company is big enough, the accounting side does not talk to the purchasing side, so you won't lose the business. Anyway, if you're not going to get paid, you don't want the sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLAN B One way to reduce the anxiety of losing a large customer is to prepare for it. In other words, you need a backup plan, Stephanie Migot writes on her blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recognize that unless you are supplying a unique product or service, the customer can readily go elsewhere. ''The trick, she says, ''is to be like a flirtatious paramour: make it clear that you are willing to work, but be clear that they are not your only prospect. It is perfectly acceptable to prioritize those customers who provide the best pay, or the most regular orders, but you need to take care not to neglect the customers who may provide less lucrative or frequent revenue streams. It's nice to feel needed, but it is also a very precarious position to be in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LESSON When it is comes to the potential mixed blessing of having one large customer, Rhonda Abrams, small-business consultant, sums up your options nicely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure, you have to serve that one big customer,'' she says. ''But while earning a good income from that one customer, you have two choices: grow your business and diversify your customer base or start putting away substantial sums of money in case that customer disappears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST CALL How can you tell if a big customer you have depended on is running into financial trouble? BasicJokes.com offers one -- hopefully tongue in cheek -- example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A customer sent an order to a distributor for a large amount of goods totaling a great deal of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The distributor noticed that the customer's previous bill hadn't been paid. The collections manager left a voice mail for them saying, 'We can't ship your new order until you pay for the last one.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next day the collections manager received a collect phone call, 'Please cancel the order. We can't wait that long.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAQUBA, Iraq -- The Diyala State Company for Electrical Industries here staggers along, making transformers, spark plugs, ceiling fans and steam irons that few want or can afford anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its labor force has tripled in size, even as production has slumped. A deal to lure $60 million in foreign capital -- one of only a handful of foreign investments in Iraq's state-owned industries -- collapsed. The American government recently gave the company $2.5 million to keep its main production line operating and its workers out of penury and, perhaps, insurgency.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month the United States and Iraq will gather hundreds of officials and company executives for a two-day conference in Washington intended to send a message that after six years of war, Iraq is open for business, and not just in oil. Now more than ever before, Iraqi officials boast that a trickle of foreign investment -- including the first new hotel in Baghdad since Saddam Hussein's government fell -- is at last poised to be a flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of the company here, though, shows that economic development and foreign investment face more obstacles than security alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-owned industries that dominate the country's economy -- from oil fields to dairies to textile factories -- are as bloated and inefficient as they were in Mr. Hussein's time, arguably more so. They are hobbled by corruption, still sporadic electricity and poor roads and bound by bureaucracy and central planning that leave them unable to compete with a flood of cheap imports from Iran, Turkey and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New legislation intended to regulate investments, land rights, taxes, financial services and consumer protections remains stalled in Parliament. The mere mention of the sort of privatization that swept Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of Communism is anathema to officials here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not after shock therapy,'' Sami al-Araji, the chairman of Iraq's national investment commission, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are after a gradual change from a centrally controlled economy to an open one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki publicly pressed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier this month about ''the need for this conference to be a success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately, though, American officials express concern that it will be little more than a political exercise before Mr. Maliki's re-election campaign unless the Iraqis do more to create a solid foundation for foreign investors willing to take a risk on the country's prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Biden, in his meetings with Mr. Maliki and other senior leaders, stressed the need for better regulatory and financial systems, according to a senior official traveling with him. The official said that reforms would, for example, allow the <span class="companylink">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</span> to extend loan guarantees to American companies interested in investing in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few, though, expect the legislation to proceed before next year's parliamentary elections and the inevitable political bargaining that will follow, putting off significant reforms, and thus investment, for at least a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capital is cowardly,'' said Mejul Mahdi Ali, the president of Diyala's newly created investment commission. ''It is always looking for a safe place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he spoke, an explosion reverberated through Baquba; a roadside bomb killed three police officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ali complained that many government ministers showed little interest in foreign or private investment, or actively opposed it. The commission was kicked out of two government offices before moving to a shabby villa, equipped not by the provincial government, but the American reconstruction team at Forward Operating Base Warhorse, which is nearby. He has not been paid in three months, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government's idea of economic development, he said, is a plan to buy 10,000 taxis and lease them to drivers, against his advice. Baquba might soon be the easiest place in the world to catch a cab, but he said, ''That's not investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even with uncertain security and insufficient legal protections, Iraq has started attracting the attention of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Daimler AG</span> signed an agreement with Iraq last year and opened an office in Baghdad. Case New Holland, the international tractor maker, began building the first of 1,250 tractors for the Iraqi government at a factory in Iskandariya, once a center of the insurgency in an area south of Baghdad known as the ''triangle of death.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers broke ground in July on a high-end $100 million hotel near the ''crossed swords'' monument in Baghdad's international zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Potential investors have a virtual open landscape to develop projects that will fill the needs of Iraq's expanding and demanding population,'' Dr. Araji of the national investment commission wrote in an investors guide published this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism has been premature before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Industry last year solicited bids for more than 40 projects involving partnerships with state-owned enterprises, but received them for only 11. Most of those have since failed to come to fruition, including the $60 million proposal for the electrical company here in Baquba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plant, with eight separate factories, was originally built in 1982 and equipped with machines by Mitsubishi that are now out of date. They still function only because workers have cannibalized parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the war in Diyala was at its worst in 2007, the company shut down; the Islamic Army of Iraq, one of the leading insurgent factions, established its headquarters nearby. The director, Abdul Wadoud al-Sattar Mahmoud, went into hiding; his personal assistant was killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The violence ultimately eased, and the factory began to operate again, though largely with the help of the American reconstruction team at Warhorse and the Task Force for Business Stability Operations, a Pentagon agency that supports economic development in Iraq. The task force's function has been to restore production at Iraq's state-owned enterprises, after American officials initially sought to shut them immediately after the invasion in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by the task force in 2007 criticized the factory's management and described the factory's ''most insidious'' problem as ''a general lack of industriousness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government policies have not helped make it profitable either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Industry has vastly expanded its payroll to 3,400 workers, compared with 1,200 after the invasion, and raised salaries, driving up the costs of its products. At the same time, a decision by the Coalition Provisional Authority to lower customs duties has meant cheaper foreign products. The factory now has 12,000 unsold ceiling fans and one million spark plugs stored in its warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahmoud said that while one ministry drove up costs, another, the Ministry of Electricity, complained that it could buy cheaper transformers from abroad. ''The competition here is very difficult for me,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqi law forbids foreign companies from owning equity in state-owned enterprises. The Ministry of Industry also forbids wholesale restructuring of companies that would require dismissing workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even worse, in the case of the factory here, when the Ministry of Industry initialed the $60 million investment deal with an Egyptian-Iraqi consortium last year, it suspended its subsidies for the steel needed to make electrical transformers, potentially its most lucrative product in a country starved for power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consortium, however, pulled out of the deal earlier this year -- because of the general international economic crisis, officials said -- and the supply of steel necessary to keep production going dwindled. The production line would have ground to a halt if the Americans had not stepped in with the grant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could produce more if we had raw materials,'' the line's manager, Abdul Salam Mohammed, said plaintively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The director, Mr. Mahmoud, has begun to personally lobby provincial governments for business, deeply discounting the transformers and worsening the company's losses, something he never had to do before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a new experience for us,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Gradual stabilization in some economies, a muted recovery in others and a long way to go over all -- that was the picture painted by a cluster of data from Asia on Wednesday after the remarkable slowdown of the last few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, the closely watched Tankan survey of big manufacturers, conducted quarterly by the Bank of Japan, bounced back in June from a record low in March, coming in at minus 48, the bank announced Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, an official purchasing managers' index rose for a fourth consecutive month in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And South Korea reported that exports in June were 11.3 percent lower than a year earlier, a much smaller decline than the surprisingly poor 28.5 percent fall recorded in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe the current recovery has been confirmed and can be sustained,'' said Fan Gang, an economist who advises the Chinese central bank, Reuters reported. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, however, said that the government remained cautious about the economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, the Tankan business survey rebounded, but to a much lower reading than economists had expected. While the reading was better than the minus 58 registered three months ago, it remained a negative reading indicating that pessimists still outnumbered optimists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the survey also showed that businesses had become even warier about plans to purchase machinery and other items, suggesting that many would make more layoffs and cut costs as they braced for a prolonged downturn in foreign demand for goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big manufacturers surveyed in the June Tankan said they planned to cut capital spending by 24.3 percent in the year that began April 1. In the March survey, the estimate was 13.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The massive fall in capital expenditure plans has dispelled any optimism about the speed of recovery in Japan,'' said Glenn Maguire, an economist at <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a briefing in Paris, Takatoshi Ito, a University of Tokyo economics professor and a former finance ministry official, said, ''We are nowhere near declaring that we are past the bottom -- that the worst is over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the recovery in the purchasing managers index in China was muted, while a similar index in India slipped to 55.3 in June, from 55.7 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the United States and Europe, the indexes have been above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for several months, showing both countries' relative resilience in the face of the global downturn. The June index for the euro zone, also released Wednesday, rose to 42.6, from 40.7 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, the June reading moved up only slightly, to 53.2 in June, from 53.1 in May. A separate index compiled by the brokerage firm CLSA rose to 51.8, from 51.2 in June, its highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rises reflect big stimulus expenditures in China, which has more leeway than governments elsewhere to pump money into the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Beijing announced a two-year spending program worth 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) which, combined with rate cuts and soaring lending by banks, have propped up the economy and helped offset the impact of falling exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the third straight month in which firms' order books have improved, following a period of contraction that lasted eight months,'' CLSA said in a note accompanying its survey Wednesday, adding that the data also showed that foreign orders had risen for the first time in 11 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But CLSA also struck a note of caution, echoing many economists' warnings that recent global data signaled mere stabilization at this stage, rather than all-out recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists also worry that recent signs of improvement in parts of Asia may be tied to one-time effects like improved credit conditions and the restocking of inventories by companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unfreezing in credit conditions helped provide a boost in recent months,'' said Mr. Maguire of <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span>. ''But we will need a recovery in final demand in Western economies for that to be sustained.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A picture caption on Wednesday with an article about foreign banks capitalizing on financial turmoil in the United States to increase their business misidentified the job held by Paul Calello of Credit Suisse, one of the banks that are challenging American banks. He is head of Credit Suisse's investment bank -- not head of investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Jun 20 2009 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's great investment houses have never faced a serious foreign challenge in their own backyard. But as tectonic shifts reverberate through the banking industry, their overseas rivals are edging into some of the most lucrative corners of American finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss, Germans, British and Japanese are grabbing business from once-swaggering American banks by taking companies public, underwriting new bonds and advising corporations on mergers and acquisitions. And they are hiring more of their rivals' bankers and traders to continue their winning streak.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while big American banks still tower over global finance, the latest shift, although subtle, is raising some uncomfortable questions, including the big one: Could foreign banks one day do to Wall Street what Japan once did to Detroit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is evidence of traction in market share, and you can see that these banks have leapfrogged,'' said Fiona Swaffield, an analyst at Execution Ltd., a brokerage firm based in London. ''The issue is, how long can this last, and can anyone re-emerge?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last decade, the strongest overseas rivals have tried to climb above their American competitors, often with mixed success. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> of Switzerland sought to become a universal banking powerhouse with its purchase of the United States investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in 2000, only to see the merger sour. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> of Germany tried to do the same with a 1998 merger with Bankers Trust, and met with similar troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, foreign banks have become increasingly aggressive in such activities as debt and equity underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. Ten years ago, for instance, only one bank, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, ranked among the top 10 debt underwriters. This year, four foreign banks crowd the field. Similarly, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> and <span class="companylink">UBS</span> now list among the top 10 global M.&amp; A. advisers. A decade ago, the only non-United States firm was <span class="companylink">Dresdner Kleinwort</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, overseas banks have hoped to capitalize on the turmoil convulsing the financial industry. The demise of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, two of the oldest names on Wall Street, gave them a rare opportunity to press for advantage. So did messy distractions like <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s fraught takeover of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. Meanwhile, many foreign banks have fortified their finances at their regulators' behest, while avoiding the restrictions and stress tests required of many American rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even as American banks start to return to health, efforts by the Obama administration to rein in the industry are likely to shift the competitive landscape in new ways -- a development closely watched by foreign contenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What worries me is the competitive edge that non-U.S. banks have vis a vis U.S. banks,'' said Eugene A. Ludwig, the comptroller of the currency under President Bill Clinton, who now runs the Promontory Financial Group, a Washington bank consultant group. ''Non-U.S. banks generally operate under more coherent regulatory structures than U.S. banks do, which creates imbalances that non-U.S. banks can exploit, especially at a time when their U.S. counterparts are operating under extraordinary constraints.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nine months since it snapped up Lehman's core operations at a bargain-basement price, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, already one of the biggest risk management and financing firms in Europe, has jumped from a minor player to a major firm in the capital markets business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction was a rare chance for Robert E. Diamond Jr., the American president of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, to take on rivals like <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. It brought the British bank business it never had in equities, M.&amp; A. and equity research, while shoring up its debt underwriting and trading business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> almost doubled its United States work force overnight by buying the remnants of Lehman, the British bank has jumped to second place in global debt underwriting. It is No. 4 in America, with nearly a tenth of the market, more than <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> or <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. This year alone, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> advised on $90 billion of mergers and acquisitions on this side of the Atlantic, more than <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and on par with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, although it still trails the most powerful players, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are one of the few Wall Street firms focused on building this year versus consolidating,'' said Jerry del Missier, president of <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, the biggest German bank, has had expansion in the United States ''in sight since we bought Bankers Trust in 1998,'' said Seth Waugh, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> Americas. ''We expect to win market share'' in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, trading and wealth management, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, it has gained lucrative prime brokerage business from hedge funds. And it has made strides in mergers and acquisitions, moving to fifth place globally in the first five months of this year, although it is still in only 11th place in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters. The bank recently added 90 new senior employees to its United States staff of more than 12,000 to broaden operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> has also wrested prime brokerage business from rivals while stepping up its United States activity in investment-grade corporate debt, earning $20 billion in the first five months, compared with $29 billion for <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. The second-largest Swiss bank gained ground after cutting costs, curbing risky activities and selling billions of dollars in problem assets to cleanse its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, said the bank's decision to refuse Swiss government support had given it strategic flexibility compared with its American competitors, which might remain restrained in how they expand or spend their money overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the bank has slipped in at least one field it used to dominate: high-yield capital markets, where it fell to seventh place in the first quarter behind <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, according to Thomson Reuters. But Mr. Dougan is continuing his push to bolster <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s overall business by aggressively hiring top talent from the investment and private banking divisions of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, Lehman, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. The bank is also considering a ''tactical acquisition'' in private banking to siphon even more business from rivals, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we have an opportunity to increase, to really, really increase our position,'' said Mr. Dougan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Japanese are muscling in on Wall Street's turf. Nomura has added about 135 people in the United States since October, mainly in its equities division, augmenting its American work force by 10 percent and moving its global business head to New York, in a sign of the potential it sees.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may seem counterintuitive that in the midst of this global economic crisis a substantial number of entrepreneurs, investors and venture capital financiers are interested in starting a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that appears to be the case in Southern California. Two senior biotechnology executives are starting a pharmaceutical company, for example. In another case, a software manager is raising fresh capital to finance the expansion of a new product. A longtime Internet entrepreneur is starting a new company. And a venture capital company in Los Angeles is raising money for an 18-month-old fund to invest in small private companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody denies that obtaining financing is difficult these days, but more than 250 people showed up at a Caltech/MIT Enterprise Forum in January to hear experts offer what was described as ''Critical Insights on Building a Successful Venture in Challenging Times.'' The forum was established about 25 years ago, to encourage technology ventures in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the Los Angeles Venture Association expects more than 1,000 people to attend its investment forum on ''Growing Companies in an Economic Downturn,'' which it is holding in Anaheim with the Harvard Business School Alumni Association of Orange County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help finance their start-up, Cure Pharmaceutical L.L.C., two former executives at <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> are putting in their own money while they seek grants from foundations. Their plan is to help develop drugs to combat diseases in developing countries, including H.I.V. and AIDS, hepatitis C and malaria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up is another step in a personal quest by Edward E. Bjurstrom, Cure's co-founder and president. He said he left his job as vice president of <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> for worldwide manufacturing in 2005 because ''I wanted to do something meaningful to address the needs of developing countries'' for access to advanced medicines. Mr. Bjurstrom said he first started a charitable foundation, CareNow, and then founded Cure with Edward G. Maliski, a research and development executive who had left <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> in a corporate restructuring in 2007. ''The financial package offered by <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> made Cure possible,'' Mr. Maliski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new company relies on compounds developed by Dr. Mladen Trkovnik of Zagreb, Croatia, that Cure Pharmaceutical licensed in September. ''Our purpose is to bring them into broader development and testing in developing countries,'' Mr. Bjurstrom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the new company has a pledge of financing for work on H.I.V.-related medicines from the Joshua W. Lavender Foundation, which brought Dr. Trkovnik's work to Mr. Bjurstrom's attention. Cure Pharmaceutical has also applied for a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for its work on drugs to combat hepatitis C. The company is also pursuing drugs to combat malaria in children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bjurstrom estimates that Cure will need $3 million over the next two years to develop and test drugs in developing countries. The company is hoping to have about a dozen full-time employees, said Mr. Maliski, the chief operating officer, along with contract workers. ''A tremendous amount of underutilized talent is available to work on contract,'' Mr. Maliski said. ''And laboratory space is abundant to be rented out on contract.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Bjurstrom said, full Food and Drug Administration trials in the United States will require finances of more than $10 million. For that, Cure will seek a partnership with a large pharmaceutical company or sell out to one, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second company that is trying to take advantage of the weak economy is Big Stage Entertainment, a two-year-old company that produces three-dimensional software allowing users to integrate their own images, or avatars, into movie scenes, television shows, video games and social networks. Phil Ressler, the company's new president, has just raised $3 million from backers. The company had already received almost $8 million in venture financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Stage's technology grew out of government-sponsored research into facial recognition software at the University of Southern California, which licensed it to Big Stage for commercial development. ''We launched the product in September and took in $60,000 in the fourth quarter,'' said Mr. Ressler, who became chief executive in July. Initial customers have been using the technology for online business promotions and video conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was raising the additional capital from <span class="companylink">Mission Ventures</span>, Tech Coast Angels investors and others, he said, ''because in bad times you have to move forward; you can't save your way to success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ressler says he is hoping that Big Stage takes in $2.9 million in 2009 and hits subsequent revenue targets in 2010 and beyond. If the business fails to meet his targets, he said, he will advise backers to sell the company. ''But I want to sell a business that is still writing orders, not one that's stalled out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jake Winebaum said he was starting an Internet company but could not discuss specifics yet. Mr. Winebaum was one of the organizers of eCompanies.com, an incubator for start-ups in the dot-com boom of 2000. When the boom collapsed, Mr. Winebaum led Business.com through lean years and successful ones as an online marketplace for referrals to business services and products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From the start, even when things looked bad in 2001, I had entrepreneurs logging on, asking us to find this kind of insurance company or that kind of manufacturing part,'' Mr. Winebaum said. He said he sold Business.com in July 2007 for $345 million to the <span class="companylink">R. H. Donnelley Corporation</span>, the publisher of Yellow Pages directories, and left that company in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he is planning a new company. ''The Internet will continue to develop at the center of all media and business over the next two years,'' Mr. Winebaum said in an interview. ''So the time to start a company is now, when there is less competition because few people are starting businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''I can put up some of my own money and raise capital from other investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank R. Kline, managing partner of <span class="companylink">Kline Hawkes &amp; Company</span>, a venture capital firm in Los Angeles, has a similar conviction that now is a time to start something. Kline Hawkes, which has invested $300 million in 44 companies in the last 15 years, sold one its investments, Cyalume Light Technologies, to a special-purpose acquisition corporation last year for $120 million, Mr. Kline said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he expected more sales of small companies. So Kline Hawkes is raising money for KH Growth Equity, a relatively new fund that aims to invest up to $15 million to help small companies expand in the expectation that there will come a time to sell the businesses. ''There will be change of control, owners will be selling out, moving on,'' Mr. Kline said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- This city's reputation as freewheeling and anything goes may have made it the champion of convention markets. But the city's image -- so successfully cultivated in the ''What Happens Here, Stays Here'' advertising campaign -- is not squaring with the new era of fiscal restraint brought on by the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rash of conference cancellations, and a presidential admonishment peppered with a Las Vegas reference last week, has unnerved politicians and resort executives who are fearful that the all-important convention industry could be on the verge of collapse.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly a moment we should all pay great attention to,'' said Jan L. Jones, senior vice president for <span class="companylink">Harrah's Entertainment</span>, which had a 30 percent decline in convention business in January compared with a year ago at its seven resorts on the Strip. ''Las Vegas has long tried to balance the image of party town, serious town. This is an opportunity for us to remind business why they do business here, and it's because it's the best value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last month, 30,000 hotel room nights booked for conferences have been canceled at an estimated loss of $20 million to the city, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those rooms were reserved for a <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> technology conference, which was moved to San Francisco this month. And the figures do not include 17,000 people who were expected to attend a State Farm agents' convention this October. That conference was canceled Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had already seen a 4 percent drop in visitors in 2008 from the year before and a decline of 6 percent in the number of conventions and events held here in that same period. The number of visitors was down 11 percent in December from a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another conference cancellation came from the Automotive Market Research Council, which was supposed to meet at the <span class="companylink">Planet Hollywood</span> resort in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought it would be a harder sell for our members to get approval'' to go to a Las Vegas event right now, said Darren Green, vice president of the group. Mr. Green said the event had been called off as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety over the matter escalated last week after President Obama told an audience in Elkhart, Ind., that companies ''can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer's dime.'' The remark was taken by many here as an attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mayor heard the words 'Las Vegas' -- he didn't hear any other city -- and people are telling me that they're not coming to Las Vegas because the president doesn't want them to,'' said Mayor Oscar B. Goodman, who at first demanded a White House apology but later in the week said he just wanted a clarification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's an impression out there,'' Mr. Goodman said, ''that somehow if you come to Las Vegas, it's going to reflect on your business culture, and that's a bunch of hooey.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House has not commented directly on the matter. But the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said on the Senate floor Wednesday that Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, had told him that ''the president's criticism was aimed at the potential use of taxpayer funds for junkets and in no way reflects his thoughts about any one particular city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman and local meeting planners insist that they have heard from companies who said Mr. Obama's remarks scared them away, but Ms. Jones, the <span class="companylink">Harrah's</span> executive, said no company had made that connection while talking to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation that has particularly rankled Las Vegas was the one by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, which received $10 billion in bailout money. The company issued a statement saying the decision was ''based on our best efforts to operate according to the requirements of the new landscape of our industry,'' but a $600,000 cancellation fee charged by the hotel has led some to question that explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it was a public relations move,'' Ms. Jones said. ''Why would you pay a cancellation fee and go to a city that's more expensive to get there and where the cost of food is more expensive because you don't have as many options?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no way that that ended up less money, and if the issue is really a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, doesn't that mean you look for the best value which is the lowest price?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Las Vegas on the defense, competing destinations sense an opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Theis, executive vice president of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, said he planned to point out to meeting planners that ''people aren't going to raise their eyebrows'' about a company holding an event in his city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now more than ever, it's going to be in our favor that glitz and what's new this week in Vegas isn't going to resonate to the show managers at a time when everyone's being scrutinized,'' Mr. Theis said. ''When you take out the casinos and all the recycled chefs, what else do you really have there? Splash has a limited shelf life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jones zinged back: ''They can be licking their chops, but the minute we tell our story, they can't compete. Ever. Counting Las Vegas down and out, given the entrepreneurial spirit at work here, is just foolish.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANTWERP, Belgium -- Teetering on their bicycles or strolling amiably while chattering into cellphones in Yiddish, Dutch, French, Hebrew or English, the Orthodox Jews of this Belgian port city have set the tone of its lively diamond market for more than a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoveniersstraat, or Gardener's Street, is the backbone of the market, where four-fifths of the world's uncut diamonds are traded. It winds past the L &amp; A Jewelry Factory and the office of Brinks, the armored car company, and on to the World Diamond Center just opposite the little Sephardic synagogue. On any given day but Friday, it is sprinkled liberally with Orthodox Jewish diamond traders, many of them Hasidim.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today their livelihoods, perhaps even their way of life, are beginning to seem threatened as foreigners move in, most notably Indians, but also Lebanese, Israelis, Russians, Canadians and others. Moreover, many jobs traditionally linked to the diamond trade, like cutting and polishing the stones, have emigrated in recent years, driven away by high taxes and salaries, to Tel Aviv or to low-wage countries, particularly India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the financial crisis and the jolt to the United States are shaking the diamond trade, especially in the holiday season, when a large part of the world's retail diamonds are bought and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Roughly half of all the polished diamonds traded in Antwerp are sold to consumers in the United States,'' said Philip Claes, spokesman for the World Diamond Center, a trade promotion group. ''And half again of those are sold between Christmas and New Year's, with a little extension trailing to St. Valentine's Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we see is exports down more than 10 percent,'' he added. ''It means trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diamond miners from Russia and South Africa reported that deliveries of rough diamonds to the market were off as much as 40 percent. Dealers talk of a ripple effect: when retail sales are off, sales of polished diamonds are off even more, and of uncut diamonds even more. Last month, the center laid off 24 employees, from a staff of 320.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Jews came to Antwerp's diamond trade in the late 19th century, when they fled pogroms in Eastern Europe. Many were on their way to the United States but settled here in Antwerp, hindered from crossing the Atlantic by illness or a lack of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years they have been shielded from the storms of the diamond market by the family structure of the business, in which companies are handed down father to son or shared among brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The total assets of a diamond company are its trading assets,'' said Freddy J. Hanard, 60, a former diamond banker who is now chief executive of the Diamond Center. ''You're not talking huge investments in equipment. So knowledge of who you are dealing with is important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jewish dealers can often be seen with a large briefcase, chained to their belt, containing much of their inventory. To this day, when a diamond changes hands, the seller, regardless of his ethnic background, says in Hebrew, mazel, meaning good luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the market employs about 7,000 people and creates work indirectly for another 26,000 as insurers, bankers, security guards and drivers. But the market has lost 25,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, since the 1970s, Mr. Claes said, with the exodus of cutters and polishers to markets like Mumbai, Tel Aviv and Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current gloom, however, Antwerp remains a vital Jewish community. ''There are only a few places today where you can see the way the Jews lived in the 17th and 18th century in Eastern Europe,'' said Julien Klener, 69, who is president of the Consistory, an umbrella organization of Jews in Belgium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, to wander today through the former Jewish districts in Polish cities like Krakow or Lodz is to encounter mainly ghosts. But the streets of Antwerp's main Jewish quarter, adjacent to the diamond market, are full of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moskowitz's butcher shop (''Since 1933'') is filled with customers, as is Kosher King across the street. In the evening, Hoffy's restaurant on Lange Kievitstraat is filled with diners, conversing animatedly in French and Dutch but mostly Yiddish, the language of the community. Antwerp remains one of the world's few centers of spoken Yiddish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ari Epstein, 33, is the son of a diamond trader, whose father emigrated from a village in Romania in the 1960s. ''It's a typical shtetl environment,'' he said, wearing the yarmulke with a business suit. ''It's live and let live. Most important is to do business together and to be honorable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, Meilech Bindinger, 30, a native of Newcastle, England, who married an Antwerp woman about 10 years ago, was asked by the rabbis of his Orthodox community to organize local social services, especially the Jewish Welfare and Health Care. He now has about 200 men and 150 women as volunteers whose main task is to visit the elderly and sick and help establish rooms in local hospitals where the Orthodox can feel comfortable with a place to pray or read and kosher meals to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the aged, he said, wearing a yarmulke under his black, broad-rimmed hat and toying with his earlocks, are ''Holocaust survivors in their twilight years, with unique requirements and sensibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vivid memories resurface. We are trying to find how to work in sensitive areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now with the mounting trouble on the diamond market, the organization faces other challenges. ''Every not-for-profit organization feels the credit crunch in a big way,'' he said, acknowledging that the organization ''is in the red.'' He added, ''It is tight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, like Mr. Epstein, said that even with charity, things will never be the same again in the Jewish diamond world. ''Buying and selling is not enough,'' he said. ''We need accountants, administrative directors, specialists for all you do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the son of a diamond trader, he grew up in the world of buying and selling. Yet he opted to study law, then went into management at the Diamond Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This comes as a shock to the diamond dealers,'' Mr. Epstein said. ''But the time of the grocery stores is over,'' he said. ''We live in a world of the supermarket.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking Cheerless</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomy outlook unveiled this week by the electronics giant <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> and a plunge in September retail sales show that consumers are in full retreat. December could be the first holiday season on record in which retail sales decline. That would threaten many retailers' ability to make full-year profits and further knock investor confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales figures are expressed in nominal dollars. That means that when inflation is present, reported sales can rise even if they decline in inflation-adjusted terms. Since the Census Bureau began keeping records in 1953, there has never been a December in which nominal retail sales fell below the previous year. That's because deep recessions have coincided with periods of high inflation. From 1979 to 1981, for example, retail sales rose in all three years in nominal terms, even though they dropped sharply in real or inflation-adjusted terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, though, nominal retail sales are dropping fast enough that year-over-year sales growth may drop below zero in December, despite rising prices. In September, for example, nominal sales were 1 percent below the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales decline is accelerating. <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>, whose competitor <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span> filed for bankruptcy protection this week, reported nominal comparable-store sales that were down 7.6 percent in October after a 2.4 percent fall in September. Even <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span>, which benefits from belt-tightening by consumers, reported an increase in comparable-store sales of only 2.4 percent in October, a 2.5 percent decline in real terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the Thanksgiving effect may keep December's nominal retail sales growth positive. The holiday is late this year, pushing some sales into December from November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decline in retail sales is arguably desirable to improve the savings rate and rebalance the economy. However, since many retailers' profitability for the year depends on holiday season sales, a Christmas with the first nominal retail sales decline in at least 55 years could be a serious short-term blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Expectations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure may look to be an asset class that has escaped the market turmoil. Investors poured $21.5 billion into infrastructure funds in the first nine months of the year, more than in 2006, according to Probitas Partners, a California research firm. Probitas estimates that in the next year, $94 billion of funds will be searching for investments. What's more, investors are expecting 12 to 15 percent annual returns, a higher goal than before the credit crisis hit. They could be disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds need higher returns than ever because the yield on other long-term investments has risen. A 10-year bond recently issued by <span class="companylink">Altria</span>, the tobacco company, came with a 10 percent yield. But it's hard to collect high enough returns on such projects as lenders become less willing to accept high leverage. The equity portion of investments has doubled to 40 percent since last year. Debt is more expensive, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, infrastructure assets like airports and highways aren't completely insulated from economic woes. They may have relatively stable cash flows. But traffic at BAA, the British airports group, was 5 percent lower in September than a year earlier. Road traffic has fallen in past recessions, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make the numbers work, infrastructure investors would have to pay much lower prices for infrastructure assets, perhaps some 30 percent below last year's levels for the funds to achieve a 12 percent return at the lower leverage levels that now apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of stocks and commodities have fallen more than that. State and local governments or companies might be forced to sell cheap. And while the expected flood of infrastructure buyers should bolster asset prices, some big players like Australia's Macquarie look less active lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the example of the Pennsylvania Turnpike isn't encouraging. Many analysts thought the $12.8 billion price was rich. But politicians vetoed the deal. Any suspicion of selling a trophy asset on the cheap is not good politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another way that these funds could hit their targets. Most are assuming they can refinance the debt on better terms in the next two or three years, increasing returns. That might happen. But in the short term, something has to give: the cost of debt, the price of assets, or investor returns. The last looks to be the most likely casualty.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Silicon Valley has always been a land of big, bold dreams. In the first Internet boom its start-ups either grew fast or died trying, sometimes spectacularly. The casualties of the bust, like Pets.com and Webvan, became legendary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this downturn, say investors and entrepreneurs, start-ups are adopting a strategy that they hope will let them hang on instead of flame out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To preserve cash, many tech start-ups are rushing to lay off employees and cut expenses. They are shelving their dreams of <span class="companylink">Google</span>-size riches and getting small, humble and thrifty, all with the more modest goal of surviving the coming economic winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, an unprofitable Internet start-up like Zivity, a social site that revolves around photos of models, might have turned into just another dot-bomb. Though it has paltry revenues and just 20,000 registered users, the company pays only $8,000 a month to rent its offices in San Francisco and has received $8 million from investors. This month it laid off 8 of its 22 employees -- saving enough money to stay alive through 2011 and survive even a prolonged recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we have a valuable product,'' said Cyan Banister, Zivity's co-founder. ''We should be able to weather the storm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in normal economic times, a majority of start-ups fail. But the same factors that have made it so easy to create Web 2.0-style start-ups -- low fixed costs, access to inexpensive overseas programmers and cheap ways to advertise online -- also make it relatively easy for even faltering companies to cut back their operations to the bare minimum and hang on through a slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web start-ups ''don't fail in the same way they used to fail,'' said Brad Burnham, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, adding that the previous generation of Internet companies lived hard and died young. Knowing when to pull the plug on the current crop of more frugal companies is now ''different, more subtle, more problematic,'' he said. ''They don't run into a wall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web companies in this new generation are so efficient with capital that venture capitalists ''may not have the plug in our hand,'' Mr. Burnham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only certainty in Silicon Valley is that survival is quickly becoming more challenging. The growth in online display advertising, which helps fuel the new Internet ecosystem, is declining. Venture capitalists and other investors in start-ups, like hedge funds, are cutting back. The market for initial public offerings remains closed and potential acquirers -- <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and the rest -- are deep in their own problems. Many entrepreneurs and deal makers agree that a shake-out is indeed coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists have begun preaching frugality, urging the start-ups they have invested in to cut costs and get profitable. Their advice shares themes: cut employees, do not count on raising more money and move quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurs appear to be listening. AdBrite, an online advertising network in San Francisco that raised $35 million in venture capital, recently laid off one-third of its staff, or 40 employees, to get to profitability next year. The company's chief executive, Iggy Fanlo, ran the e-commerce site Shopping.com during the first dot-com bust, and he said he recalled how wave after wave of layoffs sank morale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had gone through this before and we had death by a thousand cuts,'' Mr. Fanlo said. ''I wanted to credibly look people in the eye this time and say we are profitable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day seems to bring a new round of layoffs. In the last two weeks, the music site Imeem, the social search site Mahalo, the visual search engine Searchme, the real estate site Zillow, the Internet radio site Pandora and the social network Hi5 all cut as much as a quarter of their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many entrepreneurs, the lone goal has become survival. At Seesmic, a video blogging service, the day of reckoning -- when it runs out of the $6 million it raised in May -- will come in three years. To make the money last, Loic Le Meur, the chief executive, recently laid off seven employees, or one-third of his staff, and cut all projects not directly related to the video service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I can't make this work in three years it will be a failure,'' Mr. Le Meur said. ''If I can and I get through this, it will be much stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even companies with less than stellar track records and revenues say they can live through a protracted slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lala, a music site based in Palo Alto, Calif., has scrapped two music services and recently began a third site in conjunction with the major labels. The company raised $35 million three years ago and, thanks to financial prudence, has $20 million in the bank. It recently delayed plans to double its staff and it put its excess office space up for sublet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lala's founder, Bill Nguyen, expressed a measure of relief at the chill in the Valley. ''This whole economic crisis allows me not to have to grow,'' he said. ''I view this as a free hall pass.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wholesale resetting of expectations might be the biggest change to settle over Silicon Valley. Instead of aiming for blockbuster public offerings or market-shaking acquisitions, most entrepreneurs now just want to endure. But if not enough people use these start-ups' services and revenue does not grow fast enough to attract potential acquirers, mere survival may not look so good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Faraday Media, a Palo Alto start-up that is trying to create a personalized version of the Internet for its users, there is no revenue, no office space (the five employees work from their homes) and little chance of raising any capital from the newly miserly angel investors who would otherwise support a start-up of its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Saad, Faraday Media's founder, said the company saw no reason to give up. ''We are committed to the idea that the company and technology we are building is fundamentally going to reshape the Web,'' he said. ''We are committed to investing our time into this for as long as it takes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If these skeletal start-ups do succumb to the downturn, firms like Sherwood Partners, which specializes in bankruptcy consulting and shutting down companies, will be waiting. Sherwood Partners has not yet had the kind of activity it witnessed during the last bust, but Martin D. Pichinson, a partner at the company, is preparing for a burst of new business as many start-ups acknowledge that just because they can survive does not mean they should.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failing start-ups ''are already out there, and we are starting to close some of them, when investors say it needs to be done,'' Mr. Pichinson said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo. -- There are any number of ways to gauge an economic boom, and here lap dances may be a pretty good measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I make over $100,000 a year,'' bragged Eric Palmer, who works as a gas field operator in a town that has enriched many of them. Mr. Palmer was surrounded by a bevy of strippers at the Astro Lounge, all of them eager to take advantage of his generosity. ''I spend $3,000 a weekend here,'' he said. ''I just love the company of beautiful women.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The women in Rock Springs, off Interstate 80 in southern Wyoming, seem to like Mr. Palmer and his ilk, which is why they travel from cities across America -- often places where the economy has tanked -- to make thousands of dollars a week at places like the Astro Lounge. Most of their customers are men who work in natural gas exploration and production and who have few other ways or places to spend money on their rare days off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gas industry has almost single-handedly set Wyoming in stark contrast to the rest of the nation, where industries have fallen on hard times, homes are in foreclosures and many Americans have lost their jobs. While other states are laying off workers and cutting programs, Wyoming has enjoyed billions of dollars in surpluses in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a sort of relaxed composure here that other towns in America are not enjoying as the race for president enters its final chapter. Many voters here seem to agree: whoever wins is not likely to stand in the way of Wyoming and its natural gas fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the opposite economy of the rest of the United States,'' said Steve Aaron, who was eating dinner at the Coyote Creek steak house across the street from the Astro Lounge. Mr. Aaron works in the court system and is a part-time minister. ''But we still wonder and worry about what's going on around the rest of the country,'' he said, ''even though people in the oil fields are making more money than they ever have in their lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fortunes here stem from the state's enormous supply of natural gas -- its reserves are second only to Texas -- and its role in supplying not only a demanding domestic market but other nations as well. Wyoming, the home state of Vice President Dick Cheney, has benefited from the Bush administration's energy policies, which opened up land for natural gas drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men making $15 an hour five years ago now take in as much as $26, and it all makes for very deep pockets for the workforce, much of it drawn from out of state. There is not very much to do in this town but work, and that is enough for most people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was drawn here for economic reasons,'' said Colt Felmlee, 24, who was interviewed at the steak house. Mr. Felmlee, a foreman for an oil fields service company, moved here from Montana, where the wages are not as high. ''I don't find it hard to relate to the rest of the country's problems because I've been there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Felmlee said he believed Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, was the candidate who most supported his industry. ''I think with him in office I would continue to do well,'' he said. ''I think in general the oil industry supports McCain. Not many people would take a strong opposition to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other oil workers said they supported Mr. McCain as well, but others said they were for Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think he'll be a stronger leader,'' said Cory Rock, as he sucked on a cigar at the strip club. But while the state's governor, Dave Freudenthal, is a Democrat, this mostly Republican state is almost certainly in Mr. McCain's column.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the industries that serve oil workers -- steak houses, title brokers and bars -- have done well in the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I find it odd that we are so for finding alternative sources of energy when this is where the money is,'' said Meesa, a stripper in the club who came from Idaho and asked to be identified by only her stage name. She makes about $500 a night. ''The guys here are paid hand over fist for extremely hard labor,'' she said, ''and there is no where to spend it here but on us.''</p>

The Ifo Institute's closely watched indicator of German business confidence fell for a fourth month, to hit its lowest level since May 2005, when economic woes forced former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to call early elections. Other surveys showed Italian corporate sentiment mired at record lows last seen after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. French business morale plunged to its worst level in more than five years. Germany, France and Italy have the biggest economies in the 15-nation euro zone, together making up about two-thirds of its total gross domestic product.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the new Wall Street -- it's the center of gravity,'' said Fares Noujaim, <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>'s new president of the company's business in the Middle East and North Africa, pointing up at the main building of the Dubai International Financial Center that covers the sky above him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called the Gate, it seems more a giant slab of modern art than an office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dubai boom has been riding oil's ascent for years now. Its ultramodern skyline, which barely existed little more than a decade ago, has become a prominent symbol of the emergence of this once scrubby emirate on the western coast of the Persian Gulf as the Middle East's principal financial, trade and tourism center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the deepening bite of the credit crisis spreads from Wall Street and takes a global toll -- torpedoing once-buoyant markets from Shanghai to Stockholm -- the Gate has recently become an even more powerful beacon for a swarm of deal makers looking to stake their claim in one of the world's last remaining bull markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are staggering. Dubai's economic growth is running at roughly 11 percent a year and the government expects it to continue at that pace. Housing prices spiked 42 percent in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though it has little oil of its own, Dubai's welcoming social and investment climate, along with special zones with independent laws, has turned it into a trading entrepot on steroids, beyond Beirut in the 1970s and Hong Kong in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn of an unmanaged boom, as high inflation, a weakening currency and rampant construction stoke fears of a severe reversal to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Mr. Noujaim, such concerns are for another day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bubble? What bubble?'' Mr. Noujaim asked, pressing his case that the global demand for oil, despite the recent dip in prices, would push its value even higher. ''This will be the next Singapore or Hong Kong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Noujaim is living in a nearby hotel as he struggles to find lodging in Dubai's supercharged real estate market. His new office is just becoming operational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no matter: his BlackBerry is humming and at a time when the spirits of investment bankers worldwide are at their lowest ebb, he has euphoria to spare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a timeless similarity among investment bankers swept up in a bull market. The sentences come quicker, the workday pushes longer and the eye's gaze becomes all the more intense -- quite simply, the rest of the world's troubles seem far, far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai and the oil-fired economies in the region that it services have become just such a vantage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like the best of gold fevers, this buildup is fraught with a competitive edge that reaches straight to the chief executive's suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this decade, multiple trips to China became the de rigueur assignment among Wall Street chief executives panning for rich overseas deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it is the Middle East: John J. Mack of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and Lloyd C. Blankfein of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> have been here several times since the latest boom erupted a few years ago. Richard S. Fuld Jr. of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> has come once and John A. Thain, who took over at Merrill last year, is scheduled to arrive this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> highlights its 42 Dubai-based investment bankers and a flourishing office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has recently moved its co-head of investment banking, Alberto Verme, to the region; <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">UBS</span> are sending bankers over in bundles; and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> has sent a top fixed-income ally of Mr. Blankfein's to plant the firm's flag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And just this week Barclay's wealth management unit, Global Investors, established an office in the financial center here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom may be on, but it is by no means clear that the volume of deals and the opportunities in shallow and heavily regulated capital markets will be enough to sustain these aggressive expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for the corporate executives in the region, hit with a barrage of introductory phone calls, requests for meetings and proffered business cards, the question is this: Will Merrill, Morgan and Goldman be here when the inevitable correction comes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To listen to Georges Makhoul, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s Middle East business, the answer is a resounding yes. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> arrived here in 2005 and became one of the first American banks to establish a presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a full-service commitment,'' said Mr. Makhoul, as he led a visitor through the firm's bustling head office. ''You want to do it right,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chock-full of research analysts, investment bankers and traders, it is by far the largest presence among United States investment banks -- and a cause of skepticism, or perhaps envy, from its competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prove his point, Mr. Makhoul prints outs a sheet of paper, showing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> as the top underwriter in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have over 150 people in the region,'' he said. ''That is an example of making the right bets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneath Mr. Makhoul's office, a warren of fancy store outlets promise no shortage of treats for flush investment bankers. In one, a well-coiffed banker eyes a Porsche wristwatch and does not bat an eye when a salesman quotes a price of $11,000. Next door, more bankers line up to be fitted for their English bespoke suits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just a march of bankers -- Dubai lures as many as 20,000 new people a month, a number that includes large numbers of workers from the South Asian subcontinent who make the bankers' beds in hotels and drive them around in the cool comfort of their Mercedes (about 90 percent of Dubai's population of 1.4 million is foreign).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We, too, come here for the money,'' said Mosrallah Khan, who works a 12-hour day as a taxi driver to earn enough to send home to his family in Peshawar, Pakistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When night falls, the deal making continues even as the action shifts from the board room to the many bars and nightclubs located in the city's hotels. Islam is the emirate's religion; accordingly the sale of liquor is largely limited to hotels -- but that is about as far as restrictions go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Buddha Bar in the newly opened Grosvenor House, Arabs, resplendent in their flowing white robes, knock back glasses of whiskey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Sochos, a sushi bar that overlooks the Arabian Sea, the partying takes on a more relentless aspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''God, this place is so much fun,'' said a young banker from a major Wall Street house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had one arm draped around a willowy Russian blonde wearing a short skirt and leather boots; in his other hand he juggled a drink and a BlackBerry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was close to 1 a.m. Work beckoned a few hours later and he seemed reluctant to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the senior bankers sent to Dubai, the work schedule is so relentless that there is little time for such cavorting. Not only are they under pressure to produce fees for their revenue-starved firms, but the fact that Saudi Arabia starts its week on Saturday with the rest of the region following on Sunday means there are in effect no weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a charge they embrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For me, being here is very personal,'' said Wassim Younan, who came here in 2005 after running <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>'s powerful bond and commodities trading unit in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldman is the second-ranked adviser in the region and Mr. Younan makes learning the local etiquette a part of the orientation program for new arrivals to Goldman's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all have big balance sheets,'' he said, ''but it really comes down to the quality of your people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan is Christian Lebanese, like his peers at Merrill, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> -- where Makram Azar was recently appointed head of sovereign funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all being in their mid-40s, there is little fraternization among this highly competitive group. They all agree, though, that their familiarity with the region and its language confers an advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives you an edge,'' said Mr. Azar, a top media banker at Lehman who moved to Dubai this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if oil prices stay well above $100 a barrel, there may indeed be enough business for all. The current price of energy means that nearly $2 billion is moving every day from the pockets of consumers around the world to the oil producers in this region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look at all this growth,'' said Mr. Noujaim, as he sat immobile in a traffic jam in Riyadh last month, surrounded by skyscrapers, some recently completed, others still under construction. ''This could be America 100 years ago.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank stocks spun wildly on Tuesday in another bruising day for financial companies. Goaded by bearish analysts, investors seem to be abandoning American banks in droves.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a fraction of the nation's banks are expected to buckle under their growing burden of bad loans, federal regulators, bank executives and analysts agree that the vast majority of institutions are sound. Bank customers are not panicking, particularly since most of their deposits are insured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But shareholders, whose investments are by no means guaranteed, are running scared. It is becoming increasingly clear that even the strongest banks will be grappling with bad loans for years -- and that the outlook for the industry could worsen further if the economy and the housing market continue to weaken. The collapse of <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp</span> last week fanned long-smoldering worries that even healthy banks confront significant challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketplace is passing harsh judgment on an industry that was a darling of Wall Street when home prices and mortgage lending boomed in recent years. The mood darkened further on Tuesday, when the <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corporation</span> was compelled to assert that it was sound as its share price was swept lower for a fifth day. <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> fell nearly 8 percent, leaving it down 76 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-stock <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500 Regional Banks index sank nearly 4 percent, extending its 11 percent decline from Monday. Financial companies like the <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a stark reversal of fortune for the banking industry, and for regional lenders in particular. Many regional banks, big enough to have some heft, but small enough to be managed effectively, rode the mortgage boom to higher profits. Many avoided the alphabet soup of complex debt investments that have cost big banks tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a year ago, many of these banks looked like attractive takeover targets, and investors placed hefty premiums to their share prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now all of that has changed, and the missteps the banks made in good times are glaring. Investors are recoiling from banks that overreached with what turned out to be ill-fated acquisitions. Lenders that need to raise capital are also being shunned, as are those that have made many loans to builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole allure of regional banks has gone out of fashion,'' said David Hendler, a research analyst at Credit Sights in New York. ''They used to have the best perfume in the business. Now, they have an odor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National City Corporation</span> of Cleveland, for example, expanded into Florida just before the bottom fell out of the housing market there. The bank recently raised $7 billion to shore up its finances, and said on Monday that its Tier 1 capital ratio, an important measure of a bank's financial health, ranked among the highest in its class.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such assurances, National City has lost nearly 90 percent of its value in the last year. It sank 4.5 percent on Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks that once seemed like attractive takeover targets now look like pariahs. <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks</span> of Atlanta, which was soaring a year ago on hopes that it might be acquired at a lofty price, has plummeted nearly 70 percent this year, as the prospect of a sale has been mired in losses.

But when it raised only about $47 million in its first attempt, investors concluded the bank was struggling to raise cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The stock has literally cratered,'' said Richard X. Bove, a prominent banking analyst. ''It has just fallen apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some bright spots on Tuesday. Shares of the <span class="companylink">First Horizon National Corporation</span>, the largest bank in Tennessee, jumped nearly 17 percent after the bank's chief executive offered assurances that the bank has enough capital.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just bringing capital to China is not sufficient, with China itself having more than $1 trillion in reserves,'' Daniel A. Carroll, managing partner of TPG's operations in Asia, said at the Boao Forum for Asia, a nonprofit event modeled after the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ''It's about offering expertise, which is about management.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to get a share of the fast-growing Chinese economy, private equity firms are adapting to meet demands by Chinese companies that go beyond financing. They include management skills, help in solving regulatory problems in cross-border takeovers and access to a network that allows them to expand abroad. As a result, buyout firms, which usually aim for a controlling stake in a company, are seeking smaller stakes and investments in state-owned companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carroll's comments were echoed by managers at the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, who shared a panel. The conference was held for the first time in London as the city competes for clout in the Chinese market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''China is going to be a very, very important market for us long term,'' said Johannes P. Huth, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis.</span> ''The macroeconomic environment is very favorable, and the entrepreneurial culture attracts us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global private equity firms have poured into China looking for ways to benefit from rapid economic growth, especially as growth in developed economies is slowing. Yet, competition for talent and investments is fierce and investment plans are limited by tight regulations that restrict the stakes of foreign firms in certain industries, including natural resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerry Murphy, senior managing director at <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> in London, said investments in China generally involved more equity and less borrowed money, and were smaller than in developed markets. But private equity firms will want to exert the same influence over management decisions as elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew E. Wolff, a partner and managing director at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, said investments could range from backing private entrepreneurs to helping state-owned companies to reorganize ahead of an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private equity investors also could advise companies on possible takeover targets abroad. Natural resources and renewable energy are two particularly hot areas the company is eager to invest in, Mr. Wolff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carroll agreed but added that a 25 percent limit on foreign ownership in natural resources firms meant that TPG had focused more on investments in companies one step removed from the sector, like mining services firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of the intensity of the competition among private equity firms for investments in these industries came when a Chinese businessman in the audience asked how his company could attract such funds. Almost all the private equity managers said they wanted to discuss a possible investment in his company.</p>

''The target industry must be stagnant and populated with companies that cling to doing business the way they always have.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANAGEMENT MODELS Is there a formal model that companies can follow to grow internally? Robert C. Wolcott and Michael J. Lippitz, both associated with Northwestern University's business school, list in an article in the M.I.T.Sloan Management Review the following four models:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunist. The company provides no formal process to follow. Various departments and individuals work on their own ideas and then seek corporate financing. This is what happens at Zimmer Holdings, a medical device company with more than $3 billion in sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enabler. The company provides clear criteria for the sorts of things it would like developed, application guidelines for financing and support from senior management, then leaves it to employees to come up with new ideas. This, the authors say, is the model Google employs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer. ''A few companies such as I.B.M., Motorola and Cargill pursue corporate entrepreneurship by establishing and supporting formal organizations with significant dedicated funds or active influence over business unit funding.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocate. A company ''strongly evangelizes'' for corporate entrepreneurship but, as is the case at DuPont, leaves it up to the individual business units to provide financing and manage the process.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHANGED FOR GOOD Radical transformation efforts inside big companies fail for any number of reasons, among them insufficient resources devoted to the task, a loss of interest by the chief executive or naysayers who are allowed to stay in place.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two McKinsey consultants argue that focusing on two areas can improve the chances that a company will change for the better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive should set ''an appropriate and inspiring aspiration'' and then help mobilize ''the flow of energy and ideas needed to drive the organization forward,'' argue Josep Isern and Caroline Pung, writing in The McKinsey Quarterly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders must define the objective at the outset, delineating clear initiatives and painting a vivid picture of what success will look like, they contend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A good transformation story bridges the gap between top management and the rest of the organization,'' they write. ''Typically, using metaphor and analogies to explain what is at stake, it addresses three key aspects: the case for change, the challenges and opportunities ahead and the impact of change on the individuals.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of corporate chief executives and chief financial officers released yesterday showed sharp declines in optimism about the economy and business conditions, providing more evidence that the economy is slowing.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 9 percent of chief financial officers said they were more optimistic about the economy in December than they had been three months earlier, a record low. ''We've never seen anything like that,'' said John R. Graham, a finance professor at Duke University, which conducted the survey with CFO Magazine. ''C.F.O. optimism is spiraling downward.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly survey of chief executives found that 41 percent expected employment in the economy would decrease over the next three months, by far the largest such figure since the survey began in late 2002. Only 16 percent forecast an improvement in employment, with the rest expecting no change. As recently as July, only 12 percent forecast the employment situation would worsen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''C.E.O.'s have been clear over the past several months that they are worried about the economic climate,'' said Edward M. Kopko, the publisher of Chief Executive magazine, which conducted the survey of 533 chief executives who subscribe to the magazine. ''The recent dramatic drop in confidence may suggest that the worst is yet to come.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the C.E.O. confidence index fell for the fourth consecutive month, and was the lowest since May 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp trend toward pessimism appears to have affected smaller companies more than larger ones, and to have the strongest impact at companies with the least-solid balance sheets. Mr. Graham said that a third of the 573 American C.F.O.'s said their companies had been hurt by the credit crisis, but that half of those with credit ratings of BBB, the lowest investment grade rating, or lower, said their companies had been hurt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surveys were released a day after a more upbeat survey of 105 chief executives who are members of the Business Roundtable, a group of large American companies. That survey showed a small increase in confidence from the previous quarter, with 33 percent saying they expected their companies to increase hiring in this country in the next six months, while 22 percent expected to cut employment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pessimism seems to be less pronounced for executives' own companies. Among the financial officers, 34.3 percent said they were more optimistic about their own companies than they had been three months earlier. But that was the lowest positive response to that question since it was first asked in 2002, and 36.6 percent said they had become more pessimistic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among chief executives, slightly more said their companies were reducing capital spending than said they planned increases. But the C.F.O. survey showed an average increase of 4.1 percent planned for capital spending, higher than the 3.2 percent planned three months earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial officer survey asked, for the first time, if companies had experienced ''an increase in the number of employees taking loans or making hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) accounts?'' A total of 18.5 percent said they had, with the most-cited reason being the need to make mortgage payments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit crisis, which began in the subprime mortgage market, has spread to the leveraged loan market, which is a source of financing for many companies that lack investment-grade credit ratings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Fed has considerable interest in measuring the potential impact of the credit crisis on the overall economy,'' said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke professor who founded the C.F.O. survey, ''and our survey provides the first direct evidence of the credit fallout.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that of the firms that said they had been affected by the credit problems, ''one-third will cut capital spending plans as a result of the conditions, and one-quarter indicate that hiring plans will be scaled back. These actions are detrimental to economic growth.''   </p>

Another report, this one from the government, estimated that Germany's annual inflation rose to 3 percent this month, its highest level in more than 13 years, as a result of high prices for oil products, food and beverages. The Ifo Institute for Economic Research said its business climate index rose slightly, to 104.2, from 103.9 in October, after slipping for six straight months. Companies assessed their current situation more positively than in October, but were ''somewhat more cautious'' regarding the six-month business outlook, said Hans-Werner Sinn, above, Ifo's president. The 3 percent annual inflation estimate by the Federal Statistics Office was up from 2.4 percent in October.</p>

Precisely to whom this will occur has yet to be decided. Word along the waterfront identifies several good candidates. Larry Ellison, the billionaire software magnate behind the American entry, BMW Oracle, is a popular choice. Another is Patrizio Bertelli, the head of the Italian effort and the C.E.O. of the design house Prada, his boats's main sponsor. Then there is Ernesto Bertarelli, an elegant 41-year-old billionaire from Geneva who is the current holder of the Cup, which his team, Alinghi, wrested away from New Zealand in 2003.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One man happily exempt from this specter of sudden heartsick, however, is Xavier de Lesquen, a former French naval officer who, as the executive manager of China Team, oversees that nation's fledgling effort to win the oldest trophy in sports. Cup dreams tend to sour swiftly, with stunning, tearful finality, and it is considered bad juju to prognosticate. Even so, several outcomes are already certain. By the time you read this, China Team will have taken its lumps and been eliminated from the competition, transforming de Lesquen's role from that of participant to interested observer. China's departure will have surprised no one, not even de Lesquen. The campaign started tardily and was woefully underfunded; for every dollar that a superteam like Alinghi or BMW Oracle had to spend, China had only a dime. Lacking the wherewithal to build a team from scratch, the Chinese absorbed a French team, taking possession of most of its assets. These included an America's Cup-class racing yacht, a support staff, several French crew members and de Lesquen. Because China is home to few world-class yachtsmen -- and those who might be said to qualify were focused on the Beijing Olympics -- it took some effort to assemble the 17-man crew required to sail an America's Cup yacht. Officials of the Chinese Yachting Association fanned out across the country and plucked unsuspecting sailors from provincial teams. After congratulating the young men for having achieved their theretofore unknown dream of competing in an America's Cup, the officials hustled them off to Valencia, where they bivouacked in communal flats and communicated with their teammates, who are primarily French, via translators. ''I think our Chinese friends are a little bit homesick, yes,'' de Lesquen admitted when I visited Spain in April. ''It's a very strange thing for them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Lesquen is fair-skinned for a sailor, with a nest of peach-colored hair and the bemused look of a man uncoupled from all expectations. This is his third go-round in the America's Cup, and he exudes a charming (and useful) Continental unflappability. During its first months in competition, China Team was comically inept: snapping spars, ripping sails and bungling the most basic racing strategy. Once, while enjoying a rare lead, the boat's bowman tumbled over the side and vanished, prompting the race announcer to cry, ''There he goes!'' Of late, though, de Lesquen's men had begun to find an awkward rhythm. ''Every day we gain a lot,'' he said. ''They are learning.'' Though he wasn't expecting any victories in the upcoming Louis Vuitton Cup, the round-robin tourney that would decide who challenges Alinghi for the Cup, de Lesquen could report to his Chinese backers that their campaign was proceeding well, all things considered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Lesquen led me on a brief tour of China Team's base, which sits at the southwest edge of Port America's Cup, the venue built by the city of Valencia for the event. Each team maintains a base, in which they work, eat, train and entertain. China's is the most humble: a latticework of iron scaffolding shrouded in plastic sheeting. Within this greenhouse are a series of stacked metal shipping containers, of the type used on ocean freighters and by international smugglers, although in this instance they serve as the team's lockers, offices and kitchen. Atop the base is an outdoor terrace with a dragon-themed bar -- an homage to the team yacht, which they call Longtze, or ''son of dragon.'' The name, the team literature says, evokes ''speed and elegance at the same time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the kindest thing that can be said of China Team's facility is that it commands a fine view of the other bases. After we had climbed to the roof, I joined de Lesquen in gazing out over the harbor. Directly across the water stood Alinghi's base. Had it not pre-dated China Team's base, the Alinghi facility would seem to exist simply to mock it. Approximately the size of a small urban mall, it contains a basketball court, cinema, bandstand, gymnasium, gift shop and multilevel hospitality area known as Club Alinghi, which is furnished in a Euro style familiar to anyone who has ever received a catalog from Design Within Reach. The base cost almost as much as China Team's entire budget.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hopes of winning the 32nd America's Cup, which begins on June 23, Ernesto Bertarelli and his Alinghi syndicate will spend an estimated $135 million. Larry Ellison and BMW Oracle will spend $175 million, much of which comes from Ellison personally. Patrizio Bertelli's Prada team, known as Luna Rossa Challenge, will spend $135 million, and Emirates Team New Zealand will spend a relatively modest $100 million. By July 7, one of these four teams will hoist the America's Cup, having expended a combined $545 million -- almost $100 million more than it costs NASA to mount a space shuttle mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Lesquen turned from the view. An afternoon breeze had arrived, lofting a flock of cocktail napkins toward the sea. China Team's base was not yet complete; the thin plastic walls kept peeling free, and base security remained a strand of rope clipped to a plywood desk. But de Lesquen appeared untroubled. He stood smiling on the roof in the sun. ''At the end of the day,'' de Lesquen announced, ''this is a nice place to be.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The America's Cup has always been about money, even before it was the America's Cup. Origins of the contest trace to a taunt, made in 1850 by a now forgotten English merchant, which asserted that British boats were better than American boats. The merchant, so the story goes, dared anyone to prove otherwise. When this challenge reached the ear of John Cox Stevens, a millionaire and the first commodore of the New York Yacht Club, he assembled a syndicate of peers and hired a 31-year-old boat builder named George Steers to build the swiftest yacht possible. Seeking to stoke Steers's competitive fire -- or perhaps simply out of sheer deviousness -- Stevens's syndicate shifted its economic risk onto the naval architect. Payment for the $30,000 yacht, the contract stated, was conditional upon the boat's being ''faster than every vessel brought against her,'' in the United States or in England.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undaunted, Steers fashioned a yacht unlike any seen before. At the time, design theory held that a ship should have ''a cod's head and a mackerel's tail,'' meaning that the bow should be round and blunt and the stern narrow to a point. Steers reversed these conventions. His ship -- which would be christened America -- showed first as the blade of a sword, thickened gracefully at its midpoint, then fattened to a well-balanced finish. Also, British yachts of the era were typically rigged with a multitude of small, squarish sails made from flax, a troublesome material that required continual dousing with seawater to tighten the weave. America, in contrast, sported massive, asymmetrical sails constructed of machine-woven cotton duck, which more easily caught and held the wind, supplying the boat with astounding power. When Steers's masterpiece glided into English waters, the reaction of the British fleet was, as The Times of London reported, like one that ''the appearance of a sparrowhawk in the horizon creates among a flock of woodpigeons.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On August 22, 1851, America entered the Royal Yacht Squadron's annual regatta, challenging 14 boats on a 53-mile race to circumnavigate the Isle of Wight. It was hardly a contest. Though America became entangled in its anchor chain at the start, within 90 minutes it had outdistanced the field -- at one point building a seven-and-a-half-mile lead. America crossed the finish line alone, untested, as a band played ''Yankee Doodle Dandy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost before the music faded, however, the unsentimental syndicate sold America to a British Army captain, earning a $1,750 profit. The trophy that Steers had won for them -- a homely silver ewer that would become known as the America's Cup -- was carried to New York and unveiled at a celebration in Astor House, where it was displayed among roast quail and dessert crafted in the shape of the America. No one bothered to invite George Steers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years to follow, the trophy remained mostly forgotten. The syndicate's members discussed melting it down and recasting it as medals they might wear while lounging in their club, but the scheme never developed. Eventually, the surviving members gave the trophy to the New York Yacht Club, yoked to a deceptively clever document known as the Deed of Gift, which stated that ''this Cup is donated upon the conditions that it shall be preserved as a perpetual Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign countries.'' A variety of other reasonable-sounding requirements were set forth, none of which seemed especially onerous until it dawned on the careful reader that the Deed's net effect was to rig the game in favor of whoever holds the Cup -- a wily bit of odds stacking that enabled the N.Y.Y.C. to retain the trophy for 132 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason this sport is so unfair -- and there's nothing fair about it -- is because it's a winner-take-all game,'' explained Bill Koch, a self-described nerd from Kansas who spent $68 million to win the Cup in 1992 aboard America3. ''The winner gets the Cup, gets to set the venue, gets to pick the racecourse, gets to select the umpires and gets to select the judges.'' The rules have been made slightly more fair since Koch's campaign, but he does have a point. If the Deed of Gift was bound to the Lombardi Trophy, for instance, then the Indianapolis Colts could demand that the next Super Bowl be played in 2011, at Yankee Stadium, using flag-football rules, and be officiated by members of the Manning family.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An M.I.T. grad, Koch once did the math and determined that any one challenger has only a 5 percent chance of stealing the Cup from the defender. (''It's just crazy!'' Koch shouted.) Yet despite these odds, a certain class of people will seemingly spend anything, and endure anything, in the attempt. Ted Turner, who won the Cup in 1977 aboard Courageous, described the experience as ''the closest I shall ever get to heaven.'' Sir Frank Packer, another media titan who sought the Cup -- twice, without success -- blamed his costly quest on ''alcohol and delusions of grandeur.'' Baron Marcel Bich, the inventor of the Bic pen, spent an estimated $4 million of his fortune, only to end up as the lone competitor ever to become lost during a race. (After being towed to safety, Bich punched a cameraman documenting his rescue.) The baron made three more runs at the Cup, losing ingloriously every time, but he reportedly considered his investment well spent, as it offered a nifty branding opportunity for his line of disposable pens and razors. (Such marketing tactics do have their limits. Yves Rousset-Rouard, who headed a French campaign in 1983, likely saw little benefit to his signature product, a series of soft-core motion pictures featuring an adventuresome young woman named Emmanuelle.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the rationale for competing in the Cup remains personal and even egotistical -- which, fortunately, tends to ensure the presence of oddballs in the mix. One favorite among Cup cognoscenti is William Henn, whose Galatea sailed in 1886 with a crew that included a raccoon, dogs, cats and a monkey named Peggy, who assisted in the lowering of sails and also served as team cheerleader, racing to the bowsprit and screeching and jumping with delight whenever Galatea took the lead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one thing is missing from this America's Cup, it's the enlivening presence of a truly eccentric character like Turner or Bich or Henn. The person who comes closest is Ellison, a complex man with an intriguing irascibility. (During the lead-up to the 2003 Cup, his skipper actually booted him off the yacht.) But he's too seldom seen around Port America's Cup to truly engage the masses. A week after I departed Valencia, Ellison finally joined his team for its stretch run. Precious few locals ever got a good look at him, though. ''Larry's feet never touch the ground,'' a BMW Oracle team member explained. ''He goes right from the chase boat to the yacht and then back onto his own yacht.'' (His own yacht being the $200 million Rising Sun, which at 453 feet is too long to dock in Port America's Cup.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As reigning champion, Ernesto Bertarelli is more visible. To date, however, he has failed to exhibit any memorable quirkiness, beyond, perhaps, being married to a former Miss United Kingdom. Bertarelli is slender and fine-featured, with perfect skin and a tan deep enough to touch bone. In 1996, he took over Serono, his family's pharmaceutical firm, which had grown rich by developing the fertility drug that enabled the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby. Bertarelli steered the company into the American market, doubled its sales and then, earlier this year, sold the company to Merck for more than $13 billion. He is personable and polite. But he has never caught fire in the public imagination the way some of his flamboyant predecessors did. People magazine covered Bill Koch's rollicking chase for the Cup. Bertarelli's 2003 campaign was the subject of a case study by Babson College's William F. Glavin Center for Global Management.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You gotta be willing to spend your last penny,'' Koch told me, explaining how to make a splash. ''And you gotta be willing to put every conceivable effort in it and be willing to sacrifice everything to win. It led to my divorce, and it led to my 6-year-old son hating sailing. And it's basically a silly sailboat race, and its only importance is in the minds of the participants.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many sports subcultures -- curling comes to mind, as does biathlon -- professional yachting can seem inscrutable and slightly ridiculous to outsiders. It's a sport lacking a fan base, failing even to command the attention of the approximately one million amateur sailors in the United States. Few people wake in the morning with the thought, I need to see some sailing. When the Outdoor Life Network (now Versus) aired portions of the 2003 America's Cup preliminaries, the broadcast garnered a dismal rating of 0.1: fewer than 60,000 people. (Although, to be sure, that tiny audience is very wealthy and a desirable demographic to team sponsors and to advertisers.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before he won in 2003, Bertarelli was contemplating ways to increase the Cup's popularity. One bothersome aspect of the sport was that it vanished from the public eye for years at a time before magically reappearing, like a cloud of cicadas. Working with Larry Ellison, Bertarelli began to systematically modernize the sport, in part by remaking it in the image of other, more visible professional sports. He added 13 regattas, known as ''acts,'' to serve as a sort of four-year-long regular season. (And also to keep the yachts, which function as floating billboards, in front of the cameras.) These 13 acts lead to a playoff, called the Louis Vuitton Cup, from which a challenger emerges to duel the champion in the America's Cup. (The Louis Vuitton Cup is taking place now, and will end no later than June 12.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the N.B.A. and the N.F.L. administer all aspects of their respective sports, Bertarelli created A.C.M., America's Cup Management, to coordinate promotion of the America's Cup, strike television deals, arrange revenue sharing and oversee the venue, which, for the first time, was put out to bid. (Valencia beat out Naples and Marseille, among others, by promising to spend 500 million euros on the event.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is said that Bertarelli won his Cup -- and with it the ability to reconfigure the sport -- mainly by hiring the best match racer in the world to be his skipper. This was Russell Coutts, a lantern-jawed New Zealander who had won the trophy in 1995 (skunking Dennis Conner in the best-of-nine event) and again in 2000. Following Coutts's second victory, Bertarelli reached out to him, saying he was interested in buying one of New Zealand's yachts. The two hit it off and soon after met in a New York City hotel room, where Bertarelli offered Coutts a job. By checkout time, Coutts had agreed to skipper Alinghi, for a salary reported to be $5 million a year. New Zealanders responded to Coutts's career move by branding him a traitor, plastering anti-Coutts billboards in Auckland and issuing death threats. Coutts answered with a five-nil thrashing of his former team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the two men have since had an ugly falling out -- reportedly over control of A.C.M. -- the poaching of Coutts rearranged the economics of the sport. ''All of a sudden it became the big leagues,'' explained Peter Isler, BMW Oracle's navigator and a veteran of four campaigns. ''And not just for the Russell Coutts and Dennis Conners and those types of folks, but for the grinders, who were all of a sudden in six figures.'' America's Cup sailors now command as much as $1 million a year, a pay scale that allows wealthy campaigns to corner the market on elite talent, while handicapping poor campaigns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, such concentration of free-agent skill makes for better racing (at least in matches between wealthy teams). But it also dilutes a campaign's identity. Should they face each other in the America's Cup, BMW Oracle, the American boat, will likely have only three Americans aboard, including Ellison, and Alinghi, representing Switzerland, will probably have only one Swiss sailor -- Bertarelli. Meanwhile, more than half of the remaining crewmen on the two boats will hail from New Zealand. ''For most teams here the national image is less than the sponsor images,'' said Isler, an American. ''But I would say to all those who cry, 'Crass commercialism, nationalism is gone,' you'll be the first one on the parade when the Cup comes home.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The type of Cup fever that manifests as a parade, however, is rare. Most people simply understand too little about the sport to become infected. The teams, well aware of this dilemma, put a premium on newbie education. In Valencia, BMW Oracle maintains a sort of classroom at its base, where visitors receive instruction in boat building, match racing and the various responsibilities of the crew. (Quick lesson: imagine the team as characters in a Pixar film, with the nimble bowmen scampering the foredeck and shinnying the mast; mammoth grinders cranking the winches; and alert and clever members of the afterguard, the boat's brain trust, driving the yacht and orchestrating it all.) The atmosphere is intended to be one part Epcot and one part ESPN Zone, although the kid-pleasing experience suffers when it's time to learn more about Larry Ellison. ''As client/server computing becomes increasingly popular,'' we are told, ''Oracle rolls out Oracle Version 5 . . . one of the first RDBMSs to operate in the server mode.'' At this point the class usually abandons Larry and makes for the Alinghi base, where the educational offerings include an America's Cup arcade game and a full-scale simulator yacht that bucks and pitches and yaws.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for most spectators, Alinghi's simulator is as near as they'll get to the action. Last month, in a charity auction, a Chicago businessman paid $102,600 for the right to ride aboard the BMW Oracle yacht during an America's Cup race (if the team makes it that far). As this suggests, proximity to the sport's central drama is usually determined by the thickness of a person's wallet. For $750, fans can purchase seats on one of the spectator boats operated by A.C.M., which bounce along in the distant wake of the competitors. A private yacht ensures a better spot in the spectator flotilla, and one can be chartered for the duration or, of course, purchased outright -- although berthing fees at the Port America's Cup ''superyacht'' marina can approach a million dollars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest route to a decent vantage point is to own or be employed by a sponsoring corporation, which can land you on a team's hospitality boat. One afternoon, I finagled my way aboard Alcor, the 115-foot yacht that BMW Oracle uses for entertaining, and spent an impossibly pleasant day on the water, eating tournedos of Argentine beef and drinking champagne, while the captain kept us within spitting distance of the racers. Such plums are portioned out to high-powered executives or to whatever celebrity ambles through Valencia -- Demi Moore was a recent recipient. On other teams they serve as management perks, used by a sponsor to reward star performers. After scoring an invitation to the Alinghi hospitality boat, I found myself surrounded by several dozen mid-level managers from UBS, the Swiss financial-services firm that sponsors Alinghi.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prepare the bankers for their role as America's Cup fans, Jochen Schuemann, Alinghi's sports director and one of its helmsmen, gave a seminar on match racing. Schuemann, a commanding three-time Olympic gold medalist, loomed over a small whiteboard, carefully diagramming match strategy and the tactical geometry that a skipper might employ during a race. Fifteen minutes into this tutorial, one of the bankers shot up his hand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Which is starboard again?'' he asked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Alinghi'' is a nonsense word, invented by Ernesto Bertarelli as a child. In past interviews he has said that he simply enjoyed the sound it made. Of late, he claims the word is a brand, connoting freedom, determination, partnership and cutting-edge technology. (As you might suspect, Bertarelli is a business school graduate.) Because brands require visuals, Bertarelli commissioned a logo in the form of a stylized letter ''a,'' its serif stretched into a pair of circling yachts, representing the portion of a match known as a pre-start. America's Cup racers attach an almost mystical importance to the pre-start. Often described as a boxing match, it more closely resembles a game of musical chairs with mixed-up rules: rather than sprinting to the center when the music stops, the boats break frantically for the starting line, each hoping to nab the side with the better wind.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the current champion, Alinghi did not participate in the Louis Vuitton Cup, having earned a sort of bye. Thus its last opportunity to compete one-on-one against the competition was in a series of races held in Valencia almost a year ago, known as Act 12. In one of Alinghi's last matches of this act, it happened to face New Zealand. Most veteran Cup handicappers I spoke to in Valencia believed that New Zealand would win the Louis Vuitton Cup, and thus meet Alinghi in a rematch of 2003. Should New Zealand win back the America's Cup -- and with it the Deed of Gift -- the speculation is that the team will undo the many changes made by Bertarelli over the past four years. This subtext injects a certain zing into contests between the two teams, and the Act 12 pre-start featuring the two boats was typically dramatic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Barker, a 34-year-old Tom Brady look-alike, skippers New Zealand. In 2003, Barker helmed the New Zealand boat when it lost the Cup; lately, however, he has had success, winning half of his races against Alinghi. With less than 60 seconds remaining in the pre-start, and the boats circling warily, Barker abruptly tacked, taking Alinghi by surprise. He swept behind the Swiss boat, timed the starting gun perfectly and secured the favored side of the course. Alinghi broke for the line as well. Soon the boats, as the race announcer described it, were ''stuck together like a piece of bungee.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Butterworth, an avuncular New Zealander who had been Russell Coutts's second-in-command and is now Alinghi's skipper, inched closer to Barker. (Bertarelli, by the way, is a runner/grinder on the boat -- a situation roughly analogous to Mark Cuban playing power forward for the Dallas Mavericks.) The skippers carved their way upwind, pursued by a chaotic armada of spectators. When they rounded the windward marker, New Zealand held a lead of eight seconds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In racing, the object is not to go fast, exactly, but to make your opponent go slow. One weapon skippers use to achieve this is their boat's wind shadow: the pie-shaped wedge of disturbed air that spills off a yacht. On upwind runs the leading boat uses this weapon to spoil the trailing boat's air. On downwind legs the advantage flips, and the trailing boat tries to steal the leading boat's wind. What typically follows in such situations is a tacking duel, a spectacular stretch of action in which one boat veers wildly, attempting to break free of the other. A duel can require as many as 50 tacks in a single leg, rocketing grinders' heart rates to 200 beats per minute and severely testing a crew's stamina. Boats also suffer horribly, struggling to remain intact as their massive sails fight the 20-ton keel. Yachts signal their distress with a loud array of cracks and pops, and with long, mournful moans. ''They really cry for help, these boats,'' said Christoph Erbelding, an engineer with BMW Oracle. (After a ride aboard an American boat in 2003, Robin Williams remarked that the sound was like that of ''an old man trying to have sex.'')   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Races are 14 miles, with four roughly equal legs. They last about 75 minutes. Alinghi and New Zealand clashed for almost an hour, speeding down the course, rounding and fighting their way upwind, then rounding a final time. In theory, an America's Cup race tests the skill of the crew (on the upwind legs) and the speed of the boat (on the downwind runs). But the reality is more simple, as Koch explained: ''Only fast boats win. And the team that wins is not the most brilliant, but the one that makes the fewest mistakes.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it prepares to defend the Cup, Alinghi drills six days a week, on the water and in the classroom, learning how to react to every conceivable racing situation. Team members practice a method of speaking on the boat, using specific syntax and shifts in tone to signal changes in tactic or an increased level of urgency. They codify a system of making decisions, so that if the strategist clinging to the mast 90 feet in the air spots a stain moving across the water, his message that the wind is about to shift will speed without error through the crew's nervous system and arrive at its brain. ''Nothing's taken for granted,'' Alinghi's John Russell, a boat builder, told me. ''Everything's checked off, everything's looked at, everything's investigated. It's a pretty clinical kind of a team.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the while, Alinghi's scientific advisers -- a Ph.D.-laden bunch from Geneva's renowned Acole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne -- works to replicate George Steers's feat from 146 years ago. (''It's a technology contest,'' one Cup veteran said. ''As it has been since 1851.'') The trick is to build a boat forever on the verge of breaking. ''To make it as light as possible,'' BMW Oracle's Erbelding explained, ''but as strong as possible, too.'' Teams construct their boats to suit the conditions that historically prevail at the venue. But weather is increasingly fickle and forecasting imprecise. In 2003, New Zealand staked the Cup on a boat designed to sail best in light wind and flat water. Conditions, however, turned out to be atypically harsh. During the first race, New Zealand's boat took on so much water it almost sank. In the fourth race, the mast snapped. In the fifth race, the spinnaker broke. Alinghi arrived in Auckland with a boat that happened to be better for the conditions as they existed at that fleeting moment. Because of this good fortune, Bertarelli won his Cup.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten minutes offshore of Valencia, Alinghi and New Zealand entered the final leg of their match. Barker had fought Alinghi through three-quarters of the race, and still held a boat's length advantage. Both crews struggled to find hidden speed. ''Expect kitchen sinks and all sorts to be thrown!'' the announcer said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boats had sailed far to the opposite sides of the course, hunting clear air. Now they turned toward each other, roaring at full power toward a likely collision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last-chance leg!'' the announcer cried. ''What happens now?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bertarelli was poised at his station, calmly focusing his breath before the final charge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here they go!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alinghi bore down on New Zealand from the starboard side, the boats almost close enough to touch, Butterworth pressuring Barker to make a move. New Zealand jibed to block, but Alinghi countered perfectly and slid smoothly past. New Zealand's crew scrambled to regain its advantage. Races hinge on the most minor of miracles -- a shift of wind, a slip of a hand. Barker's boat began to slow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crew error!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A moment later New Zealand's spinnaker spilled its air, sagging sadly from the mast. Alinghi sped across the finish line. ''That's the first time the pressure has gotten to the New Zealand team,'' the announcer said. ''Brilliant sailing by Alinghi.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The America's Cup is the only sport in which a team, if it fails to win the championship, often ceases to exist. (Imagine 31 N.F.L. teams disbanding after the Super Bowl.) Historically, only about one in 10 campaigns continues after a loss. The others vanish, their accounts emptied and syndicates dismantled. Cup historians speak of a ''curse of the America's Cup.'' Men who failed in their quest have lost their families and their fortunes. At least two have committed suicide. ''It's such a public event,'' Bill Koch explained. ''And when you lose, it breaks you.'' Larry Ellison has said, ''All these guys are not exactly having fun. This is extremely stressful stuff. It is a lot more fun to watch than it is to do.'' One team's psychologist told me, ''It's four years of their lives. And it all comes down to whether you win a race or not. That's a terrible thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early one morning in Valencia, I went to see Bertarelli at the Alinghi base. He was seated at a low white table set with fresh strawberries and cream, orange juice and croissants. Bertarelli didn't eat anything, merely sipping his coffee while he piloted a strawberry on a plate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last time,'' he said, ''winning the Cup was a bonus. This time there is no other alternative but winning. No matter how well we would have done in regard to many other aspects of our campaign, we would still be judged a failure. It's what makes sports what it is. It's binary -- you win, you lose. Here, you win, you're on top of the world. You lose, you're nothing. You're gone. You don't exist anymore.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bertarelli's summary seemed a little dire, as did the other all-or-nothing sentiments voiced by those teams who truly expected to win the Cup. It got me wondering. A few weeks after I left Valencia, I sent an e-mail to Xavier de Lesquen, to see how he and his Chinese friends were faring. His reply arrived in the middle of the night. ''Part of the team has left,'' he wrote. ''We keep at Valencia a core team of people to operate the base and welcome the guests. Maybe some days of sailing on Longtze with guests. . . .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as I am concerned -- In Valencia until end of the AC, then jump to Brittany, my home place, to enjoy the life in my small house in front of a lonely beach with my old wooden dinghy. . . .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kind Regards! Xavier.''   </p>

Outside of disruptions caused by labor strikes, G.M. had led the pack for over 75 years. While hardly a cause for celebration in the American business community, Toyota's assumption of the crown -- after selling 2.35 million cars and trucks in its most recent quarter -- is not quite as bad as it appears.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a very important sense -- profitability -- G.M. had not been on top in some time. It fell behind in volume last quarter, by 109,000 vehicles, largely as a result of deciding to reduce its unprofitable bulk sales to rental-car companies and dialing back some of its costlier incentives. More important, analysts say that G.M. has awakened to the challenge posed by Toyota and, although more difficult results lie ahead, the company may finally be moving in the right direction.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As global competition heats up, Americans will have to get used to having more of their companies fall from the top spot. How businesses respond will in no small way determine how well the United States succeeds in a world where it is no longer the unchallenged economic superpower.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major reason that so many American companies were world-beaters in the last century was the unmatched size of their rich and relatively homogenous domestic consumer market, big enough by itself for mass production, and bequeathing all the advantages of economies of scale for competition abroad. The United States economy is still the largest in the world, but ravenous young markets in places like India and China -- each with well over three times the population of America -- make clear that it will not stay that way forever. There will be ever more competitors from all over selling all over, and ready to knock off those in the old guard if they make the wrong choices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is no reason for American business to despair; instead, it has to refocus on how to stay competitive in a world beyond American dominance. Germany's recent success might serve as a model. As Mark Landler wrote in The Times recently, Germany, with the world's third-largest economy, has been the world's largest exporter of goods the last four years. And, Americans who believe protectionism is needed to level the playing field should note, it has managed to do it without cheap labor. German businesses have prospered with a focus on quality and strong brands, and particularly with sophisticated niche products, from lasers to Porsches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's recent success was not accomplished painlessly. There were wrenching layoffs and rounds of cost cutting and outsourcing along the way. General Motors faces a particular set of challenges because in the mass-market automobile game, the huge upfront costs of designing and building cars make sales volume crucial. But Germany's export prowess proves that for a smart industrialized country, many small successes can add up to No. 1.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT, April 25 -- Most years, the United States handily beats Europe for bragging rights in deal making, based on the total value of mergers and acquisitions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, Europe is pulling ahead. The current takeover battle in banking, the biggest in the industry's history, is just the latest sign of the growing deal frenzy on the Continent.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That frenzy is prompting changes in corporate behavior. European companies are scrambling to put themselves in play, or fend off unwanted approaches, much like American companies did in the 1980s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's deal mania reflects a number of trends: more active shareholders, particularly hedge funds; an influx of private equity money; low interest rates; and a wealth of European companies with valuable assets that are ripe for the picking, in some cases because they have been poorly managed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Shareholder activism and hedge funds are acting as a trigger to doing more restructuring kinds of deals,'' said Alexander Dibelius, the head of Goldman Sachs in Germany. ''In combination with private equity and cheap money, this adds to the perceived increase in deal making."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is more than just perception. So far this year, the value of mergers and acquisitions announced in Europe is $656.4 billion, compared with $601.4 billion in the United States, according to Thomson Financial (Europe also led in 1990, 1991 and 2002).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's new economic buoyancy is also providing a tailwind to dealmakers here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth rates in Europe are approaching those in the United States, and Europe may outperform the United States this year if the American economy slows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany, in particular, is booming, with soaring investor confidence and heavy capital spending. Companies are reporting record profits, as they reap the benefits of years of painful overhauls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having retrenched thoroughly, European companies are emerging with leaner cost structures and loftier ambitions. The German energy giant, Eon, for example, made a 42 billion euro ($57 billion) bid for its Spanish counterpart, Endesa -- a deal that eventually collapsed because of resistance by the Spanish.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deal underscores a hurdle to deals in Europe, particularly cross-border ones: protectionism is alive and well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political leaders in France, Italy, and Spain speak unabashedly about keeping national assets from foreign buyers. Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative front-runner for the French presidency, promises to maintain France's tradition of defending ''national champions'' in crucial industries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Germany, the former head of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Muntefering, scored points during the last election by referring to foreign hedge funds and private equity investors as heuschrecken, or locusts, intent on plundering German assets and mistreating workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While European executives are generally more open to cross-border deals than politicians, some play the nationalist card when it suits them, to ward off unwanted suitors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porsche, the German sports car maker, has amassed a more than 30 percent stake in Volkswagen, justifying its action by saying it is trying to fend off a potential takeover by foreign private-equity investors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears of hostile approaches by financial investors have helped fuel the efforts of DaimlerChrysler to unload its money-losing Chrysler division, according to executives at the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may have even played a role in the abrupt ouster Wednesday of the chief executive of Siemens, the engineering giant, which has been hit by a corruption scandal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with ties to Siemens said members of its board were worried that if it did not get past the scandal, the company would be vulnerable to a takeover bid by a private equity firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is ample evidence that hedge funds and other foreign investors are shaking Europe out of it old habits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABN Amro's negotiations with Barclays were started in part by pressure from the Children's Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, which owns less than 3 percent of ABN Amro.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, bankers here said, it would have been inconceivable for a hedge fund to force one of Europe's largest banks to, in effect, put itself in play.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2005, the Children's Investment Fund waged a fax and e-mail campaign against the management of Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, which was seeking to take over the London Stock Exchange.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only did Deutsche Borse end up having to abandon the bid, but the company's chief executive and its chairman were forced to resign.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Central Bank has done its part to keep business humming. While the bank began tightening credit at the end of 2005, its key rate of 4 percent is still below that of the Federal Reserve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists expect that the bank will move cautiously in raising rates further.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Fran Coover, her new business, Ladies in White, seemed a perfect way to blend her interest in the environment and alternatives to the American way of dying. ''It's much less expensive,'' Ms. Coover said. ''And it is far more environmentally benign.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $390 Ms. Coover, a former administrator at a project studying end-of-life care here, along with two other ladies, offered to scatter the ashes of clients and provide a ceremony, a photograph, journal notes and Global Positioning System coordinates of the final resting place. Ten percent of the cost would be donated to groups who work to protect wild lands.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after Ms. Coover scattered the cremated remains of her first client, she applied to the federal Forest Service, one of Montana's largest owners of wild land, for a special-use permit to continue her business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some officials told her it was fine to scatter the ashes on public land, she says, officials from Region I of the Forest Service, which covers Montana and Idaho, said it was against national policy and denied a permit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She took her request to the Bureau of Land Management, the largest of the country's federal land management agencies. At first the bureau seemed fine with it, she says, until it sent out an e-mail message to stakeholders, or groups with an interest in public lands, and ran into opposition from Indian tribes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exasperated at the barriers, Ms. Coover said, she is preparing appeals. ''Three women in white dresses and hiking boots want to carry a pack on their back into a wilderness area,'' she said. ''How harmful can that be? Does it make sense for people to have land they love logged or torn up by mines, but not available to have ashes scattered?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Forest Service has long had a firm policy against commercial scattering, said Gordon Schofield, the group leader for land use here in Region I. If ashes are scattered ''the land takes on a sacredness, and people want to put up a marker or a plaque,'' Mr. Schofield said, then they oppose activities they do not see as compatible with the site as a resting place.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Forest Service has a version of a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for private individuals who want to scatter the ashes of a loved one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't prohibit it, but we don't authorize it,'' Mr. Schofield said. ''People should do what they think is right.'' But an allowed commercial enterprises require a permit, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilderness Watch, a conservation group, opposes dissemination of human remains in wilderness areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I understand wilderness is sacred ground and many people feel closer to the Creator there than they do in church,'' said George Nickas, the group's executive director. ''But it's also a place where commercial enterprise is not allowed. I think the prohibition on Ladies in White is the right thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nickas said he would allow the women to scatter ashes on public land that is not wilderness because ''we allow all kinds of commercial activity'' on such land.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As people turn to nontraditional ways of disposing of their loved ones' remains, ash-scattering businesses have blossomed. Families can choose to have ashes scattered in a variety of ways, including from a helium balloon or an airplane flying over an ocean or a volcano.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Britain, a company called Heavens Above Fireworks, sends remains into the sky in ''a spectacular fireworks display.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While she appeals the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management decisions, Ms. Coover said, she is negotiating with a private landowner, a rancher, to scatter ashes on his mountain property.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cremation is growing by the year,'' she said, ''and people are looking for a place to scatter. The public land is public legacy, and it's where ashes belong.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanzania and Ghana catapulted this year into the ranks of the top 10 reformers. Rwanda and Nigeria made it into the top 20.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 26 other African countries took modest steps to ease business regulations ''by the stroke of a minister's pen,'' the report noted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa, the world's poorest region, currently has the highest tax rates and some of its most convoluted and antiquated business regulations. In every African country, most businesses operate underground, beyond the reach of regulators and tax collectors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Authors of the report, ''Doing Business,'' by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, the bank's private sector arm, say they hope simplifying and easing the rules of the capitalist game will entice more businesses above ground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of 30 researchers found that African countries had made many incremental changes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most surprising thing for me was to see the pickup of reform in Africa,'' said Simeon Djankov, a World Bank economist who four years ago developed the rankings on the ease of doing business. ''Something has happened this year. At least two-thirds of Africa's countries have at least one positive reform.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanzania computerized its business and tax registries and reduced delays in customs inspections and the courts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ghana has cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, from 32.5 percent, and made it easier to export goods.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rwanda scrapped a law adopted during Belgian colonial rule that had given one official a monopoly on notarizing documents for the entire country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivory Coast slashed the time to register property to a month from more than a year by eliminating a requirement that the urban minister give his consent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy donors like the World Bank, the United States and Britain, which focus on spurring economic growth and job creation, are putting heavier emphasis on such changes in deciding where to provide aid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Millennium Challenge Account, President Bush's aid program, explicitly uses the bank report's measure of days to start a business as one criterion for deciding who qualifies for large grants.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists outside the bank say the wealth of statistical information and rankings are useful to countries seeking to improve their investment climates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they also caution that scoring well in the rankings is no guarantee of economic growth and no substitute for a broader economic strategy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just one piece of the puzzle,'' said William Easterly, a former bank economist who is now an economist at New York University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist, said the report focused on steps that got government out of the way -- like cutting taxes and regulations -- but he said that countries often needed governments that encouraged industries through subsidies, preferential tax policies or special economic zones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's assumed is that if government provides the right environment for property rights, contract enforcement and low taxes these economies will take off, but in actual fact, economic development requires a government more actively involved with the private sector,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Djankov, an author of the report, agreed that there were things a government could do that might be more important to economic development than the factors in the report. For example, he said, building a port might make be significant but it could also cost billions of dollars and take years to complete, unlike the changes in the report. ''These reforms are very cheap and easy to do for a government,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's ''Doing Business'' report ranked 175 countries by the number of days it takes to start a business and on other indicators that measure contract enforcement, investor protections, corporate taxation levels and the flexibility businesses have to hire and fire workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nations the bank named as the top 10 reformers were, from the best, Georgia, Romania, Mexico, China, Peru, France, Croatia, Guatemala, Ghana and Tanzania. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and wealthy Western nations were the leading regions, followed by Africa. This year, South Asia brought up the rear.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, American companies are flush with cash. That has led many economists and policymakers to predict that an upsurge in business investment will smooth the sharp edges of the next economic slowdown. The thinking goes like this: As consumers retrench in the face of higher gas prices, higher interest rates and staggering household debt, companies will pick up the slack by spending their accumulated fortunes on equipment, technology and factories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such thinking may turn out to be more wishful than wise. Corporate America has been piling up cash for some time, yet business spending has not been particularly robust. It's not in the doldrums, but it's not on a tear, either.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And instead of investing, many companies are choosing to distribute their cash to shareholders. The preferred method for doing so, by far, is to buy back the company's own stock. Buybacks benefit shareholders because they reduce the number of shares outstanding. That, in turn, boosts the earnings per share, and generally the price, of the remaining shares.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported this week that in the year ending on March 31, companies spent a record $367 billion in stock buybacks, an extraordinary amount. And, The Journal reported, the torrid pace of buybacks is expected to continue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's nothing wrong with returning money to shareholders. But companies generally do so only when they can't find a better alternative. In general, buybacks are an indication that there are no investments on the horizon that represent a superior use of the company's money. Another downside to buybacks is that they can give a false impression of corporate performance. Higher earnings per share are generally thought to result from real improvements, like higher sales. But buybacks can enhance the stock price -- and thus mollify unhappy investors -- without increasing overall earnings. So, on the one hand, buybacks are a sign that good investments may be lacking. On the other, they can give investors the impression that the good times are rolling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mixed signals are to be expected when the economy is in transition, as it is now. What's important for policymakers is to avoid complacency that comes with thinking there's a silver bullet -- like business investment -- for escaping the worst potential effects of a slowdown.   </p>

The survey's index, compiled by the Center for European Economic Research, fell to 62.7 points in April, from 63.4 points in March. While expectations in April were probably helped by an increase in new orders, they ''may have been negatively influenced by the risk of a general slowdown of the world economy and the high oil price,'' the research center said. The survey, a leading indicator for the German economy, has been slipping since it reached 71 points in January. The center, which is based in Mannheim, interviewed 316 analysts and institutional investors for the survey.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finland once again ended up in first place in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks 117 countries, while four other Nordic countries made the top 10. The United States, the world's largest economy, again ended up in second place.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study assigned scores to nations by looking at factors like government economic policy, the strength of local institutions and the degree to which technology has been used to bolster growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan fell to 12th place, from 9th; Britain slipped to 13th, from 11th; Germany dropped to 15th place, from 13th. Spain fell to 29th, from 23rd; and France fell to 30th, from 27th. Italy remained in 47th place, between Greece and Botswana.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''High labor market rigidities, and, in particular, the ease of hiring and firing, contribute to explaining why Europe lags behind U.S. performance,'' Beatrice Weder di Mauro, an economics professor at Mainz University, wrote in a paper for the forum. ''Improving the flexibility of labor markets should be high on Europe's reform agenda.'' Japan's rating fell because of ''the deterioration of its public finances,'' she wrote, though it the country more than compensated for it with its ''impressive technology performance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nordic countries, in contrast, drew praise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margareta Drzeniek, a senior economist at the World Economic Forum, said, ''The reasons for the strong performance by the Nordic countries is that they have very transparent systems, high levels of technology penetration, a well-educated work force and good macroeconomic management.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African and Latin American nations filled most of the bottom spots, with Chad in last place. Two of Latin America's largest economies fell in the rankings: Mexico to 55th place, from 48th, and Brazil to 65th, from 57th. Chile, however, came in 23rd, outscoring some of the European Union economies on government transparency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance of the Asian economies was mixed. Many of the so-called tiger economies in Asia ranked well, with Taiwan in fifth place and Singapore sixth. Tiger economy countries are nations that achieve high growth by pursuing an export-driven trade strategy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest gains came in South Korea, which jumped to 17th place, from 29th last year, in part because of high scores in technology. The World Economic Forum report said that rapid growth in China and India, which placed 49th and 50th, respectively, could be threatened in the long term by factors like poor education systems and low use of technology. These factors were ''likely to slow down their ascension to the top tier of the most competitive economies in the world.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China dropped from 46th place, while India rose from 55th. China and India lagged in the index because of ''serious problems'' with corruption, bureaucracy and education, Ms. Drzeniek said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high rankings of Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Norway highlighted the countries' ability to foster a climate in which business can flourish while they also run large social welfare systems. Their success can in part be explained by high taxes, which most citizens accept in exchange for free health care and education, affordable child care and generous unemployment benefits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the high taxes have not discouraged entrepreneurs. The World Economic Forum praised Finland, home to global companies like Nokia, as ''one of the most innovative business environments in the world.'' The forum also highlighted Finland's ability to run a budget surplus while many European countries face large deficits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States remains at the cutting edge of technology, the report said, citing its ''pipeline of innovation second to none in the world.'' But a growing budget deficit and other macroeconomic concerns kept it out of the top spot, according to the report.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unexpectedly upbeat result of the central bank's closely watched Tankan survey of about 10,000 companies suggests that the economy continues to recover from a shallow recession last year as domestic demand grows.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence improved in most categories of businesses, though large companies remained significantly more upbeat than small ones.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark index of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 of Japan's biggest companies, rose to 18 in June, from 14 in March. The index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of companies that say conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. A positive score means the optimists outnumber the pessimists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said one of the most encouraging parts of the report was a strong improvement in confidence among service companies, like banks and department stores. Confidence among large service companies rose to 15 in June, the highest level since 1992, from 11 in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that a wide range of companies are becoming more optimistic even as exports remain relatively weak shows that businesses think that consumption may be strengthening after years of stagnation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the last decade, growth in the Japanese economy has been driven primarily by exports. Though robust export growth has generated a series of relatively strong recoveries in recent years, each has been short-lived because demand at home has lagged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last year, the economy has shown new signs of life. Banks have cleaned up the bad loans that once saddled their industry, and many big companies are hiring again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy is coming back onto a normal footing,'' said Stefan Worrall, an economist in Tokyo for Credit Suisse First Boston Securities. ''This is obviously feeding into the confidence we are seeing. Sentiment among manufacturers has been surprisingly resilient.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's unemployment rate remained at a six-year low of 4.4 percent in May, unchanged from April, according to a separate government report. Another report released Friday showed vehicle sales rose 8.6 percent in June from a year earlier.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, April 1 -- Japanese corporate leaders are much less optimistic about business prospects than they were three months ago as they worry about fading export growth, a widely followed Bank of Japan survey showed Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprisingly sharp deterioration in the central bank's quarterly Tankan report of business sentiment suggests that it is taking longer than expected for Japan, the world's second-largest economy, to emerge from a slowdown that began last year.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found that while a majority of executives were still optimistic about Japan's economy, the number of optimists was falling fast amid worries about rising commodity prices and prospects for the country's all-important exporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important index in the survey, which measures economic sentiment among large manufacturers, sank to 14 from 22 three months ago. The index score was much lower than the reading of 23 that economists forecast and the lowest level since a score of 12 a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index score is calculated by subtracting the number of executives who say business conditions are deteriorating from those who say conditions are improving. A positive score means a majority of respondents are upbeat about their businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the large decline was a surprise to many economists who have been expecting the economic environment to improve this year after a soft patch that began a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's surprising that the survey has slipped so much when it appears from a lot of the other monthly data that things are actually starting to improve again,'' said Richard Jerram, an economist at Macquarie Securities. ''These numbers are surprisingly conservative; in fact, they are worse than conservative.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing export growth weighed on the survey result, economists said. Exports from Japan increased by 1.7 percent in February from a year earlier, the smallest increase in more than a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports of autos, machinery and electronic gadgets are crucial to the Japanese economy because they have been the only consistent source of growth over the last several years. A prolonged slowdown in exports now would drag on the economy, particularly because there are few signs of a pickup in consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of Japan's economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The basic problem is that the main driver of growth is still exports, and we just sort of have to wait and see how exports come in,'' said Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. ''We need to see some pickup in exports to get the overall expansion going again.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the central bank's survey of 10,344 companies, which was conducted in late February and March, respondents said they did not expect business conditions to change much over the next three months. Executives forecast the large-manufacturer's index would be unchanged at 14 next quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak survey result was the latest in a string of disappointing economic figures. This week, the government reported that industrial production sank 2.1 percent in February from the month before as demand for electronic machinery weakened. Japan's unemployment rate unexpectedly crept up to 4.7 percent in February from 4.5 percent in March and consumer spending slowed more than anticipated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recent lackluster numbers have not changed the view, shared by most economists, that the pace of growth will pick up in the first quarter of this year from the annual rate of 0.5 percent recorded for the last quarter of 2004. And with the United States and Chinese economies expanding steadily, demand for Japanese cars, televisions and factory equipment should remain strong, economists say.  </p>

The Ifo Institute's business sentiment index fell to 94.0 in March, from 95.4 in February, below economists' forecast of 95.5. February's index was revised down from 95.5. ''Unfortunately, indications are strengthening of a decreasing economic dynamic,'' Ifo's president, Hans-Werner Sinn, said. ''In particular, the hoped-for recovery in demand for investment goods has not yet materialized.'' Mr. Sinn said that German industry remained optimistic about its export prospects, but sentiment among retailers continued to worsen. With unemployment at 12.6 percent in February, German consumers remain reluctant to spend amid fears of joblessness.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, Dec. 15 -- Confidence at Japan's largest companies fell in the last quarter from a recent peak, but executives nonetheless said they planned to sharply increase capital investment in the year through March, a central bank survey showed on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business offered some hope that Japan's current slowdown would not turn into a recession. The survey's headline index of confidence among large manufacturers slipped to 22 from a 13-year high of 26 in the previous quarter, as economic growth slowed substantially.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the index was the first since March 2003, but was no surprise after Japan nearly slipped into recession in the third quarter on weakened exports and consumer spending. The economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.2 percent in the third quarter after expanding at a rapid pace of more than 6 percent in the first quarter of the year. The economy shrank at a 0.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures on corporate spending plans were the bright spot in the survey. Large manufacturers plan to increase capital investment 23.4 percent for the year ending March 31, 2005, up from a forecast 20.7 percent increase in the previous survey. If companies follow through on those plans, the increase in capital spending will be the largest in 16 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Japanese economy is weak at this moment, but we can expect an acceleration in capital investment from now so that should prevent the economy from entering into a recession in the near future,'' said Mamoru Yamazaki, chief economist for Barclays Capital in Tokyo. ''Over all, the situation is not so bad.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large manufacturers also raised their sales and profit outlooks compared with the previous quarter. The survey showed that the manufacturers now expect profits to rise 24 percent for the year ending next March compared with the previous year, up 5.1 percentage points from the previous survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A considerable increase in capital spending would be a big help to an economy that has little else going for it right now. Stagnant income growth has kept consumers from spending freely, and the dollar's weakness over the last several months poses risks to the country's all-important export sector. A decline in the dollar against the yen reduces the revenue Japanese companies earn overseas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large manufacturers surveyed in the report said they expected the confidence index to sink to 15 for the quarter ending in March, suggesting they see business conditions worsening.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is often the case, smaller companies and service providers continued to be less optimistic than large manufacturers, though neither group showed a deterioration in their outlooks. The index for large service companies was unchanged from three months earlier at 11, while the confidence score among small manufacturers was unchanged at 5.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses are bullish, albeit cautiously, about the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the gist of three surveys released last week by American Express, the CIT Group and MasterCard International. Each company found that a majority of entrepreneurs expect either their businesses or the economy to improve within the next six months or longer.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small-business owners are an optimistic bunch,'' said Doreen Amano, a vice president at MasterCard, ''even when thing are not looking good currently, they're thinking of ways to rebrand or to start a new business to adjust.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MasterCard survey of 1,145 small-business owners ''and financial decision makers'' found that 33 percent expect a ''substantially better year, and 42 percent expect a ''slightly better'' year for their businesses in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Express survey more pointedly asked 773 small-business owners and managers how they viewed the economy. Only 14 percent thought that the economy would negatively affect their businesses (although the numbers were slightly higher in the Midwest); 44 percent thought that business would grow no matter how the economy fared (with numbers higher in the Northeast) and 30 percent said they believed that the economy would improve and that their businesses would expand along with it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Sobbott, the president of American Express's small-business division, said the negative outlook was the lowest in the two years that the company had conducted the survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In CIT's survey of 448 small businesses, done with Business Week Research Services, 28 percent of respondents ''strongly agreed'' with the statement that they were confident about the future of the economy, while 40 percent said they agreed somewhat with that sentiment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the upbeat mood, the proof, at least in retailing, is in the inventory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Sorensen owns the Penn Cycle Corporation, a chain of six bicycle and fitness stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The company had a ''flat year'' Mr. Sorensen said, largely because of a rainy spring and an unusually cool summer. While Mr. Sorensen is ''optimistic that we couldn't have weather as bad as this year, I'm basing my ordering on having a flat year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although his vendors, high-end bicycle makers like Trek Bicycle and Giant Bicycle, would like him to order at least six months in advance, he tries to order four months before the selling season that begins at the end of March. And if his business is better than expected? He hopes his status as a big client will assure additional deliveries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the notoriously fickle clothing business, store owners are showing signs of optimism, but are similarly placing conservative orders. Steven Roberts, president of the Echo Design Group, which sells scarves, other accessories and home products to both large and small stores, said orders from smaller specialty stores were up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Traditionally, stores buy anywhere from three to six months out, but increasingly, it's harder for retailers to predict that far in advance,'' he said. ''As a result, people tend to be a little more cautious and buy closer to when the consumer is ready to make a purchase.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some of the surveys included a breakdown of industries responding, none correlated levels of optimism with types of business. The toy industry, for example, seems less sanguine about the near future, particularly after the two giants, Mattel and Hasbro, posted disappointing third-quarter results. And those in the novelty market are also not expecting an increase in 2005 sales. Nigel Febland, whose company, the Febland Group in New York, sells seasonal and novelty products with an emphasis on Halloween to both chains and independent stores, finds that ''consumers are coming into the stores and buying later'' and says that retail sales are either ''flat or down.'' He said that he could not predict next year's season until he received his ''sell-throughs'' for this Halloween, although he hoped there would be ''a strong kick at the end.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those who have done well throughout the recent recession are not willing to predict that the future will be as sunny. Leigh Ballen, president of Developers Inc., a real estate firm in Chicago, said: ''I think we've been riding a wave that others haven't had the benefit of. I have a new fear, because I don't know how long people will stay in the market when interest rates go up.'' His company, he said, ''hedges by being in the starter market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residual uncertainty may emanate from the barrage of disparate economic indicators announced of late. A recent survey conducted by the University of Michigan, for example, showed that consumer confidence, buffeted by high gas prices, slow job growth and the war, had dropped slightly in September, although still ahead of last year's levels. Despite those uncertain results, the Department of Commerce, in figures released last Friday, found that retail and food sales were up 7.7 percent from September 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national employment picture, also lackluster, could get a small lift from some small businesses next year. American Express found that 35 percent of respondents plan to hire in the next six months, a drop from the April survey, but above the 26 percent that reported planning to hire in 2002. Similarly, MasterCard found that one-third of the small businesses it surveyed expected to increase staff, while 65 percent expected staffing to remain the same.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sorensen of Penn Cycle, for example, said he planned to keep his staff at about the same level next year. But Gerry Hartung, president of Physician Practice, a medical publishing and education company in Glen Burnie, Md., said his company had been slow to hire and was ''probably overworking our current staff.'' Still, he said, his company had hired 13 people this year and planned to hire four more and even more next year. ''If we don't put people in place,'' he said, we ''won't be able to take advantage of the economy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of small businesses plan on making some capital improvements in the coming year. According to the American Express survey, 61 percent do, virtually unchanged from last year but up slightly from October 2002. The CIT/Business Week survey found that 60 percent planned on investing in technology, but only 22 percent in their facilities or property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is controlled optimism,'' said John Canning, president of the CIT Small Business Lending Corporation. ''Businesses want to invest in the future, but it is not a huge expansionary time.'' Companies that have already experienced an improved market, however, are more likely to make capital investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Bruss, who has run a design firm in Denver since 1990, said: ''A year ago, we were doing estimates, but people would take a long time and have a tendency to revise and retrofit to their needs. Now people are coming to us with clear objectives of what they want to get done'' and want the work done quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, she has increased her staff and is planning to buy a larger building to house her expanding firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I own the place I'm now in, but I am looking at a building that is twice the size, although I would need to lease some of the space,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those involved in leasing retail space have seen some increased activity based on ''pent-up demand for decent areas,'' according to Brian Moss, the vice president of the Shopping Center Realty Corporation in Greenwich, Conn., which handles the leasing and property management of retail space. But expansion, he said, was ''more the exception than the rule.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, those experiencing an uptick in business are willing to invest. Ken Giddon, president of Rothman's, a small men's clothing chain, for example, has just finished renovating his flagship men's shop in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I have put more money into the business in the last year than in any year in the last 15,'' Mr. Giddon said. ''I'm feeling more comfortable than I have in years.'' His company also has stores in Southampton and Scarsdale, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Giddon said the men's apparel business was a ''good barometer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The easiest thing for men to put off is buying clothes, because it's not high on their hierarchy of needs,'' he said. ''When our business goes up, it's a good indicator for the economy. We have had an incredibly strong first eight months this year, although I have seen in the last two months a softening. But I believe that is related to the election.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at sprawling car plants in the city of Valencia, southwest of Caracas, production this year is up sharply. Eli Lilly &amp; Company, maker of impotence drugs, Prozac and insulin, is expecting sales to shoot up.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is all part of an economic rebound that, economists say, could lead to growth rates of 10 to 12 percent this year, nearly double the government's initial forecasts. The rise in Venezuela's economy, Latin America's fourth largest, is helping to drive what the United Nations says will be a 4 percent expansion in Latin America this year, the biggest since 1997.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Venezuela's left-leaning government, which has been fending off threats to remain in power, the economy's rebound could not have come a moment too soon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing a recall referendum on Sunday that could end President Hugo Chavez's turbulent five years in office, the economic boom -- driven by soaring oil prices that have left Venezuela awash in petro-dollars -- is spurring heavy government spending on social programs that are having the desired effect: solidifying support when the president needs it most.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the government celebrates, Venezuela's economy is anything but healthy, after a two-year contraction that some economists call one of the biggest free falls in Latin America in years.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crippled by antigovernment strikes in 2002 that went into 2003, production at Venezuela's large government-owned oil company at one point slowed to a trickle.

''Still, you're not back at the level you were two years ago. All told, this is still an economy that hasn't recovered.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driven by world oil prices that are approaching $45 a barrel, oil revenues have risen 120 percent in last 12 months, and nonoil revenue has nearly doubled, LatinSource, a network of economists based in New York, said in a recent report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic indicators, though, gloss over an economy unable to attract much foreign investment or create jobs for the 50 percent of Venezuelan laborers who toil in the informal sector, selling on the street or running unregulated businesses. Hamstrung by stringent exchange controls and an unpredictable political situation, many local businesses have been unable to grow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly what you're seeing is a normalization of activity at quite a low level,'' said Michael Gavin, chief economist for UBS in Stamford, Conn. ''They recovered from the heart attack, but the cancer is there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, economic indicators show that Venezuela attracted only $1.4 billion in foreign direct investment in 2003, down from $4.3 billion in 1998, according to Mr. Gavin's calculations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central government is also running deficits as spending rises to $26.9 billion this year from $24.3 billion last year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse First Boston. The budget deficit is expected to be about 5.9 percent of gross domestic product this year, First Boston said, and rise to 6.7 percent next year. The gap was less than 2 percent of gross domestic product in 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current fiscal stance is unsustainable,'' said the bank in a report on Aug. 6, explaining that although high oil prices have permitted more spending, the government will be hit hard when prices drop. The report, written after a visit to Venezuela, said that First Boston researchers ''saw nothing during our visit to change our broadly negative long-term view of Venezuela.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chavez government dismisses such assessments, saying that its social spending generates jobs and that the country's fiscal condition is healthy. Venezuela is, indeed, well regarded for paying its debts on time, and its international reserves have shot up to nearly $24 billion, from $15 billion in 1998.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a government that shows it can come back,'' said Ricardo Dorado, vice minister of labor, explaining that much of the country's free fall was brought about by opposition groups. ''There is now a recovery.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a comeback can be found in sectors like auto production, retail sales and, little by little, construction, which is taking its first baby steps after lean years when building practically reached a standstill.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ford Motor Company in Valencia said that about 140 cars and trucks were being built each day -- about 50 percent more than last year -- by 1,600 workers, 450 more than last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the automobile industry in this land of big cars and cheap gas may build 120,000 cars and trucks this year, twice the number of 2003. It falls far short of the 217,000 vehicles made in 2001, but executives say they are pleased nevertheless.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Ford, this has been an excellent year,'' said Enmanuel Cassingena, president of Ford Andina, which also oversees production in Colombia and Ecuador. With its new compact cars, Ford has a 21.7 percent market share in Venezuela, 5.6 percent more than at this point last year, Mr. Cassingena said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sector has rebounded faster than we had thought,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Caracas, other sectors that have registered upticks include construction, up 19.5 percent in the first quarter; retailing, up 27.9 percent, and transport and storage, which grew 25.3 percent. Manufacturing over all, including car production, increased 50 percent in the first three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Botti, who represents retailers and runs several businesses, said his 47-year-old family-run company, a hardware wholesaler called Padlock, has expanded into several business lines. He provides high-technology hardware to the telecommunications industry and is opening a big food wholesaler.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has flourished,'' Mr. Botti said of his business. ''We are being reborn.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But under the rosy surface, he explained, is an ailing economy. Some big competitors have gone out of business, a trend seen across the country and leading to a concentration of companies. And he notes that the encouraging economic data this year hide the fact that the growth rates are being compared with the period last year, when the economy was paralyzed and near collapse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have is a debacle -- we have more people and a smaller economy,'' he said. ''The government holds it all up as a success, but what you see is lost business and a lack of competitors.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction, considered a barometer of the economy, is also in a delicate position. Companies are building schools in the government's drive to bolster education. A metro system, is being built in Los Teques, outside Caracas, and in the capital the subway is being expanded. Some big projects, like a bridge over the Orinoco River and a major highway, are also moving forward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alvarez, the builder whose company was started in 1970, is embarking on an upscale complex of 300 apartments, called Sun Views, in Caracas and a project of 700 more units in Valencia. But Mr. Alvarez, who also represents realtors, says that is a tepid start.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, only 9,000 apartment units and houses were built, down from 92,000 in 1997, according to the leading builders' association in Caracas. In all, construction in 2003 accounted for a third of the economic activity it generated in 2001. The industry has 550,000 workers, down from 1.1 million during the 1970's construction boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the economy reviving, Mr. Alvarez is somewhat optimistic that his and other companies will soon see better days. But he says there are hurdles of all kinds, from more cautious buyers to a lack of credit to political uncertainty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are projects that are ready to get off the ground,'' he said. ''But, of course, the purchasing power of people is not where it should be.''   </p>

The nationwide consumer confidence index rose to 48.7 in July, from 44.9 in June. The July score was the highest since the index hit 49.4 in June of 1991. The improvement in confidence bodes well for Japan's two-year economic recovery. While the rebound has been driven mostly by rising exports so far, signs of growing consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, are providing hope the recovery will continue into a third year.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, July 1 -- Business is better than at any time since the collapse of the bubble economy a dozen years ago, according to a survey of Japanese companies released Thursday by the central bank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprisingly strong results of the Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan survey of some 10,000 companies showed that the two-year economic recovery remains on track. A wide range of businesses -- from conglomerates to restaurants -- said they were optimistic about their prospects, which reinforces the view that recovery has spread beyond exports, the main driver of growth so far.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Tankan suggests that this indeed is the strongest recovery in the post-bubble era,'' said Ryo Hino, an economist at J.P. Morgan Securities Asia. ''It confirms that business conditions continue to improve and that the improvement is widespread.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey's benchmark index of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 companies, rose to plus 22 in June, from plus 12 in March. The index measures sentiment by subtracting the percentage of companies that say conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. A positive score means optimists outnumber pessimists. The latest figure was the highest since August 1991, and was the fifth consecutive increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most optimistic companies were steel makers, which have experienced growth thanks to strong demand from Chinese factories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index for large nonmanufacturers rose to plus 9 in June, from plus 5 in March, and was the best score since February 1992, as restaurants and transportation companies grew more optimistic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing confidence among smaller companies and service providers, which depend closely on domestic demand, was seen as especially encouraging because it suggests a recovery in consumption in Japan. That element was missing from two earlier recoveries that fizzled out in the last decade as initial bursts of export growth faded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also showed that companies planned to invest more. Big businesses said that they planned to increase investment an average of 5.7 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2005, compared with an average 0.6 percent cut in investment that they planned just three months ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rosy survey results follow a period of robust expansion for Japan. The economy grew at an annual 6.1 percent in the first quarter after expanding 7.3 percent in the last quarter of 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the solid numbers, some economists still harbor doubts about how much longer Japan's growth spurt will last. Growth for the economy as a whole still depends to a great extent on exports to China and the United States, leaving Japan vulnerable to a slowdown in the United States and to attempts by Chinese central bankers to slow that country's expansion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in the yen against the dollar could also take some of the steam out of the recovery as a stronger Japanese currency would make exports less profitable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, there are few signs that ordinary Japanese consumers share the optimism of the country's businesses. The job market has been slowly improving but unemployment among the young remains high. And though Japanese corporations have become much more profitable in recent years, many of the gains have come at the expense of ordinary workers who have seen their wages fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Thursday's survey presented a mixed outlook for the months ahead. Large manufacturers expect business conditions to deteriorate slightly in the next three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Firms are expecting a higher yen, which is one of the risk factors for the economy,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo. ''We expect some adjustment phase for the Japanese economic recovery early next year.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, April 1 -- Executives at Japan's biggest manufacturers are more optimistic about business than at any time in nearly seven years, and the mood is spreading among smaller companies, a survey by the central bank showed on Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan survey of 10,562 companies showed that the two-year-old recovery, so far driven by strong overseas demand for Japanese cars, electronics and machinery, is seeping into other sectors.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey showed improved confidence among service providers and smaller companies that rely on domestic consumer demand, which has shown signs of resurgence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey was seen as further evidence that this recovery has more staying power than two short-lived upturns in the last decade that were driven initially by exports but dried up when consumers at home failed to spend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The survey shows the Japanese economy is expanding broadly,'' said Mamoru Yamazaki, chief economist at Barclays Capital (Japan) Ltd. ''I believe the economy will accelerate, particularly in the second half.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey's benchmark subindex of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 companies, rose to plus 12 in March, from plus 7 in December. The latest figure was the highest since June 1997, when the index was plus 13, and was the fourth consecutive increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index for large nonmanufacturers rose to plus 5 in March, from zero in December as retailers, real estate companies and other service providers grew more optimistic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's indexes measure business sentiment by subtracting the percentage of companies that say business conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. Economists say growing optimism in the service sector reflects expectations for more consumer spending, which accounts for about 60 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. Reports of recent pickups in household spending and retail sales are reinforcing that view.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing confidence in Japan's recovery has helped lift the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average 9.4 percent so far this year. The Nikkei closed at 11,683.42 on Thursday, down 0.27 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One caveat economists noted is that the survey was completed before the yen surged against the dollar this week. A rising yen hurts Japanese exporters, like Toyota and Sony, by reducing the value of their dollar-denominated profits when changed into yen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big companies in the survey forecast an average exchange rate of 108.43 yen per dollar for the fiscal year ending March 2005, but the yen has already strengthened beyond that, trading at 103.73 to the dollar on Thursday from as weak as 112 last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the improved sentiment at smaller manufacturers and service providers, companies in those categories remained overwhelmingly pessimistic. The survey's index for small companies improved to minus 3 in March from minus 10 in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists say Japanese companies still face challenges, especially smaller companies that depend on demand at home. While the country's long-deteriorating job market seems to be stabilizing, there are few signs that wages are rising, a necessity for a healthy recovery in consumer demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sustainability of the current recovery is still uncertain,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps reflecting the uncertainty about exchange rates and the strength of consumer demand, large companies surveyed did not see conditions continuing to improve. Large manufacturers forecast their index would hold steady at plus 12 for June, the same level as in March.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment has unexpectedly risen this month, suggesting that tax refunds and an accelerating economy are giving Americans reasons for optimism even as job growth lags.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment for March rose to 95.8, from 94.4 in February. Economists had expected a final reading of 93.7 in the gauge, according to the median of 52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The preliminary reading for March was 94.1.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income tax rebates are up 5 percent on average from last year and forecasts call for the fastest pace of economic growth in two decades. That may be helping to buoy consumers until companies step up the pace of hiring. Declines in the stock market, a surge in gasoline prices and the March 11 terrorist attack in Madrid still weighed on attitudes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We suspect that soaring tax refunds are offsetting the Madrid effect, as well as the impact of higher gas prices and the dip in stocks,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Rising sentiment ''will help perceptions of the strength of the recovery.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Commerce Department yesterday said spending by consumers rose 0.2 percent in February, the fifth consecutive increase, after a 0.5 percent gain in January. Incomes rose 0.4 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final Michigan index is based on a survey of about 500 households, double the sample size of the preliminary finding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's expectations index, which measures optimism about the next one to five months, rose to 88.8, from 88.5 a month earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-conditions index, based on perceptions of consumers' financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, rose to 106.8, from 103.6 in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Assuming that the nascent job market recovery builds some momentum, and that the equity market does not continue to head south, these indicators ought to remain on a generally improving path,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at an average annual pace of 6.1 percent in the final six months of 2003, and is forecast to expand 4.6 percent this year, the most since 1984, according to a Bloomberg News poll of economists.  </p>

The survey results suggest that Japan's strong economic performance for the fourth quarter of 2003 is continuing into 2004, economists said.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence tumbled in February as persistent worries about jobs tarnished Americans' optimism, an industry group reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped more than 9 points, to 87.3, after a rise in January to a revised reading of 96.4. That reading was the index's highest since mid-2002. Analysts expected a decline, but the index came in significantly below their consensus forecast of 92.3.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumers began the year on a high note, but their optimism has quickly given way to caution,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. ''Consumers remain disheartened with current economic conditions, and at the core of their disenchantment is the labor market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The confidence reading is watched closely because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy. The decline in confidence is a sign that consumers are disturbed by changes in the job market, which have quickly become a crucial issue in the presidential campaign, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The labor market is actually improving, not very rapidly, but it's improving,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Company in Minneapolis. ''But the perception is otherwise.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in confidence reflects consumer uncertainty over both the current business climate and economic conditions in the next six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, an index measuring consumers' assessment of current conditions declined to 73.1, from 79.4 in January. Those describing the present climate as good declined to 19.3 percent, from 21.9 percent in January. Those who said conditions were bad increased to 25.1 percent, from 22.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sentiment on jobs was similarly depressed, with those saying positions are hard to get rising to 32.1 percent, from 31.6 percent, while those saying jobs are plentiful slipped to 11.8 percent, from 12.3 percent.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is kind of a stunner,'' said Chris Low, chief economist for FTN Financial in New York. ''A 10-point drop in the confidence index is significant and suggests there is a new pessimism among consumers that was not there a month ago.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, however, have cautioned against reading too much into the report, because it has no bearing on actual spending patterns of consumers.

The index compiled by the ZEW Center for European Economic Research found that investor confidence rose to 73.4 percent in November from 67.2 percent in October. The institute said a Europewide index showed a similar increase. Economists said the optimism was based on faster economic growth in Germany, helped by the recovery in the United States. Another German research institute, DIW, raised its forecast for economic growth in the fourth quarter to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent a day earlier. Petra Kappl (NYT)  </p>
