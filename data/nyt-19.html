<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In science, popular ideas are often discarded once new evidence comes along, then revived in the face of still newer evidence. In the Observatory column this week, Douglas Quenqua reports on the long-running debate over whether the early winged creature Archaeopteryx ought to be considered a bird or a dinosaur. Paleontologists have gone back and forth on the issue, but the discovery of a dinosaur even older than Archaeopteryx has now given comfort to the bird camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week also brought stories of literal revival -- involving Little Ice Age plants and perhaps Big Ice Age woolly mammoths -- photographs of chemical reactions, diminished radiation worries in Japan, and astronomy meeting social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chemistry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atoms, Rearranged</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have captured images of atoms in motion, rearranging themselves in chemical reactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a picture of an atom is a lot like reading Braille. The sharp tip of an atomic-force microscope rises and falls as it is dragged across the bumps on a surface -- the atoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of researchers has now modified the technique, positioning a carbon monoxide molecule so that a single oxygen atom acted as a ''finger'' that felt not only carbon atoms, but also the chemical bonds between the atoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That allowed them to observe how a carbon-based molecule rearranged itself into other molecules when temperatures exceeded 194 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space Exploration</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel, Irradiated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first humans who travel to Mars, the trade-off of fame and history will be a higher risk of dying from cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's latest robotic spacecraft on the planet, the Curiosity rover, measured the radiation it encountered during its interplanetary trip. As expected, the radiation, mostly from cosmic rays from outside the galaxy, was several hundred times as intense as what reaches the surface of the Earth, scientists announced last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For astronauts making a round trip to Mars -- six months each way using current rocket propulsion -- that would correspond to a three-percentage-point increase in the lifetime risk of a fatal cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mars lacks a magnetic field or a thick atmosphere, astronauts would absorb additional radiation during their time on Mars' surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archaeology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Gift From the Sky</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iron beads from 3300 B.C. found in Egypt turn out to have an older, more distant origin. They were made from a meteorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excavated from a cemetery south of Cairo, the nine tube-shaped beads had a large amount of nickel, like iron meteorites, leading to speculation that they had been shaped out of extraterrestrial metal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study confirms the high nickel content, along with a crystal structure found only in iron meteorites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods,'' said Joyce Tyldesley, an archaeologist at the <span class="companylink">University of Manchester</span> in England and an author of the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Life From Old</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With warming temperatures, a glacier on Ellesmere Island in northern Canada has been receding, exposing plants that had been trapped under ice since the Little Ice Age more than 400 years ago. But scientists noticed that some of the seemingly black, dead plants had small green growths. In the laboratory, they ground up some of the plant samples and sprinkled them over soil in petri dishes. Within months, resurrected plants sprouted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Siberia, Russian scientists reported that they had extracted blood from the carcass of a woolly mammoth that had been frozen for 10,000 years, leading to speculation that the DNA might be preserved well enough to enable cloning of the extinct animal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power From the Gulf (of Maine)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first floating windmill in the United States went online Friday. Anchored in the Gulf of Maine, it will be able to capture the onshore breezes every sunny summer afternoon when the sun heats the land more than the ocean. Onshore wind machines generate most of their electricity at night, when it is of least use to utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prototype can generate only 20 kilowatts of electricity, but the University of Maine researchers who developed it hope it will lead to a 6-megawatt version with blades as long as the wingspan of a 747.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It Could Have Been Worse</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Badly damaged by an earthquake and an ensuing tsunami in March 2011, the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan teetered on the brink of a major disaster. A new report, however, suggests that the effects were much less dire than had been feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, published Thursday, experts on a United Nations committee say that people living around the plant received a radiation dose from the accident lower than what they get from natural background sources. There have also been no radiation-related deaths or acute effects observed among the 25,000 workers who were involved with the accident site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming Up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your Portrait Here (Look Up!)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $25, that could be you floating in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or more precisely, a picture of a picture of you floating in space. But for most of us, that is as close as we will ever get to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what you get in exchange for a $25 contribution to a $1 million fund-raising effort to build a private space telescope. As of Monday, the project was already most of the way there, with more than $700,000 raised, including 18 pledges of $10,000 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A video monitor will be mounted on the orbiting telescope to display photographs of its backers. A camera will take pictures of the photos on the monitor with the Earth in the background, and beam the images back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary Resources, the company building the telescope, plans to eventually mine asteroids, and it has deep-pocketed investors like Larry Page of <span class="companylink">Google</span> who could easily kick in $1 million themselves, but company officials said they wanted to give everyone a chance to take part in space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus they put their plans for their Arkyd-100 space telescope on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drive ends June 30. At higher pledge levels, you could buy telescope time for a school classroom or point it yourself for your personal astronomical observations.</p>
<p>RESILIENT: Scientists were  able to grow a moss, top, from  400-year-old remnants  exposed as a glacier recedes  in Canada. Arkyd-100, center,  will be a crowd-financed space  telescope. Contaminated  materials, bottom, from the  Fukushima nuclear plant in  Japan. A new report said the  health effects of the disaster  were less than feared.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In science, popular ideas are often discarded once new evidence comes along, then revived in the face of still newer evidence. In the Observatory column this week, Douglas Quenqua reports[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/science/new-fossil-reveals-oldest-known-avian-creature.html] on the long-running debate over whether the early winged creature Archaeopteryx ought to be considered a bird or a dinosaur. Paleontologists have gone back and forth on the issue, but the discovery of a dinosaur even older than Archaeopteryx has now given comfort to the bird camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week also brought stories of literal revival — involving Little Ice Age plants and perhaps Big Ice Age woolly mammoths — photographs of chemical reactions, diminished radiation worries in Japan, and astronomy meeting social media.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a picture of an atom is a lot like reading Braille. The sharp tip of an atomic-force microscope rises and falls as it is dragged across the bumps on a surface — the atoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of researchers has now modified the technique, positioning a carbon monoxide molecule so that a single oxygen atom acted as a “finger” that felt not only carbon atoms, but also the chemical bonds between the atoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That allowed them to observe how a carbon-based molecule rearranged itself[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2872/content/early/2013/05/29/science.1238187.abstract] into other molecules when temperatures exceeded 194 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For astronauts making a round trip to Mars — six months each way using current rocket propulsion — that would correspond to a three-percentage-point increase in the lifetime risk of a fatal cancer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of what appears to be a clay-rich rock on Mars adds to the portrait of the planet as one that once -- in its youth, more than three and a half billion years ago -- was a water-rich world with conditions amenable for life, NASA scientists said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock in question, about the size of a person's forearm, was examined by the Mars rover Opportunity, the older of the spacecraft still in operation on the planet. The newer rover, the Curosity, landed last August and has been hogging the headlines ever since; in a news conference on Friday, NASA officials proudly called attention to the fact that the Opportunity, launched nearly a decade ago, was still soldiering on with valuable field work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly discovered rock, which scientists named Esperance, is one of the oldest rocks that the Opportunity has looked at during its nine and a half years on Mars. From the abundances of elements like aluminum, calcium and magnesium, the mission's scientists concluded that the rock is very rich in clay minerals, which could have formed from copious water running over volcanic rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is powerful evidence that water interacted with this rock and changed its chemistry, changed its mineralogy in a dramatic way,'' said Steven W. Squyres, the principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity and a twin rover, the Spirit, landed on Mars in January 2004, intended for a three-month mission. The Spirit got stuck in 2009 and has not been heard from since 2010, but the Opportunity remains in ''remarkably good health,'' said John Callas, the project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is now Sol 3,331 in our 90-day rover mission,'' Dr. Callas said. A sol is a Martian day, which is 39 minutes longer than a day on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity has already found many signs of flowing water in Mars's ancient past, but of very acidic water. ''In fact, what Opportunity has mostly discovered evidence for in the past was sulfuric acid on Mars,'' Dr. Squyres said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clays in Esperance -- which means ''hope,'' but the rock was actually named after a gold mine in French Guiana where a project member had done research -- formed in more neutral waters. ''This is water you could drink,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''This is water that was probably much more favorable in its chemistry, in its pH, in its level of acidity, for things like prebiotic chemistry, the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, Dr. Squyres talked about a light-colored fine-grained rock in the same area, which appeared to possess a thin crust of clays, but otherwise had a composition typical of most Martian rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Esperance contains a much higher concentration of clays, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its limited instruments, the Opportunity cannot look for carbon-based molecules that could be the building blocks of life. The Curiosity, which landed on another part of Mars, is larger and has a more advanced chemistry laboratory, and Dr. Squyres was asked if he wished that the Opportunity had the same capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Absolutely,'' he said with a chuckle. ''No question about it. This is a treasure trove.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunity is now headed for a 180-foot hill called Solander Point, less than a mile away. The slope will allow the rover to tilt its fixed solar panels northward to the Sun as winter approaches. Outcrops at Solander Point could reveal more clay-rich rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, elsewhere on Mars, the Curiosity is about to wrap up its work on a couple of intriguing rocks that have painted a similar story of the planet's early history. It will then head toward its primary goal, an 18,000-foot mountain where rocks near the base are believed to contain clay minerals. That five-mile trip is expected to take about a year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRILLIANT BLUNDERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Darwin to Einstein -- Colossal Mistakes by Great Scientists That Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mario Livio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">341 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to a fellow physicist in 1915, Albert Einstein described how a scientist gets things wrong:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''1. The devil leads him by the nose with a false hypothesis. (For this he deserves our pity.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''2. His arguments are erroneous and sloppy. (For this he deserves a beating.)''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his own rules, Einstein should have been pitied and beaten alike. ''Einstein himself certainly committed errors of both types,'' the astrophysicist Mario Livio writes in his enlightening new book, ''Brilliant Blunders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of what we read about science is some version of a success story: Scientists just discovered the oldest human fossil; how did they do it? Success is certainly part of the story, but this version of Whig history blinds us to how people actually do science. Science is a mess. It's shaped by the time and place in which scientists work. Scientists choose to do a certain experiment or interpret an observation for many reasons. ''More than 20 percent of Einstein's original papers contain mistakes of some sort,'' Livio writes. ''In several cases, even though he made mistakes along the way, the final result is still correct. This is often the hallmark of great theorists: They are guided by intuition more than by formalism.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, however, being a great scientist means being above error. That's why it is so common to see a magazine cover headline declaring, in screaming type, Einstein was wrong, or its weasel-word variant, was Einstein wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livio's book is a valuable antidote to this skewed picture. He profiles five great scientists -- Einstein, Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Linus Pauling and Fred Hoyle -- each of whom made major discoveries and major mistakes. All five put their chips down on the wrong number, even as others prevailed. Thanks to his deep curiosity, Livio turns ''Brilliant Blunders'' into a thoughtful meditation on the course of science itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Charles Darwin presented his theory of evolution in 1859, he built a foundation for all of modern biology. Crucial to his theory was the fact that animals and plants inherited traits from their ancestors. Natural selection favored some traits over others, giving rise to long-term change. But Darwin didn't know how heredity worked. He devoted a lot of time to developing ideas that, in hindsight, seem daft. ''Darwin had been educated according to the then widely held belief that the characteristics of the two parents become physically blended in their offspring,'' Livio writes, ''as in the mixing of paints.'' By this logic, each ancestor's genetic contribution would be halved in each generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This idea wasn't just wrong. It undermined Darwin's own theory of evolution. If our traits are just a result of blended particles, it shouldn't be possible for natural selection to change traits over the generations. But try as he might, Darwin couldn't figure out a better explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet right around the time that Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species,'' the Czech monk Gregor Mendel was discovering genetics. Crossing pea plants in his garden, he got a glimpse at how heredity actually does work. Darwin apparently never became aware of Mendel's work, nor did he discover Mendel's results for himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today biologists can track evolution at the molecular level because they know what genes are made of. In the early 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked out the double-helix structure of DNA. They worked quickly, because they knew that the Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Linus Pauling was trying to solve the puzzle as well. Pauling came very close, but stumbled just as Watson and Crick were making their breakthrough. He got stuck on the idea that DNA forms three intertwined spirals, rather than two, and worse, he made an elementary error in the chemistry -- his nucleic acid molecule was actually not an acid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after Crick and Watson published their discoveries in 1953, Pauling paid them a visit at Cambridge and examined their model of DNA. He acknowledged that they were right and he was wrong, and soon afterward he made the same declaration in public. That kind of graciousness is not universal among Livio's blunderers, though. The great physicist Lord Kelvin held firm, until his death in 1907, to his conviction that the Earth was only millions of years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin believed that life had been designed, and he investigated the age of the Earth in part to rebut Darwin's theory of natural selection. If Darwin's theories were right, then the Earth must be very old, but geologists had no way to precisely measure the planet's age. Kelvin had the brilliant insight that the temperature of rocks might hold the answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth, Kelvin rightly reasoned, had started out as a ball of molten rock. It took a straightforward mathematical exercise to calculate how long it had taken for the Earth to cool to its current temperature. And when Kelvin did the math, he concluded that the Earth was fairly young, roughly 100 million years (we now know it to be about 4.567 billion years old). He carried out similar calculations to work out the comparable age of the Sun. If the Sun had indeed formed billions of years ago, Kelvin believed it would have burned out long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin was wrong for two reasons. As a former student of his pointed out, Kelvin assumed that the Earth's interior was fixed and transports heat at the same rate everywhere. In fact, it roils like boiling water, transporting heat to the surface. The other reason for Kelvin's error was quantum physics. Radioactivity helps keep the Earth warm, and nuclear fusion has allowed the Sun to burn for 4.567 billion years. Kelvin's critics brought both these counterarguments to his attention, but he seems to have viewed them with contemptuous indifference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuclear fusion doesn't just power stars, it also creates new elements like carbon and iron. The British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle made this tremendous discovery in the 1940s and '50s. Unfortunately, Hoyle might be better known for promoting a flawed theory about the origin of the universe: He was convinced that the universe was in a continual state of creation. As evidence for the Big Bang mounted, he became an increasingly embarrassing crank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livio chooses Einstein as the fifth member of his blundering quintet. Einstein was puzzled as to why the universe didn't cave in on itself. Empty space, he suggested, contained a mysterious energy pushing outward, resisting the universe's inward collapse. After he published this idea -- what came to be known as the cosmological constant -- he regretted it. He said it didn't emerge naturally from his equations; he'd tacked it on like a cheap piece of plywood over a hole in a roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein eventually denounced the cosmological constant. And that, it turns out, was his big mistake. In the 1990s, physicists discovered dark energy, something very similar to that mythical force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livio brings the care of a historian to his nimble narratives, avoiding heroic clichés. He's less adept at explaining why these great scientists made their mistakes, too often trotting out pop psychology to demonstrate why people stubbornly cling to ideas even when they see evidence to the contrary. The psychology of bad science is a fascinating topic, but it requires a broader look at how the entire scientific community operates. Five scientists -- no matter how great -- cannot shoulder that load.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic hearts started beating a little faster last fall when a team of European astronomers announced that they had found a planet with a mass comparable to Earth's orbiting Alpha Centauri B, part of a triple star that is the Sun's nearest neighbor, only 4.4 light years from here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Geoffrey W. Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said at the time, ''This is close enough you can almost spit there.'' Close enough, some astronomers said, to send a scientific probe that would get there in our lifetime. The new planet, only four million miles from its home star, would be too hellishly hot for life, but, astronomers said, where there is one planet there are likely to be others, more comfortably situated for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, in a shot across the bow of cosmological optimism, a new analysis of the European data has cast doubt on whether there is actually a ''there'' there at Alpha Centauri B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in The Astrophysical Journal last month, Artie P. Hatzes, the director of the Thuringian State Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany, who was not part of the original discovery team, reported that he could not confirm the planet when he went looking for it in the European data on his own. ''Sometimes it is there, other times not,'' depending on the method he used to reduce the statistical noise, he said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean the planet does not exist, Dr. Hatzes wrote, but ''in my years of experience in extracting planet signals, this simply does not 'smell' like a real planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hatzes's skepticism proved catching. Suzanne Aigrain of <span class="companylink">Oxford University</span> quoted Carl Sagan's dictum that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, saying that Dr. Hatzes's paper ''certainly casts doubt on the original evidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xavier Dumusque of the University of Geneva, who led the original discovery effort, said that Dr. Hatzes's challenge was healthy for science. ''Calling to question a detection is always something fruitful,'' Dr. Dumusque wrote in an e-mail. But he added that it was clear in his team's paper that ''the signal we are searching for is at the limit of the data precision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More data, everyone agrees, is essential, and luckily there will be more data, according to Debra Fischer, a Yale astronomer who has studied the Alpha Centauri system. Both her group and the Geneva team of which Dr. Dumusque is a member obtained more observations in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May was a bad time for exoplanet astronomers. NASA's planet-hunting Kepler satellite lost its pointing capability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quoting Jeff Lebowski, the hero of the Coen brothers movie ''The Big Lebowski,'' Dr. Hatzes said, ''Life is indeed 'gutters and strikes,' and this week were some gutters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alpha Centauri B planet is hardly the first promising world to slip into the shadows of uncertainty. Astronomers are still arguing about the existence of Gliese 581g, a ''Goldilocks'' planet said to be almost a sure bet for life when it was discovered in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all goes to show just how devilish the details have become as astronomers close in on the goal of finding Earth-like planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dumusque and his colleagues first found the planet by the so-called wobble method -- perfected over the years by Michel Mayor and his colleagues at the Geneva Observatory -- which measures planets' masses by how much they tug their host star to and fro as they orbit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group uses a specially built spectrograph called Harps on a 140-inch-diameter telescope at the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span> in La Silla, Chile, to measure those wobbles, which show up as slight rhythmic shifts in the wavelength of starlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth imparts a kick of about four inches a second to the Sun as it orbits around, but that is much smaller than the jitter caused by sunspots and magnetic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that success in detecting low-mass planets depends more and more on digging a small signal out of a much larger background of noise in a reliable manner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, which uses the blink method to find planets when they cross in front of their stars, is running up against limits of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the grounds that three blinks were needed to verify an orbit, Kepler's astronomers once thought they would need three years to verify the existence of planets in comfortable orbits like our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stars turned out to be noisier than predicted; a year ago, Kepler's mission was extended so that more blinks could be collected, but the failure of a reaction wheel that allows the telescope to point precisely has probably brought an end to that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still an enormous amount of data in Kepler's pipeline, including 132 confirmed planets and, as of last week, 3,216 planet candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting in the wings for a 2017 launching is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS, which will monitor about two million nearby stars for exoplanets. ''In fact,'' the project's leader, George R. Ricker of the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, said during a talk at <span class="companylink">Google</span> a few years ago, ''when starships transporting colonists first depart the solar system, they may well be headed toward a TESS-discovered planet as their new home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might even be in Alpha Centauri.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A jewelry store is an archive of the Earth. Every gem fixed to every ring or necklace was forged deep inside our planet, according to its own recipe of elements, temperature and pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has taken a while for geologists to decode the cookbook for gems. Jade, for example, puzzled geologists for decades. “For a long time people looked at this crazy rock, and it didn’t make any sense,” said George Harlow, a geologist at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>. But thanks to the research of Dr. Harlow and other geologists, jade now has a back story: It formed in dying oceans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of gems like rubies and jade thus signifies more than just a new supply of bling in jewelry stores. It tells geologists some important things about the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rocks contain jade, the scientists can be fairly sure those rocks are a vestige of an ocean buried underground. Rubies, on the other hand, appear in places where mountains formed from continental collisions, even if those mountains were eroded away millions of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gems may thus preserve precious clues to some of the most profound questions about the life of our planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth is covered with tectonic plates. In some places, like off the coast of the northwestern United States, ocean plates are getting pushed underneath continental ones. As the plates sink, they are squeezed to titanic pressures. They also get cooked. Under these extreme conditions, their atoms are combined into new molecular arrangements that would never emerge anywhere else on Earth. Hot jets of mineral-rich fluid rise from the plates, pushing up into the overlying rock. Among the things that emerge from that fluid is a mixture of sodium, aluminum, silicon and oxygen known as jadeite — a form of jade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current issue of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Dr. Harlow and his colleagues report[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2052/science/article/pii/S0012821X13001970] new findings that support this chain of events. At the bottom of the Caribbean Sea, they found jade-bearing deposits that are 30 million years older than the surrounding rock. That’s what you would expect if jade-producing fluid rose up from sinking oceanic crust long before other material from a sinking ocean plate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the journal Geology[http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2013/05/09/G34204.1], Dr. Harlow — writing with Robert J. Stern of the <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Dallas</span>, Tatsuki Tsujimori of <span class="companylink">Okayama University</span> in Japan and Lee A. Groat of the <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span> — explores some stories that gems like jade can tell. Each is different. While jade is produced from dying oceans, for example, rubies are forged in newborn mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some mountain ranges, like the Himalayas, were formed when two continental plates collided. Fifty million years ago[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2052/science/article/pii/S1342937X11001225], the Indian subcontinent was an isolated island. In a slow-motion crash, it plowed into Asia. The force of the impact crumpled rocks for hundreds of miles inland, producing mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As mountains rose overhead, the Indian plate slid underneath Asia. Once again, the rock was squeezed and heated. Continents are ringed by rocks like shale, formed from sediments washing off of land. When crushed in this subterranean forge, shale can produce crystals of aluminum and oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If these crystals stop developing, they become sapphires. But the crystals may instead get pushed up toward the surface of the Earth. The overlying rock they move into is rich in chromium. The chromium atoms push the aluminum atoms out of the crystals and take their place, giving them a red color. “When they get a little chromium in them, we call them rubies,” Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oldest deposits of jade and rubies date to only about 600 million years ago. The Earth itself is more than 4.5 billion years old, which naturally raises the question of why there aren’t any jade stones or rubies from the first nearly four billion years of the planet’s existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stern, for one, thinks the answer is that plate tectonics — the stirring of the planet’s interior that drives plates around its surface — didn’t exist for most of Earth’s history. “I would say it started less than a billion years ago,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s a controversial idea in the geological community. Perhaps gems may someday resolve it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 14, 2013, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article described jadeite incorrectly. It is a form of jade, but not the most common. (Nephrite is the most common form.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I view the Moon, there are times when I feel like I’m on a time machine. I am back to a cherished point in the past — now nearly 45 years ago — when Neil Armstrong and I stood on that bleak, but magnificent lunar landscape called the Sea of Tranquility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we were farther away from Earth than humans had ever been, the fact is that we weren’t alone. An estimated 600 million people back on Earth, at that time the largest television audience in history, watched us plant our footprints on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to today. Now I see the Moon in a far different light — not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is time to lay the groundwork for effective global human exploration of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA’s Apollo program adopted a get-there-in-a-hurry, straightforward space race strategy that left the former Soviet Union in the lunar dust. Doing so meant don’t waste time developing reusability. Let’s close that chapter in the space exploration history books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am calling for a unified international effort to explore and utilize the Moon, a partnership that involves commercial enterprise and other nations building upon Apollo. Let me emphasize: A second ‘‘race to the Moon’’ is a dead end. America should chart a course of being the leader of this international activity to develop the Moon. The United States can help other nations do things that they want to do, a fruitful avenue for U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A step in the right direction is creating an International Lunar Development Corporation, customized to draw upon the legacy of lessons learned from such endeavors as the International Geophysical Year (whose purpose was to get scientists all over the world to focus on the physics and atmosphere of the Earth), the International Space Station program, as well as model organizations such as Intelsat and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>. Space collaboration should be the new norm, including the tapping of talented Chinese, Indian and other space experts from around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my view, U.S. resources are better spent on moving toward establishing a human presence on Mars. I envision a comprehensive plan that would lead to permanent human settlement on Mars in the next 25 years. To get under way, the International Space Station can serve as a test bed for long-duration life support and for technologies that can safely, reliably and routinely transport crews to the distant shores of Mars. I’ve championed the creation of spacecraft to be placed on continuous loops between Mars and Earth, thereby putting in place a pathway to sustainability that forever links the two planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going to Mars means staying on Mars — a mission by which we are building up a confidence level to become a two-planet species. At Mars, we’ve been given a wonderful set of moons — one of which, perhaps Phobos, can act as an offshore world from which crews can robotically preposition hardware and establish radiation shielding on the Martian surface to begin sustaining increasing numbers of people. To succeed at Mars, you cannot stop with a one-shot foray to the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My passion for space exploration is guided by two principles: a continuously expanding human presence in space, and retention of U.S. leadership in space. To move forward, what’s required is what I term as a Unified Space Vision for America that is predicated on exploration, science, development, commerce and security. To reach beyond low Earth orbit requires a suite of missions that are the foundation for such a Unified Space Vision. Putting in place and staying on track with this unified approach must begin now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I call for an international effort to further explore and utilize the Moon. It would be a partnership that involves commercial enterprise and other nations building upon the Apollo legacy. But the real calling is Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By implementing a step-by-step vision — just as the United States did with the single-seat Mercury capsule, followed by the two-person Gemini spacecraft that made Apollo possible — humankind can push outward to the distant dunes of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Earth isn’t the only world for us anymore. It’s time to seek out new frontiers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shantel Collins and Yahaira Monzon were chatting before the start of class when their conversation was interrupted by the sound of a bell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ladies, ladies,'' said Starr Ravenhawk, one of their instructors, ''the deities demand your respect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Collins and Ms. Monzon, both dressed in black hooded robes with silver five-pointed stars dangling from their necks, grew quiet and settled into their seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's begin,'' said Arlene Fried, another instructor, who sat behind a folding table that had been transformed into an altar, complete with candles, a chalice, a black-handled knife and a tiny caldron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Which of you can tell me what that star around your neck is called?'' Ms. Fried said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A pentacle,'' Ms. Collins replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And what is it for?'' Ms. Fried asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives us protection against anything negative or evil; it's kind of like a cross for Christians,'' Ms. Monzon said, staring into her notebook as she spoke. ''The top of the star represents the spirit. Each of the other points represent an element: earth, air, fire and water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Collins, 24, and Ms. Monzon, 34, are students at the Wiccan Family Temple Academy of Pagan Studies in Manhattan, where they are studying to become witches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know that sounds shocking to most people because witchcraft is usually thought of as evil,'' said Ms. Ravenhawk, a high priestess of the Wiccan Family Temple. ''But if people really knew what we are about, they would know that studying to become a good witch is no different than studying to become a good Catholic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen men and women are currently studying witchcraft in the mystical shadow of Ms. Ravenhawk, who helped found the school in 2007. They are enrolled in a three-year program that includes courses like ''Introduction to Wicca,'' a modern pagan, witchcraft religion that worships the divinity in nature. Other courses include ''History of Witchcraft,'' ''Introduction to Magic,'' ''Spells and How They Work'' and ''Esbats: Celebrating the Phases of the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year of introductory courses, second-year students like Ms. Collins and Ms. Monzon strive to become full-fledged witches. Third-year students aspire to become high priests or high priestesses. Each school year is made up of 24 two-hour classes, with students paying $25 per class. That amounts to 144 hours of total class work and $1,800 in tuition for any student who pursues the entire three-year curriculum, which is not accredited outside the realm of Ms. Ravenhawk's teachings and beliefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of that matters to Ms. Collins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People go to school to study the things that interest them most; some people go to law school, others to medical school,'' she said. ''I want to be a religious leader in my community, so the path I chose is to become a high priestess. I am learning how to counsel people in my community. No one is born a pastor or a reverend or a rabbi -- you have to work at it, and that's what I'm doing. So for me, these classes are worth every minute and every penny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Ms. Ravenhawk said her students ''are people with normal lives and normal jobs,'' she added that ''not all of them are willing to identify themselves and talk about it for fear of what other people might think, especially in the workplace. They are not yet ready to come out of the broom closet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Collins, a Bronx resident and former youth counselor in Manhattan, said she first became interested in the Wiccan faith when she was 13 and learned about it from a family friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was raised Baptist, but what drew me to this religion was its respect for the earth and the way it puts me in touch with nature,'' she said. ''I feel a lot more liberated in this religion; it is more respectful to me as a person and as a woman. It's basically, 'Live as you choose as long as you don't harm anyone.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Collins admitted that, like many of her classmates, she has kept her newfound religion mostly a secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My mother knows that I am a Wiccan witch, but most of my family does not,'' she said. ''People like my grandmother who are not as open-minded and do not believe in diversity, they just wouldn't understand, but this is not an evil religion. We do not worship the devil -- we do not even believe in the devil. This is about connecting with the natural forces to advance yourself spiritually.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Monzon was attempting to do just that when she approached the altar and picked up the knife, which is called an athame and is used to direct energy. ''Great mother and great father,'' she said, ''I will only use this ceremonial knife in your presence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Monzon then cut open an imaginary doorway and stepped through it, an act of leaving behind her world for a more spiritual realm. Ms. Collins and the two instructors did the same, and soon all four had formed a circle and were praying to both a male and a female god.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like people who are a part of any other religion, all we are trying to do is become better people,'' Ms. Ravenhawk said. ''And like most other religions, we accept the fact that there is a higher being.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Ravenhawk also insisted that Wiccan witches like herself do not believe in Satan, she did note that the pentacle she wears around her neck ''is said to repel vampires.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not those vampires who will drain your blood,'' she said, ''but those who will drain your energy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMES, Iowa -- As the car pulled into the parking lot of a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, William Sanford Nye unknotted his trademark bow tie and slipped it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This might buy us a couple of minutes,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly two minutes later, before his drink was ready, he was recognized anyway. Two awed young women approached to ask if he was really Bill Nye the Science Guy. Like more than a dozen other college students who would approach him over the next several hours, they asked if they could take a picture with him. He smiled, took a proffered iPhone, scooched the students in and, in a practiced gesture, stretched out his arm to take a shot of the three of them that you just knew was totally going on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye had come to talk to them, and a few thousand of their friends, at <span class="companylink">Iowa State University</span>. If he were a politician, college students would be his base. Instead, he is something more: a figure from their early days in front of the family TV, a beloved teacher and, more and more these days, a warrior for science. They, in turn, are his fans, his students and his army.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have gone from watching him explain magnetism and electricity to defending the scientific evidence for climate change, the age of the earth and other issues they have seen polemicized for religious, political and even economic reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He takes on those who would demand that the public schools teach alternative theories of evolution and the origins of the earth -- most famously, in a video clip from the site BigThink.com that has been viewed some five million times. In it, he flatly tells adult viewers that ''if you want to deny evolution and live in your world -- in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe -- that's fine. But don't make your kids do it, because we need them. We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any given week, you're likely to see Mr. Nye, 57, somewhere on television, calmly countering the arguments made by people like Marc Morano, the former Republican Senate staff member whose industry-funded organization, climatedepot.com, disputes the increasingly well-understood connection between rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and warming. In an exchange several months ago on ''Piers Morgan Tonight'' on CNN, Mr. Morano denied that warming is occurring, and scoffed that Mr. Nye's arguments were ''the level of your daily horoscope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye quietly rebutted his opponent with the gravity of scientific consensus. ''This will be the hottest two decades in recorded history,'' he said. ''I've got to disagree with you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes his advocacy can step out in front of scientific consensus, however. In May, after a monster tornado devastated large parts of Moore, Okla., he took a jab on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> at one of that state's United States senators, James Inhofe, who has written a book calling climate change ''the greatest hoax.'' He mused: ''Has anyone asked Oklahoma Senator Inhofe'' about the frequency of such destructive storms? Yet a link between climate change and tornado activity has not been established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the night the tornado hit Moore, Mr. Nye explained to Mr. Morgan that ''you can't say from any one storm that 'this is a result of, let's say, climate change.' '' But he noted that ''if there's more heat driving the storm, then there's going to be more tornadoes,'' and added that the question ''is worth investigating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, said that he considered Mr. Nye ''among my best friends'' and complimented him for ''hitting controversial topics head on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said, his own style is a bit less confrontational: ''I'm looking to stimulate curiosity so most people can go out there and learn on their own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Plait, the creator of the Bad Astronomy blog at Slate.com and a fierce advocate himself, is more like Mr. Nye, willing to take the gloves off in rebutting those who might deny that men landed on the moon, or the evidence for human effects on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Plait said admiringly of Mr. Nye, ''He will very calmly tear them apart,'' adding, ''His big advantage is, he's right. We know that climate change is real. We know creationism is wrong. These are no longer scientific controversies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people call these 'controversial topics,' that's misleading,'' he continued. ''They are only controversial politically. And politics is not necessarily evidence-based.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was nothing in Mr. Nye's early days that suggested he might be a firebrand for science. Born in Washington, D.C., he studied mechanical engineering at Cornell, where he got to know a professor named Carl Sagan. He moved out West to do engineering for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, where he spent some three years designing a hydraulic tube for the 747 that served to dampen vibration in the steering mechanism. He refers to it lovingly as ''my tube.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He tried his hand at stand-up comedy -- his first time onstage was during a Steve Martin look-alike competition, which he won. He would achieve escape velocity from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> with an idea for a television program that would teach science to children in a wacky way. The best-known version of ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' ran from 1992 to 1996, and won 18 Emmys in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye's past teaching and present crusading have made him a rock star for scientifically inclined students across the country. That celebrity has allowed him, as executive director of the Planetary Society, to push for the kind of interplanetary exploration that, he said in an interview, ''leads to the reverence that we have for our place in the cosmos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Space,'' he added, ''brings out the best in us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of Mr. Nye's visit to the Iowa State campus, students began lining up by midafternoon to make sure they got into the evening lecture. Stephens Auditorium holds about 3,000 people, and as many as a thousand would ultimately be turned away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They came, many said, because ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' helped shape their lives. ''He was probably the one who inspired me to keep going in the science career track,'' said Betsy Salmon, the first person in line at one entrance to the auditorium. She majored in animal ecology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaci McCleary, an ''aspiring neurobiologist, or neuro-something,'' said that Mr. Nye was ''a very inspiring person in the field of science -- he tells people to make science part of their lives, even if it's not their career.'' Ms. McCleary, who knitted as she waited to be let in, said a friend had joked to her, ''I hope to be able to touch the hem of his lab coat, so he could cure me of my stupid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye did not disappoint. In a lecture that gave evidence of his stand-up roots, he started out with rambling asides on his his family and its generations-long fascination with sundials. He talked about the bluish tinge of shadows on Earth compared with the orangy shadows on Mars, and described the sundial that he convinced NASA to send up with the Curiosity rover. He got a little risqué with a joke about the gnomon -- the part of the sundial that sticks up, you know -- and bounced into a discussion of the hellish heat of Venus and that planet's high concentration of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He told the students that if they figured out ways to solve problems like greenhouse gases and global warming, ''You could -- dare I say it? -- change the world!'' And what's more, he added, throwing his head back for a hearty mad-scientist laugh, ''you could get rich!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the hour-and-a-half talk, those statements started out as a laugh line that got funnier through increasingly manic repetition. But he shifted his tone gradually, from goofy to fervent. By the end of his speech, it was an exhortation, a command: Change the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the question-and-answer session, a student brought up Mr. Nye's comments on evolution and creation. The problem, he explained, is that some people advocate requiring public schools to teach religious apologia as science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The earth's not 4,000, 6,000, 10,000 years old,'' he said. ''I've got no problem with anybody's religion. But if you go claiming the earth is only 10,000 years old, that's just wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The students roared their approval. As the audience streamed out -- did those dudes really rip off their shirts to show that they had painted, in all capital letters, ''Bill Nye'' on their chests and ''science'' on their backs? -- Mr. Nye looked like someone who had just run a triathlon. And then it was time for more pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, he had marveled at the chain of events that made him the Springsteen of the nerds. ''I was making a TV show. It had commercials for toys.'' Yet, he noted, ''It stands the test of time. It's very gratifying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he did then, and what he does now, are all part of the same crusade, he said. ''There's nothing I believe in more strongly than getting young people interested in science and engineering,'' he said -- ''for a better tomorrow, for all humankind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He stopped, realizing that sounded grandiose, or at least corny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not kidding,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dim, lightweight galaxy on the outskirts of the Milky Way may be the smallest in the known universe, astronomers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Segue 2, the dwarf galaxy consists of just 1,000 stars held together by a clump of dark matter. (By comparison, the Milky Way contains at least 100 billion stars.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Finding a galaxy this small is like finding an elephant smaller than a mouse,'' said James Bullock, a cosmologist at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of a paper on Segue 2 published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Segue 2, first discovered in 2009 as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, is important for reasons other than size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For about 15 years, we have been predicting that galaxies like the Milky Way should be surrounded by thousands and thousands of low-mass clumps of dark matter'' like the one at the center of Segue 2, Dr. Bullock said. Until now, even the smallest ''clumps'' detected by scientists were high mass -- at least a million times the mass of the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At no more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun, Segue 2 ''could be the first of these clumps detected that we've been predicting should be out there,'' Dr. Bullock said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, failure to find such clumps had puzzled astronomers. ''It suggested there was some flaw in our theory of how the universe works,'' said Dr. Bullock, who was part of a team that used the powerful telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this discovery, he said, there is hope that ''this might be just be the tip of the iceberg.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One flies a fighter jet for the Marines. Another is an assistant professor of anesthesiology at <span class="companylink">Harvard Medical School</span>. A third is a helicopter pilot for the Army. And the fourth leads the station in American Samoa of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the four women in NASA's latest class of astronaut trainees, which also includes four men. The eight recruits -- the first NASA has named in four years, and the first group to include equal numbers of men and women -- were selected from 6,300 applicants and will start training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston in August, the space agency said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well after a few years of training, one or more might be selected for a stint at the International Space Station, or -- eventually -- for a trip to an asteroid or Mars, places that NASA eventually hopes to visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just so surreal that this moment has arrived,'' said Anne C. McClain, 34, the helicopter pilot, who is from Spokane, Wash., and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point. ''I truly don't remember ever wanting to be something else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and the other recruits spoke in prerecorded video introductions that NASA shared as part of an online video conference. The agency did not make the trainees available for interviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said that the new class, the agency's 21st, was the smallest group to date, chosen after a year-and-a-half search from the largest applicant pool since 1978. Only 120 applicants were invited to come to the Johnson Space Center, where they underwent initial medical evaluations and an hour interview with the selection board. Forty-nine candidates were invited back for a second round of interviews as well as language aptitude tests, psychological evaluations and mechanical skills assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the eight who were finally selected, five come from branches of the military and many of them hold multiple advanced degrees in physics, engineering, biology and medicine. Those who make it through two years of intense training will join NASA's existing corps of 49 astronauts, down from a peak of 149 in 2000. And the newcomers may then have to wait up to 10 years before their first spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a smaller astronaut corps, fewer people in the office now, each person needs to have as diverse a background as possible,'' Janet Kavandi, director of flight crew operations at Johnson Space Center, said during the online video hosted on Google+ Hangout. ''So we tried to work hard to make sure that the eight people we got had a broad spectrum of experiences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new class also has the highest percentage of female candidates, which NASA said was not intentional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's actually just a reflection of how many really talented women are in science and engineering these days,'' said Kathleen Rubins, a NASA astronaut from the class of 2009, in a telephone interview. ''They're folks that have technical expertise in their chosen field, but they also bring a whole lot to the table'' in their determination and ability to thrive under pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of astronauts has dwindled along with the number of human space missions. NASA retired its space shuttle program two years ago, and has been booking space for American astronauts on Russian Soyuz capsules since then. But commercial spaceflight companies are now preparing to resume piloted American rocket launchings, ideally in 2017, according to the goal date by NASA, which has supported the private efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight new astronaut candidates will compete to be among ''the first to launch from U.S. soil on commercial American spacecraft since the retirement of the space shuttle,'' NASA said in its announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Ms. McClain, the women of the class of 2013 include Christina M. Hammock, 34, the NOAA station chief, of Jacksonville, N.C.; Nicole Aunapu Mann, 35, the fighter pilot and a Marine Corps major, of Penngrove, Calif.; and Jessica U. Meir, 35, of Caribou, Me., and <span class="companylink">Harvard Medical School</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four men are: Josh A. Cassada, 39, a physicist and former naval aviator from White Bear Lake, Minn.; Victor J. Glover, 37, a pilot and lieutenant commander in the Navy from Pomona, Calif., and Prosper, Tex.; Tyler N. Hague, 37, an Air Force lieutenant colonel, of Hoxie, Kan.; and Andrew R. Morgan, 37, a physician and an Army major, of New Castle, Pa.</p>
<p>The new class of trainees includes four women, from left, Christina M. Hammock, Nicole Aunapu Mann, Anne C. McClain and Jessica U. Meir, and four men, Josh A. Cassada, Victor J. Glover, Tyler N. Hague and Andrew R. Morgan.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan -- On a sultry desert evening, as bats fluttered about this town's riverfront park, a man emerged from a reedy marsh carrying a bundle of grass tied with twine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting it down to brush himself off, he explained that he was keeping a calf in the courtyard of an apartment building across town, where he had settled in recently after the previous occupants, engineers with the Russian space program, moved out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baikonur, in remote western Kazakhstan, was once the pride of the Soviet Union, the home of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the launching site of Sputnik, the dog Laika and the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin. But today, nomadic herders from the nearby steppe are moving into abandoned buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is just one of the signs of the city's long fade into the sunset of post-Soviet social and economic problems, which are all the more remarkable given that much of the world, including the United States, still relies on Baikonur for manned space launchings. The only other site for such liftoffs is in Jiuquan, in the Gobi Desert in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's painful for me to think of my town,'' Anna Khodakovskaya, the editor of the local newspaper, said of its glum state. The first cellphones appeared here in 2004; the first M.R.I. machine in 2011. ''We are not ahead of the planet in anything but space,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today 70 percent of Baikonur's residents are Kazakh citizens, but the town remains a Russian enclave rented from the Kazakh government and administered under Russian jurisdiction. At the time of the Soviet breakup, the ratios were reversed: it was only about one-third Kazakh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the squatting herders, day laborers and market traders stroll the streets, with only the occasional aging Russian engineer visible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a dusty town, where many sidewalks are sandy tracks but nearly every building is decorated with a mosaic of a rocket, a spacewalking cosmonaut or stars and fanciful renderings of planets. In fountains, water bubbles from spouts shaped like rockets, and signed portraits of astronauts adorn the walls of cafes, where coffee is served in the Turkish style with grounds in the cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a loose end from the breakup of the Soviet Union that has, strangely, become extraordinarily important for every manned space program except China's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA last month extended the contract for astronaut launchings for a year, until mid-2017, for an additional $424 million. For now, every American astronaut blasts off from this town, the stand-in for Cape Canaveral during a gap in funding for manned missions in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of this dependency, NASA now requires all its astronauts in training to achieve proficiency in Russian before graduating to the astronaut corps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agencies of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, Japan and Canada also launch from here on Russian rockets, under an agreement with NASA to repurchase about half of the six seats NASA buys annually from the Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From all this, Baikonur may sound like a prosperous hub of space activity. But the state of affairs is only temporary -- every nation including Russia, which is building a replacement launchpad on its own territory in the Far East, called Vostochny, views this state of affairs as temporary. As a result, the city of Baikonur has been ignored, and it is falling apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Russia will not be able to roll up the roads and take them away when it leaves,'' Ms. Khodakovskaya said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social problems typical of Central Asia today, like abuse of heroin smuggled from Afghanistan, labor migration and growing Islamic fundamentalism, are creeping into the city. A few years back, the police arrested men in Tura-Tam, a Kazakh village just outside Baikonur's guarded fence, for distributing leaflets for Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a fundamentalist Islamic group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is a low boil of ethnic tension, too, as Russians hold nearly all the high-paying space jobs. In 2011, young Kazakh men ran in a mass down a central street yelling, ''The head is a dog,'' a reference to the Russian mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the outdoor market, behind heaps of apricots and tomatoes, traders flash gold-toothed smiles and hawk Central Asian pottery glazed with crudely drawn rockets, or the smiling face of Yuri Gagarin in a helmet. Flies sampled the savory pies of mutton and pumpkin on display.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before space missions, NASA astronauts and administrators stay at an upscale hotel on the edge of town, where the cheapest room is about $340 a night, rarely venturing into the town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's interlude here is surreal, to be sure, though the United States has had gaps in its ability to reach space before: from the end of the Apollo program in 1975 until the first shuttle mission in 1981, and after both shuttle disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have always been treated with tremendous hospitality under difficult logistical circumstances,'' Rob Navias, a NASA spokesman, said in an interview here before the launching of an American astronaut, Karen L. Nyberg, last month. ''We are in a transition period right now, and we are hoping the transition is a short one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American astronauts ride a bus to the Russian rockets over a rutted, bumpy road where camels graze on the shoulders; nobody bothers to fill the potholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even President Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech on Cosmonaut Day on April 12, referred to Baikonur as ''physically aged.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people are putting up rockets, but the town itself is like a third-world country,'' said Jene Ragan, a software engineer from Bethesda, Md., who came as a tourist to watch a liftoff in May, swatting at flying ants out on the steppe while watching the rollout of a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alarmed at the state of Baikonur, the head of Kazakhstan's space agency, Talgat Musabayev, in December suggested canceling the rental agreement with Russia; Kazakhstan charges Russia $115 million a year for the town. ''The agreement has run its course,'' Mr. Musabayev said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kazakhs bristle at Russia's efforts to keep Kazakh squatters out of abandoned buildings, which are formally Kazakh property, noting the housing shortage in the region. They complain of debris falling on their territory from jettisoned rocket stages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, the Russians threatened to simply pull out entirely in 2018 when Vostochny is ready for manned launchings, Izvestia reported.</p>
<p>In Baikonur, Kazakhstan, clockwise from top left: Policemen guarding a rocket on its way to a launching pad; a multinational team  of astronauts ready for a mission; a playground that echoed the city's space theme; and men and boys cooling off in a park.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children of Medicis suffered from rickets, bones show</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rich are different from you and me, F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote. But according to a new study in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, children of the Medicis, one of history’s wealthiest families, may have suffered from rickets, a disease typically associated with the inferior diet and cramped living conditions of the poor. What’s more, the family’s wealth may have been to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italian researchers found evidence of the disease in the skeletons of nine 16th-century Medici children. Several of the skeletons had curved arm and leg bones — a telltale sign of walking or crawling on soft bones. One had a deformed skull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D, which renders bones soft or malformed. But an analysis of the nitrogen isotopes in the bone collagen, which indicates the main source of protein in one’s diet, suggests they were fed breast milk — a poor source of vitamin D — until they were 2 years old. They would have supplemented the breast milk only with soft bread and apples, which also do not contain much of the nutrient. The children were probably deprived of sunlight because suntans were discouraged as signs of low standing. DOUGLAS QUENQUA</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING — China’s three astronauts rose Thursday at 7 a.m. in their Tiangong-1 orbiter about 340 kilometers above earth, People’s Television, a channel of the Communist Party flagship People’s Daily group, reported. It was the day to teach science, in Chinese, from space[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgIvgR4P2Ng] – a first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years ago, the American teacher and astronaut Barbara R. Morgan became the first person to teach from space [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/science/space/15shuttle.html?ref=barbararaddingmorgan]aboard the International Space Station. Now it was China’s turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling her a “pretty space teacher,” People’s Television showed Wang Yaping, the female member of the three-person crew, holding up a sign that read: “Good morning lovable earth[http://tv.people.com.cn/GB/174133/364502/index.html]; Good morning beautiful fatherland; Good morning hard-working scientific researchers!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 10:11 a.m. it was time to teach[http://edu.ifeng.com/gundong/detail_2013_06/21/26634670_0.shtml], the Chengdu Evening News wrote. Class was beamed interactively to a large group of over 300 elementary and high school students gathered in a room at the People’s University Affiliated High School (the university is closely associated with the Communist Party, which founded it); and broadcast live to millions of students around the country, according to media reports. (Xinhua, the state-run news agency, said it was watched by 60 million students.) Class lasted 40 minutes, about twice as long as the class given by Ms. Morgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as six years ago, when 11-year-old Zakkary Schirmeister from McCall, Idaho (Ms. Morgan’s home state) asked what stars looked like from space, a Chinese child asked Ms. Wang if the stars twinkled from where she was. And like Ms. Morgan, Ms. Wang said no, outside the earth’s atmosphere they don’t twinkle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another question: Could she see any U.F.O.’s? Again, no. But they could see 16 sunrises and sunsets each day, she said, since they orbited the earth so often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiments were simple, including lessons in gravity, on how pendulums and gyroscopes move in space, and how water behaves. Her colleague, Nie Haisheng, struck a floating, cross-legged pose, a meditation and martial arts feat hardly possible on earth but easy in the weightless conditions of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Daily reported the venture was very well-received.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I learned about those laws of physics and weightless condition at classes before, I needed to imagine what would happen. But, at today’s class, I am able to see what really happens. It is thrilling[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013shenzhoux/2013-06/20/content_16638698.htm],” said Luo Jiangyuan, a high school student. He said he planned to study science in college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Class ended at 10:51, China Daily reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly afterward, Ms. Wang sent an e-mail to Ms. Morgan, the Chinese news media said. Ms. Morgan had already e-mailed to congratulate the Chinese astronaut, edu.ifeng.com reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My colleagues and I were very happy to receive your mail in distant space,” Ms. Wang wrote.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Secretary of State John Kerry’s G.M.O.-boosting speech[http://www.worldfoodprize.org/index.cfm/24667/24416/secretary_of_state_john_kerrys_remarks_from_the_world_food_prize_laureate_announcement] announcing the World Food Prize at the State Department last week is any indication of his ability to parse complicated issues, he might be better off windsurfing[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdzMLk9wHQ]. Because Kerry appears to have bought into the big ag-driven myth that only by relying on genetic engineering will we be able to feed the nine billion citizens of our planet by 2050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> And he enthusiastically endorsed granting this mockery of a prize to three biotech engineers, including Robert Fraley[http://www.monsanto.com/whoweare/Pages/robert-fraley-bio.aspx], executive vice president and chief technology officer at <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> and a pioneer of genetic engineering in agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind that <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> is a sponsor of the prize (and that the list of other backers reads like a who’s who[http://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/about_the_prize/sponsors/] of big ag and big food), or that we never get to know the names of either the nominees or the nominators. [1] Never mind that we’re not feeding the seven billion now, or that we’re sickening a billion of those with a never-before-seen form of malnourishment. Never mind that we already grow enough food to feed not only everyone on the planet but everyone who’s going to be born in the next 30 or 40 years. And never mind that, despite the hype, there’s scant evidence[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2056/doi/full/10.1080/14735903.2013.806408] that the involvement of genetic engineering in agriculture has done much to boost yields, reduce the use of chemicals or improve the food supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carping ends here. (I wrote about genetic engineering recently[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/why-do-g-m-o-s-need-protection/], and anyway, you’ll find plenty of griping[http://www.foodpolitics.com/2013/06/world-food-prize-goes-to-monsanto/] about this prize elsewhere[http://civileats.com/2013/06/21/and-the-world-food-prize-goes-to-monsanto/].) Rather, I thought I might ask a few friends and colleagues for their opinions on who might qualify for a food prize that wasn’t sponsored by its recipients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There already is such a thing, of course: the Food Sovereignty Prize[http://foodsovereigntyprize.org/the-honorees/]. But I’m countering the tremendous public relations boost <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> received from the World Food Prize, and instead showcasing just a few of the many people around the world who are working to establish sustainable and fair food systems. [2]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Gurian-Sherman, a plant pathologist at the <span class="companylink">Union of Concerned Scientists</span> [3] , mentioned Zeyaur Khan, who developed the “push-pull” system of pest control[http://twas.ictp.it/news-in-home-page/news/tianjin/push-pull-win-win] in sub-Saharan Africa. The system uses a legume [4] to “push” stem borers away from desired crops (mostly corn); at the same time, a “pull” crop is planted nearby, one that attracts the stem borers. “Input costs are low for farmers using this system,” says Gurian-Sherman, “while yields are often more than doubled.” Neither of those things can be said of the genetically modified Bt corn, which is designed to achieve the same results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raj Patel [5] , author of “Stuffed and Starved[http://rajpatel.org/2009/10/27/stuffed-and-starved/]” and a fellow at the Institute for Food and Development Policy, talked about the international peasant organization, La Via Campesina[http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/organisation-mainmenu-44]http://foodsovereigntyprize.org/the-honorees/[http://foodsovereigntyprize.org/the-honorees/] [6]: “At their 20th anniversary meeting earlier this month,&nbsp;La Via Campesina put violence against women at the forefront of their concerns around food sovereignty.” (Sixty percent[http://www.thp.org/learn_more/issues/know_your_world_facts_about_hunger_and_poverty] of the world’s undernourished people are female.) “That’s a very 21st century understanding of how hunger works, and how to end it,” he said. “And it’s far more powerful than the World Food Prize’s magic-beans talk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Lappé[http://www.smallplanet.org/], director of Food MythBusters[http://foodmyths.org/] and author, most recently, of “Diet for a Hot Planet,” nominates the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter[http://www.srfood.org/], a tireless traveler who has visited dozens of countries to learn about and address food insecurity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“De Schutter’s promotion of agroecological solutions,” says Lappé, “is rooted in the understanding that the chemical approach breeds debt and dependency on costly inputs like fertilizer, chemicals or genetically engineered seeds. As he told me a few years ago, ‘We have failed to end hunger using the traditional recipe that saw hunger as a technical problem, requiring only that we produce more. We’ve failed because we’ve underestimated the need to empower people and hold governments accountable.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of Lappés, Tom Philpott[http://www.motherjones.com/authors/tom-philpott], a food and agriculture writer at Mother Jones, brings up Anna’s mother, Frances Moore Lappé[http://smallplanet.org/about/frances/bio]: “Her central insights in “Diet for a Small Planet” — that growing grain to feed animals for meat is grievously inefficient; that the world already produces more than enough calories and the real problem is economic inequality — have become so commonplace in alternative-ag circles, so accepted, that we forget where they came from.&nbsp;(Now if policy makers would only listen!) She is an unsung intellectual giant, and her work remains vital today.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Michael Pollan, Knight professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and author, most recently, of “Cooked,” speaks about Miguel Altieri[http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people_profiles/miguel-altieri/], an agronomist at Berkeley and one of the world’s leading proponents of agroecology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Altieri has shown that casting the future of farming as either low-yield subsistence agriculture or export-oriented industrial farming is a false choice,” Pollan says. “Working with peasant farmers in Latin America, he has demonstrated that impressive increases in yield can be achieved by means of crop diversification, integrated pest management, and nutrient cycling.&nbsp;Small-holder farms currently produce half the world’s food, and Altieri’s work suggests that they could produce considerably more without shifting to capital-intensive export crops that often undermine rural economies and diminish food security. Altieri is also an eloquent advocate of ‘food sovereignty,’ the principle that localities and nations should be able to retain control of their food systems rather than leave them at the mercy of the global market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s hardly it: Without thinking hard, I could speak of Lester Brown[http://www.earth-policy.org/about_epi/C32/], founder of both Worldwatch and the <span class="companylink">Earth Policy Institute</span>; Matt Liebman[http://www.wallacechair.iastate.edu/] of Iowa State, whose pioneering work on sustainable agriculture I wrote about last year; and Vandana Shiva[http://www.unep.org/women_env/w_details.asp?w_id=107], who has devoted her life to so many progressive environmental and agricultural causes one doesn’t know where to begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this day hunger comes not because there is not enough food; it comes because some are unable to either buy it or produce it. Hunger represents inequality: there are no hungry people with money. Alleviating hunger, in part, is recognizing that the right to eat is equivalent to the right to breathe, which trumps the right to make profits. The real heroes in the world of food are those who recognize this, and who work to improve the kind of low-input agriculture upon which the majority of the world’s people — and the vast majority of farmers — rely. There are hundreds of people deserving of “prizes” for this kind of work. The bigwigs at <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> are not among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. “Similar to the Nobel Prizes,” a World Food Prize spokesperson e-mailed me when I inquired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Part of the problem, it seems to me, is that because the involvement of genetic engineering in agriculture is actively supported by the Federal government, we tend to forget there is a bigger, global picture. It’s hard to believe that any organization in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, for example, would be silly enough to give an award for genetically engineered crops — since they’re barely grown there. And, by the way, their agricultural yields are as good as ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. See Doug’s post about the World Food Prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Called desmodium, or tick-trefoil, if you’re interested. Planting legumes, of course, also fixes nitrogen in the soil, which means lowered use of chemical fertilizers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Who is a friend.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Chinese astronauts returned safely to earth on Wednesday after a 15-day mission that included docking exercises, a televised science demonstration for children and a phone call from their country's president, Xi Jinping, state television reported. The Shenzhou 10 capsule landed in northeast China, ending China's fifth manned space mission. China is seeking to master the skills and technology needed to operate a manned space lab for long stretches, and the crew on the latest flight practiced rendezvous and docking exercises with the orbiting Tiangong 1 space module, a small prototype of such a lab. China first sent an astronaut into space in 2003, and government engineers have said they may eventually try to send an astronaut to the moon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the edge of the solar system, there are no signs that proclaim, ''You are now entering interstellar space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched more than 35 years ago and now 11.5 billion miles from where it started, is closing in on this boundary. In recent years scientists have been waiting eagerly for it to become the first artificial object to leave the solar system and enter the wider reaches of the Milky Way, which they fully expect it to do. But there has been at least one false alarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, scientists reported that, no, Voyager 1 still had not reached interstellar space, but it had entered a region that no one expected and no one can yet explain, a curious zone that is almost certainly the last layer of our Sun's empire -- technically speaking, the heliosphere. Three papers published in the journal Science describe in detail the sudden and unpredicted changes encountered in the surroundings of Voyager 1, which left Earth about three months after the original ''Star Wars'' movie was released and is heading for the cosmos at 38,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists had expected that Voyager 1 would detect two telltale signs as it passed through the heliosheath, the outermost neighborhood of the solar system, which is thought to abut the heliopause, as the actual boundary is known. Happily, the key instruments on Voyager 1, as well as those on its twin, Voyager 2, are still working after all these years, and its nuclear power source will last until at least 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, one of the two events occurred, but not the other, leaving scientists perplexed. Scientists had predicted that at the boundary between solar system and interstellar space, the solar wind -- a stream of charged particles blown out by the Sun -- would fade away, and that Voyager 1 would no longer detect it. That happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also expected that the direction of the magnetic field would change as Voyager 1 emerged from the Sun's magnetic bubble. That did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nature is far more imaginative than we are,'' said Stamatios M. Krimigis, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory who is the principal investigator of an instrument that records charged particles hitting Voyager 1. Dr. Krimigis is an author of one of the papers in Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, the spacecraft -- which is roughly 1,600 pounds and would fit inside a cube about 13 feet on each side, according to NASA -- observed a momentary dip in the intensity of the solar wind. ''It was exciting,'' said Edward C. Stone, the project scientist for the two Voyagers. ''We had never seen such a drop before. It happened in less than a day. Then five days later, it was back up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-August, there was a deeper momentary dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Aug. 25, the solar wind dropped by a factor of more than a thousand, vanishing to imperceptible levels, and it has remained at essentially zero since. At the same time, the number of cosmic rays from outside the solar system jumped by 9.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked like we were outside,'' Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the magnetic field has steadily, stubbornly pointed in the same direction, indicating that Voyager 1 is still ensconced within the Sun's magnetic field. Scientists guess that in this region the magnetic fields of the solar system partly connect to those of the surrounding interstellar space, allowing the solar particles to escape. (Charged particles travel along magnetic field lines.) They have named the zone through which Voyager 1 is hurtling the heliosheath depletion region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's clear we do not have a model which explains all of this,'' Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 2, which is moving slightly more slowly and is not as far from the Sun, has not yet encountered this region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stone noted that when the two Voyagers launched in 1977 on a grand tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the space age was just 20 years old, and there was no way to know that NASA had built something that would last 35 years, long after it passed the planets. But the designers of the mission were prescient to be prepared if they lasted that long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It turns out that in fact we designed the cosmic ray instrument specifically for this phase of this mission,'' Dr. Stone said. ''We were planning, and it really paid off. We've begun to see what's outside even though the magnetic field says you're not outside.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for actually reaching the outside of the solar system, Dr. Stone said, ''it could be a few months, or it could be several more years.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the right stuff for a mother in space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen L. Nyberg, an American astronaut whose son, Jack, is 3 years old, is taking the next six months to find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with docking space ships and conducting science experiments, Ms. Nyberg, 43, who blasted off in late May, is using her tour at the International Space Station to grapple publicly with the difficulty of separating from a child because of work. She is cooperating with a Scandinavian television documentary on motherhood, has spoken to magazines on parenting and embraced the question her long business trip inevitably poses: how to choose between a dream job that requires long travel and the pull of children at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s a challenge because my son is 3. He will do a lot of growing in six months,’’ Ms. Nyberg told journalists before the launching, speaking from behind a glass wall to prevent last-minute infections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘But I will see a lot of video of him,’’ she said. ‘‘We will be very well connected. And he will be home with Daddy’’ — Doug Hurley, who is also an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I think it will be fun for him to see me there,’’ she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mother in space is not a new phenomenon: The first, Anna Fisher, an American, blasted off in 1984 aboard the space shuttle Discovery, leaving behind a 1-year-old daughter, Kristin. (Space authorities do not keep records on how many astronauts, the vast majority of whom are male, are also parents.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the International Space Station occupied by six people nearly permanently, and no fewer than three at any time, many more mothers and fathers are spending long spells away in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither NASA nor the <span class="companylink">Russian Federal Space Agency</span>, the lead partners in the International Space Station, has a policy on parenting and work at the station, where astronauts and cosmonauts typically spend six months on rotations. The choice to go, or not, is individual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, turning down too many trips can eventually harm a career — a point taken in Russia’s labor law, which allows mothers of children age 3 or younger and single fathers to opt out of work travel without repercussions. If they do choose to travel, the law specifies that they must provide their employer with a letter waiving their right to stay at home. U.S. labor law has no similar provision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘In Russia, normally, bringing up a child is more a woman’s obligation,’’ Nadezhda Ilyushina, a labor lawyer with the Goltsblat law firm in Moscow, explained. ‘‘A child needs female attention.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast of today’s space moms — gregarious public figures, open to media attention — with the experience of the first woman in space is striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Valentina Tereshkova, Russia’s first female cosmonaut and the first woman to fly in space, took off 50 years ago from this same site, she did not tell her family where she was going. She said she was headed to a competition of parachutists, as preparation for the flight was secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two Russian women have followed since — Svetlana Y. Savitskaya in the 1980s, and Elena V. Kondakova in the 1990s, who spent more than five months away from her daughter for her first spaceflight. Of the remaining 54 women who have been in space, 45 are American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For today’s working mothers in space, as for earthbound peers, the key to managing the conflict between work and home sometimes lies in blurring the distinction between the two realms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Stott, an American who flew to the International Space Station in 2009 when her son, Roman, was 7, said it helped to show him her training and to introduce him to her crewmates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s like a kid getting to see the toys their parents get to spend time with,’’ she said. ‘‘You want to make sure your family is involved with that adventure you are about to have.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cady Coleman, an American astronaut who spent Mother’s Day in space in 2011, took a stuffed tiger with her to photograph beside her experiments to amuse her 10-year-old son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nyberg, too, has taken some of her son’s toys so that he can see them float in zero gravity during video calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As female astronauts look for ways to cope with long separations from their families, they say they can count on the experience, and the example, of their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because liftoffs are emotional, and the fear lurks that Mom or Dad will not return, NASA prefers to keep families cloistered from public view as a launching approaches, a spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Russian Space Agency</span> takes a different approach. Families are very much welcome at the spartan launch site in Kazakhstan, although there is little room to allow even a few moments of privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Nyberg blasted off last month aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket, her crewmates included two other parents: Luca Parmitano, an Italian fighter pilot and flight engineer, and Fyodor N. Yurchikhin, a Russian space veteran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yurchikhin parted with his wife, Larisa, and daughters, Lena, 11, and Dania, 19, before a crowd of officials, pressing his gloved hand against the glass, winking and saying, ‘‘Don’t worry, my girls, everything will be all right.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he first flew, he said, Lena was 1 year old. ‘‘When I got back I asked, ‘Where was Daddy?’ and she pointed to the television set,’’ he said. Lena squirmed now at the recollection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nyberg, who had trained with the two men for years, said the three would ‘‘support each other knowing we have families at home whom we miss.’’</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- An unmanned rocket carrying Russian satellites veered off course and crashed a few seconds after liftoff early Tuesday, sending a cloud of highly toxic orange fumes toward the Kazakh city of Baikonur only 50 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears that the toxic cloud would waft into Baikonur were eased later in the day, however, after heavy rains dispersed the fumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photographs posted online had shown the ominous cloud stretching over buildings near the launching pad, and residents of Baikonur, population 70,000, had been instructed to stay indoors and refrain from using air conditioners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proton-M rocket rose just above its launching tower at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, wobbled and then tipped over into the desert in a ball of fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short flight on Tuesday was the fourth Proton failure in three years, and it was sure to raise safety questions among NASA officials and Western commercial clients of Russia's space services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> has relied on Russia to provide transportation for American astronauts headed to the International Space Station. But those spaceflights have been powered by a Soyuz rocket that has a far stronger safety record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Russian space agency</span> did not immediately offer an explanation for the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no reported injuries at the site of the accident, an area that Russia rents for rocket launchings. But the short flight, instead of a journey to space, made for one of the most prominent rocket disasters in Russia's space program in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''According to the preliminary estimates from the Russian side, there is no destruction and there are no casualties,'' the Kazakh space agency, KazCosmos, said in a statement, according to Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In video of the crash broadcast by Rossiya 24, a Russian state television channel, the satellites appeared to break apart from the nose cone as the rocket tumbled to earth. The station estimated their value at $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the live broadcast, the announcer noted as the rocket leaned over and flew horizontally, ''It seems something is not right.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash was another setback for the Proton rocket, a workaday booster for the Russian space program that is used for commercial and military payloads.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DENNIS OVERBYE   </div><div>311 words</div><div>4 July 2013</div><div>International Herald Tribune</div><div>INHT</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an astronomical body that circles the Sun but is no longer officially a planet, Pluto has a lot happening. Among other things, it has at least five moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> announced names for two of them, the latest to be discovered. Moon No.4 is now Kerberos, after the dog that guarded the entrance to the underworld in Greek mythology. Moon No.5 is Styx, for the river that souls had to cross to get to the underworld, and the goddess who ruled over it. Those are familiar names in the Plutonian family. In Greek mythology, Pluto, also known as Hades, was the lord of the underworld, a place that was also sometimes called Hades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011 and 2012, Kerberos and Styx were discovered by a team led by Mark Showalter of the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span>, which searches for extraterrestrial life. By tradition, that entitled him to suggest names for the new moons to the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span>. But Dr. Showalter held an Internet contest in which people could vote for names.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The favorite was Vulcan — the Greek god of fire and, perhaps more significant, the home planet of Mr. Spock of ‘‘Star Trek.’’ Dr. Showalter submitted the names Vulcan and Cerberus, later changed to the Greek spelling Kerberos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomical union rejected Vulcan because it had already been used as the name for a hypothetical planet between Mercury and the Sun, and it had no connection to the mythological underworld. Instead the moon-namers chose Kerberos and the next runner-up, Styx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Showalter said he was impressed by the creativity that went into some of the suggestions. ‘‘A few suggested ‘Potato and Potahto,’ which I thought was pretty funny,’’ he wrote. ‘‘Lots of children wrote in to suggest their siblings as ‘minions of Hades.’’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lily Koppel’s new book, “The Astronaut Wives Club,[http://www.astronautwivesclub.com/]” tells the true story of a group of courageous women who never rocketed into space but nevertheless dedicated their lives to the Mercury Space Program. In the following e-mail interview, Koppel explains how these women banded together in the face of incredible public scrutiny and personal stress — and also how they became style icons for a generation of American women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In your book, you describe the wives of the astronauts as “America’s first reality TV stars.” What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their saga, with its countless launch parties, and endless bottles of Champagne, at times seemed less like “The Right Stuff” and more like “The Valley of the Dolls” — or “The Real Housewives of NASA.” After their husbands became astronauts, Life magazine bought the rights to the couples’ “personal stories” for half a million dollars in 1959, so the astronaut families were all thrust into the spotlight. They were constantly exposed to the public, with reporters embedded in their suburban homes in the wonderfully named Houston “space burbs,” near NASA. The wives’ mantra throughout the space race was “Happy, proud and thrilled.” It was their “keep calm and carry on” motto, 1960s style, a way of coping with having their lives turned inside out. The press camped out on their lawns during the missions. They had tea with Jackie [Kennedy] and attended high-society galas. They had to smile perfectly after a Life magazine makeover, balancing their extravagantly lacquered rocket-style hairdos. (If you’ve seen the Slim Aarons photos of the young moms and matrons of Palm Beach, they actually look very astro-wifey.) They banded together to cope with the unique pressures of being married to spacemen — including dealing with absentee husbands constantly tempted by “Cape Cookies,” as the astronaut groupies were known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Describe the style of these women — did they dress conservatively because they were subjected to so much publicity, or did they strut into the spotlight?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the wives’ first bonding experiences was a photo shoot for the Sept. 21, 1959 cover of Life. They all wore pink lipstick that the editors changed to red in the magazine’s pages. The wives were shocked! As one told me, “We would never wear lipstick so prominent!” It had been the Eisenhower era, but suddenly it was the space age, and the flare of a bright patriotic red on the astro wives’ lips better promised America the moon and the stars. Platinum-blonde Rene Carpenter, who J.F.K. made clear was his favorite, was opinionated, savvy and went onto write her own women’s newspaper column. People magazine described her as the “archetypal astro wife.” By the end of the book, she has adopted a Gloria Steinem look and is hosting her own feminist television show, essentially taking on the patriarchy. As far as the astronaut wives’ personal style goes, the country did love them in “flag colors” — red, white and blue. Most of them were pretty conservative for the period, except for Carpenter. She wore loud dresses and clothes by Pierre Cardin and Rudi Gernreich. As she told reporter Myra MacPherson in a 1968 <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> profile, she usually found daring designer clothes on sale. “I’m not the understated type. It bores me to tears,” she said. She was photographed with her family’s pet husky, which became her impromptu fashion accessory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To what extent did America’s fascination with space in the ’60s and ’70s affect the way normal American women dressed? Did they take any cues from the wives of astronauts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Frontier style was of course not confined to the wives of astronauts. It would include skyrocketing hair; screaming miniskirts; vivid, sherbet-swirled Pucci dresses; and intergalactic white vinyl Mary Quant miniskirts — to match NASA’s gleaming spacecrafts. Soon, bouffant bubble hairdos appeared on runways, on sidewalks and in typing pools, along with frosted “Moon Drops” lipstick, advertised by Revlon in 1968 as “the lipstick to wear to the moon.” The rule of thumb seemed to be: Your hair should resemble your Jell-O mold. Later, during the heyday of the Apollo Moon missions, Pucci was all the rage. Norman Mailer called tall, model-thin astro wife Jane Conrad “sensationally attractive.” Her husband, Pete Conrad, went to the moon on Apollo 12 and Emilio Pucci specially designed a candy-colored jersey minidress for her to wear to the launch festivities. The space age marked the dawn of many daring runway fashions. Meanwhile, designers like André Courrèges, inspired by men traveling to the moon, created polka-dot haute couture space helmets and white plastic “Eskimo” sunglasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the course of reporting this book, you had the opportunity to meet and get to know many of the women in this story. What are they like today? Are any of them still fashion pioneers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I interviewed more than 30 women, individually and together in groups. They were very encouraging of one another and felt this was the right time to tell their story. They opened up their lives and homes to me, sharing their stories and memories (photo albums, scrapbooks — the <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> of the 1960s — and in the case of Betty Grissom, her vintage designer wardrobe purchased mostly from <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span> in the 1960s, including a pair of fur hot pants!). Marilyn Lovell (who people are already familiar with from the movie “Apollo 13″) was in Paris with her astronaut husband, Jim, recently, so their daughter, “Astrokid” Susan Lovell, joined me on book tour in Chicago. She is lovely and takes after her mom Marilyn with her fabulous style. Susan wore a pink dress swirling with paisley that looked like a 1960s Pucci. She also looks very much like her mom. Like many of the astro wives, she was wearing a piece of “space bling,” as I call it — a silver Apollo 8 medallion (worn on a sterling choker around her neck) that flew on the first manned mission to orbit the moon over Christmas 1968. Back then, when Jim was on the flight, he sent Marilyn — waiting back on earth — a special gift, a mink jacket from <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span> that arrived via a chauffeured Rolls-Royce and came with the most romantic card in the universe: “To Marilyn from the Man in the Moon.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, six people are living in a nearly windowless, white geodesic dome on the slopes of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano. They sleep in tiny rooms, use no more than eight minutes of shower time a week and subsist on a diet of freeze-dried, canned or preserved food. When they go outside, they exit through a mock air lock, clad head to toe in simulated spacesuits. The dome’s occupants are playing a serious version of the game of pretend — what if we lived on Mars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) project, funded in part by NASA, is a continuation of a long history of attempts to understand what will happen to people who travel through outer space for long periods of time. It’s more than a technical problem. Besides multistage rockets to propel a spacecraft out of Earth’s atmosphere, years of planning and precise calculations and massive amounts of fuel, traveling the tens of millions of miles to Mars will take a tremendous amount of time. With current technology, the journey takes more than eight months each way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which means that astronauts will get bored. In fact, a number of scientists say that — of all things — boredom is one of the biggest threats to a manned Mars mission, despite the thrill inherent in visiting another planet. And so, attention is being paid to the effects of boredom at HI-SEAS, and on the International Space Station. But because of the causes of chronic boredom, scientists say, research facilities in Antarctica might actually provide a better simulation of the stress of a journey to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most living things constantly seek out sensory stimulation — new smells, tastes, sights, sounds or experiences. Even single-celled amoebas will move to investigate new sources of light or heat, says Sheryl Bishop, who studies human performance in extreme environments at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Animals deprived of naturalistic environments and the mental stimulation that come with them can fall into repetitive, harmful patterns of behavior. Anybody of a certain age will remember zoos full of manically pacing tigers, bears gnawing on their metal cages and birds that groomed themselves bald — all a result, we now know, of their rather unstimulating lifestyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Human boredom isn’t quite as well understood, says James Danckert, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo. He’s currently working on what he says may be the first study of how our brain activity changes when we’re bored. Danckert is hoping to find out whether boredom is connected to a phenomenon called the “default network” — a background hum of brain activity that seems to remain on even when you aren’t directly focused on something. There’s a lot of observable activity in the brains of people who are staring at a blank screen — way more than anybody expected, Danckert says. The default network maps closely to the brain-activity patterns scientists see when someone’s mind is wandering. It suggests that what we call a restless mind is just that — a mind desperate for something to amuse it, searching frantically for stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boredom, it turns out, is a form of stress. Psychologically, it’s the mirror image of having too much work to do, says Jason Kring, president of the Society of Human Performance in Extreme Environments, an organization that studies how people live and work in space, underwater, on mountaintops and other high-risk places. If your brain does not receive sufficient stimulus, it might find something else to do — it daydreams, it wanders, it thinks about itself. If this goes on too long, it can affect your mind’s normal functioning. Chronic boredom correlates with depression and attention deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronaut candidates go through two years of training before they’re even approved to fly. And before they are chosen to be candidates, they have to compete against thousands of other applicants. The 2013 class, for instance, had more than 6,000 applicants and only 8 were chosen. Astronauts are rigorously tested for psychological as well as physical fitness. But no mission in NASA’s history has raised the specter of chronic boredom to the degree that a Mars mission does, because none have involved such a long journey through nothingness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if, millions of miles from home, a chronically bored astronaut forgets a certain safety procedure? What if he gets befuddled while reading an oxygen gauge? More important, Danckert and Kring say, bored people are also prone to taking risks, subconsciously seeking out stimulation when their environment bores them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cognitive and social psychologist Peter Suedfeld says that people will sometimes do reckless, stupid things when they suffer from chronic boredom. In Antarctica, where winter can cut scientists and crew off from the rest of the world for as long as nine months, the isolation can lead to strange behavior. Suedfeld told me he has heard about Antarctic researchers venturing outside in 40-below weather without proper clothing and without telling anyone else they were going out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diaries of early polar explorers are full of tales of extreme boredom, depression and desperate attempts at entertainment reminiscent of prisoners’ stories from solitary confinement. An important lesson that Antarctica can impart on a Mars expedition is this: even scientists on important missions can get excruciatingly bored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One effective way astronauts combat boredom is by staying busy with work. That’s a strategy at HI-SEAS, where the crew member Kate Greene told me that her schedule is packed — every hour planned and accounted for, from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed at night. Life on the International Space Station is similar. (In fact, historically, NASA’s problem has been overworking people: in 1973, the exhausted crew of Skylab 4 actually staged a relaxation rebellion and took an unscheduled day off.) But Antarctica is different from HI-SEAS or the International Space Station. Communications are limited. There’s nobody outside the base directing your day. Spectacular views vanish in a haze of white. It’s just you, the people you came in with, no way out and little to break up the monotony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so some researchers there have learned to actively fend off boredom by creating what you might call a unique office culture. They celebrate a ridiculous number of holidays, both traditional and invented. You need something to look forward to, Suedfeld says, and planning the events helps change the routine. Even Ernest Shackleton’s Antarctic crew found ways to put on skits and concerts. On one expedition, Shackleton brought a small printing press. At McMurdo Station, the 1983 winter crew created costumes, learned lines and acted out scenes from the movie “Escape From New York.” It’s possible that we may, someday, watch recordings of Mars-bound astronauts acting out other John Carpenter films. (It’s not so far-fetched. Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut, made a tribute to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” that racked up more than 16 million views on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might sound absurd, but many scientists say strategies like this are necessary because, without proper mental stimulus, we risk making a physically and technologically challenging endeavor into a psychologically grueling one. It would be catastrophic if humanity’s greatest voyage were brought low by the mind’s tendency to wander when left to its own devices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON -- Beyond the security gate at the Johnson Space Center's 1960s-era campus here, inside a two-story glass and concrete building with winding corridors, there is a floating laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harold G. White, a physicist and advanced propulsion engineer at NASA, beckoned toward a table full of equipment there on a recent afternoon: a laser, a camera, some small mirrors, a ring made of ceramic capacitors and a few other objects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other NASA engineers have been designing and redesigning these instruments, with the goal of using them to slightly warp the trajectory of a photon, changing the distance it travels in a certain area, and then observing the change with a device called an interferometer. So sensitive is their measuring equipment that it was picking up myriad earthly vibrations, including people walking nearby. So they recently moved into this lab, which floats atop a system of underground pneumatic piers, freeing it from seismic disturbances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team is trying to determine whether faster-than-light travel -- warp drive -- might someday be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warp drive. Like on ''Star Trek.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Space has been expanding since the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago,'' said Dr. White, 43, who runs the research project. ''And we know that when you look at some of the cosmology models, there were early periods of the universe where there was explosive inflation, where two points would've went receding away from each other at very rapid speeds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nature can do it,'' he said. ''So the question is, can we do it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein famously postulated that, as Dr. White put it, ''thou shalt not exceed the speed of light,'' essentially setting a galactic speed limit. But in 1994, a Mexican physicist, Miguel Alcubierre, theorized that faster-than-light speeds were possible in a way that did not contradict Einstein, though Dr. Alcubierre did not suggest anyone could actually construct the engine that could accomplish that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His theory involved harnessing the expansion and contraction of space itself. Under Dr. Alcubierre's hypothesis, a ship still couldn't exceed light speed in a local region of space. But a theoretical propulsion system he sketched out manipulated space-time by generating a so-called ''warp bubble'' that would expand space on one side of a spacecraft and contract it on another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this way, the spaceship will be pushed away from the Earth and pulled towards a distant star by space-time itself,'' Dr. Alcubierre wrote. Dr. White has likened it to stepping onto a moving walkway at an airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Alcubierre's paper was purely theoretical, and suggested insurmountable hurdles. Among other things, it depended on large amounts of a little understood or observed type of ''exotic matter'' that violates typical physical laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White believes that advances he and others have made render warp speed less implausible. Among other things, he has redesigned the theoretical warp-traveling spacecraft -- and in particular a ring around it that is key to its propulsion system -- in a way that he believes will greatly reduce the energy requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is quick to offer up his own caveats, however, saying his warp research is akin to a university science project that is just trying to prove that a microscopic warp bubble can be detected in a lab. ''We're not bolting this to a spacecraft,'' he said of the warp technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White was an engineer with a background in the aerospace industry when he came to NASA in 2000, starting his career at the agency by operating the arms of space shuttles. He got his doctorate in physics from <span class="companylink">Rice University</span> in 2008, and now works on a range of projects aimed at taking NASA beyond the fiery rockets that have long characterized space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA, Dr. White's warp speed experiments represent a rounding error in its budget, with about $50,000 spent on equipment in an agency that spends nearly $18 billion annually. The agency is far more focused on more achievable projects -- building the next generation Orion series spacecraft, working on the International Space Station and preparing for a planned future mission to capture an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has made internal resources available for the project and freed up other engineers to assist Dr. White. It has also restored the pneumatic system in the laboratory Dr. White is using, to allow it to float. The lab was once used to test equipment for Apollo missions and has control panels underneath it that look like they belong in a fallout shelter that time forgot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Stich, the deputy director of engineering at the Johnson Space Center, said, ''You always have to be looking towards the future.'' He held up his iPhone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Forty years ago, this was 'Star Trek,' Captain Kirk talking on a communicator whenever he wanted to,'' he said. ''But today it exists because people made the battery technology that allows this device to exist, worked on the software technology, worked on the computational technology, the touch screen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theoretically, a warp drive could cut the travel time between stars from tens of thousands of years to weeks or months. But we should probably not book reservations anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My personal opinion is that the idea is crazy for now,'' said Edwin F. Taylor, a former editor of The American Journal of Physics and senior research scientist at M.I.T. ''Check with me in a hundred years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Richard Obousy, a physicist who is president of Icarus Interstellar, a nonprofit group composed of volunteers collaborating on starship design, said ''it is not airy-fairy, pie in the sky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We tend to overestimate what we can do on short time scales, but I think we massively underestimate what we can do on longer time scales,'' he said of the work of Dr. White, who is a friend and Icarus collaborator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White likened his experiments to the early stages of the Manhattan Project, which were aimed at creating a very small nuclear reaction merely as proof that it could be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They tried to go through and demonstrate a nuclear reactor and generate half a watt,'' he said. ''That's not something you're going to market. Nobody's going to buy that. It's just making sure they understood the physics and science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil deGrasse Tyson, the well-known astrophysicist at the <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, said some leap beyond our current technology would be needed to make interstellar travel feasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Routine travel among the stars is impossible without new discoveries regarding the fabric of space and time, or capability to manipulate it for our needs,'' he said, adding, ''By my read, the idea of a functioning warp drive remains far-fetched, but the real take-away is that people are thinking about it -- reminding us all that the urge to explore continues to run deep in our species.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, one of the most dubious is Dr. Alcubierre himself. He listed a number of concerns, starting with the vast amounts of exotic matter that would be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The warp drive on this ground alone is impossible,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he posed a more fundamental question: How would you turn it on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At speeds larger than the speed of light, the front of the warp bubble cannot be reached by any signal from within the ship,'' he said. ''This does not just mean we can't turn it off; it is much worse. It means we can't even turn it on in the first place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White, who has never spoken to Dr. Alcubierre, said ''I appreciate his thoughts. I don't know whether I agree with all of his observations, based on some work I've done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He and I could certainly debate for a very long time,'' he added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything new this week was old. Paleontologists in Utah discovered a cowlike species of dinosaur (about 65 million years old), and archaeologists in Scotland found what may be the world’s first lunar calendar (10,000 years old). Meanwhile, astronomers tell us that all of Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]’s gold was formed by ancient stars colliding (more than 4.5 billion years ago) and that there is a moon[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/moon/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] orbiting Neptune[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/neptune_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] we all somehow failed to notice (also quite old).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paleontology: Call Me Big Nose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looked like a cow with forward-facing horns and a big, bulbous snout. But Nasutoceratops — literally “big-nosed horned face” — was a relative of triceratops, living in what is now southern Utah during the late Cretaceous period. Paleontologists at the Utah Museum of Natural History, writing in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1766/20131186], identified it using fossil records unearthed in the state. The Nasutoceratops had distinctive long, curved horns, a relatively understated neck flourish and pronounced nose, the researchers said. Alas, its sense of smell was not proportional to its proboscis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archaeology: Times Past</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDEverything new this week was old. Paleontologists in Utah discovered a cowlike species of dinosaur (about 65 million years old), and archaeologists in Scotland found what may be the world's first lunar calendar (10,000 years old). Meanwhile, astronomers tell us that all of Earth's gold was formed by ancient stars colliding (more than 4.5 billion years ago) and that there is a moon orbiting Neptune we all somehow failed to notice (also quite old).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paleontology: Call Me Big Nose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looked like a cow with forward-facing horns and a big, bulbous snout. But Nasutoceratops -- literally ''big-nosed horned face'' -- was a relative of triceratops, living in what is now southern Utah during the late Cretaceous period. Paleontologists at the Utah Museum of Natural History, writing in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, identified it using fossil records unearthed in the state. The Nasutoceratops had distinctive long, curved horns, a relatively understated neck flourish and pronounced nose, the researchers said. Alas, its sense of smell was not proportional to its proboscis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL, South Korea -- Satellite images show that North Korea has halted work at a complex believed to have been intended to allow it to launch bigger and longer-range rockets, a Washington-based research organization reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization, the U.S.-Korea Institute at <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span>, and others have been using commercial satellite imagery to monitor the complex, the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, in northeastern North Korea. They have previously detected the building of a new launching pad, missile assembly building and launch control center that they believe are designed to launch larger rockets capable of flying longer distances and delivering heavier payloads than the North's Unha-3 rocket, which successfully thrust a satellite into orbit in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea says it launches rockets for the peaceful purpose of sending scientific satellites into orbit. But Washington sees them as a cover for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could one day strike targets as far away as North America with nuclear warheads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute first noticed that the work at Tonghae stopped at the end of 2012. In its latest update, posted on its Web site 38 North, it said on Tuesday that the construction had not resumed as of late May, although it was not clear what had caused the seven-month halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if North Korea resumes work, the lull means that the new projects might not be completed until 2017, a year longer than earlier estimates, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Initial speculation at the end of 2012 focused on the need for equipment and troops elsewhere to repair damage done by last summer's typhoons and heavy rains,'' it said. ''That explanation now seems less plausible given the amount of time that has passed since last year's rains.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alternative explanation is that the North has decided that testing conducted at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, in northwestern North Korea, will be sufficient to support its development of larger rockets, the institute said, without citing any evidence to support its theory. North Korea conducted its December rocket launching from the Sohae station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Or the stoppage may reflect a decision either to slow or even halt development of larger rockets,'' it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such an analysis contradicts recent official pronouncements from Pyongyang. Despite international criticism and United Nations sanctions, North Korea has vowed to continue to build and launch more powerful rockets. Again using satellite imagery, 38 North said on July 10 that North Korea might have conducted engine tests for a more powerful rocket at the Sohae facility in late March or early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During military tensions that followed the North's nuclear test in February and ensuing sanctions from the <span class="companylink">United Nations Security Council</span>, North Korea claimed to have the ability to hit the continental United States with nuclear missiles. American intelligence agencies are divided over how close the North has come to attaining such an ability. Still, Washington announced plans to deploy more missile interceptors on the West Coast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phrase ''scientific revolution'' tends to get overused. But there is one happening right now that could arguably alter the entire trajectory of human existence by profoundly realigning what we know of the complex, undulating road that has taken us from atoms adrift in the void to living, thinking beings in merely four billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using techniques of exquisite sensitivity and technological finesse, astronomers have spent the past two decades on an astonishing voyage of cosmic discovery. They have found that the universe is full of planets: Cold, small, and dark next to their large and glaring suns, these worlds have previously been hidden from us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet they are a critical piece of a great puzzle. In many ways they represent the final order of unfinished business for the Copernican worldview. We've never been able to completely convince ourselves that we're nothing special, not central to the cosmos, because our solar system has been the only planetary collective known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planets are tiny crumbs of matter -- leftovers from epochs where gravity collapses and compresses vast interstellar nebulae into new stars. They're fossil detritus, matter that gathers like droplets on a cooling windowpane, surviving as dust and gas around them evaporates and dissipates. To spot them represents a challenge that has been compared to looking across thousands of miles to see a firefly buzzing around a brilliant searchlight. But they can be spotted, both deliberately and serendipitously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like everything else, they exert a gravitational pull, tugging their parent stars into a gently wobbling motion that we can now detect, even if it's barely more than the pace of a slow walker seen from hundreds of trillions of miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, by sheer random alignment, they appear to flit across the face of their suns. From our perspective the star's light dims minutely, mere fractions of a percent, as the planet gets in the way. And if we patiently monitor millions of stars we will occasionally see one brighten and fade -- a manifestation of Einstein's physics as another star, and its planets, drifts between us and the stellar backdrop, serving as a gravitational lens, an interstellar magnifying glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result of extraordinary efforts to watch for these subtle signatures is that we now have firm evidence for thousands of planets, around thousands of stars. We also know something about these worlds, their sizes, their orbits, often their ages. In a handful of cases, for planets of Jupiter's or Neptune's size, we have even measured the temperature of their upper atmospheres and sniffed at their gaseous chemistry, finding substances like sodium, methane and water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a rich bounty that has taken even scientists by surprise, but it's only the beginning, because the numbers are pointing to something even more remarkable in our future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how conservative or optimistic we are, the statistics tell us that something like an astonishing one out of every seven stars must harbor a planet similar in size to the Earth, and at roughly the right orbital distance to allow for the possibility of a temperate surface environment. In other words, roughly 15 percent of all suns could, in principle, be hosting a place suitable for life as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since our galaxy contains at least 200 billion stars, this implies a vast arena for the universe's ubiquitous carbon chemistry to play in -- a process that, as here on Earth, might lead to the complex machinery of life. Indeed, there is a 95-percent confidence -- give or take a few percent -- that one of these worlds could be within a mere 16 light years of us. That's a stone's throw, practically our galactic backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's really only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Even in our own solar system we have our suspicions that environments inside ice-rich moons around Jupiter or Saturn could also represent life-amenable zones. We know too that the conditions humans find palatable are not the same as those for countless other species. The opportunities for life seem enormous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This incredible abundance of planets in our galaxy is a portent of what's to come; the first shot fired; the first statement of intent in a new revolution. It doesn't yet tell us whether or not we are alone in the universe or, as in the Copernican outlook, merely one among billions. But it is already telling us something shockingly profound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the universe makes so many planets, the chances of our finding others that we can actually study in detail increases enormously. Until now there was nothing we knew about the universe that made this inevitable. Planets could have been few and far between. Even if there were billions in total, they could have been scattered thinly across the cosmos. Thus, it was still a possibility that we'd forever be like the lonely ship's spotter, vainly looking for land from the crow's-nest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the age-old dream of finding other life in the cosmos, whether silent microbes or noisy technological civilizations, has just taken a very sharp turn for the positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It really is true therefore that we stand on the verge of learning more about the nature of life, and of our own significance, than at any other time in human history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was -- and is -- a big deal for us to peer into the microscopic to understand the atomic and subatomic. It has also been momentous to learn that the entirety of existence, our universe, originated some 13.8 billion years ago. And yes, we reached a pinnacle of self-discovery by realizing that we are merely one expression of an awesomely complex and ancient system of molecular machinery, evolving and selecting itself across the ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to discover whether or not we are alone, whether or not something akin to this Earth has happened somewhere else, and perhaps, just perhaps, whether or not there are other minds, on other worlds, thinking these same kinds of thoughts? That's big, perhaps the biggest thing that could ever happen to a species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could have been impossible to ever address the question, but we now know that nature has provided us with a shot at finding out, that there are billions upon billions of places to search. That really is the start of a revolution.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is known, informally, as the asteroid-lasso plan: NASA wants to launch an unmanned spacecraft in 2018 that would capture a small asteroid -- maybe 7 to 10 yards wide -- haul it closer to Earth, then send astronauts up to examine it, in 2021 or beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the space agency has encountered a stubborn technical problem: Congressional Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, there is bipartisan support (or disapproval) in Congress for NASA's bolder plans, particularly when they involve human spaceflight. What squabbling does take place tends to pit lawmakers from states with big NASA presences, like Florida and Texas, against those with fewer vested interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, however, the science committee in the Republican-controlled House voted to bar NASA from pursuing that faraway rock. In a straight party vote -- 22 Republicans for, 17 Democrats against -- the committee laid out a road map for NASA for the next three years that brushed aside the asteroid capture plan, the centerpiece of the Obama administration's agenda for space exploration. The plan, instead, included new marching orders, telling NASA to send astronauts back to the Moon, set up a base there and then aim for Mars (and to do so with less money than requested).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A costly and complex distraction,'' is how one Republican critic, Representative Steven Palazzo of Mississippi, described the asteroid mission. Other legislators complained that the project seemed far-fetched and poorly articulated, and that it would not advance America's bragging rights in space the way a return to the Moon could. The bill awaits a vote by the full House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA and its rocket scientists are trying to figure out how to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama had asked them to find a way to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s. They presented their plan in April, describing it, perhaps immodestly, as a way to ''protect our planet'' from dangerous asteroids in addition to making strides in human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A non-NASA study had estimated the total cost of capturing and redirecting an asteroid at $2.6 billion. New analysis by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is in charge of the robotic part of the mission, put the cost at perhaps half that -- $1 billion plus the cost of the rocket, said Charles Elachi, the laboratory's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It allows us to get to an asteroid four years ahead of time,'' said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, a former astronaut and a proponent of the asteroid plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nelson, like NASA officials, ticked off other possible benefits: The agency would learn how to push around heavy objects in space, which could help if a large asteroid were on a collision course with Earth; and NASA would develop technologies like thinner, lighter solar panels that would be useful for a human mission to Mars in the 2030s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And the fourth thing it does is, if it ends up an interesting asteroid, then we've got the possibility of the science of mining an asteroid,'' Mr. Nelson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal, unveiled in April as part of Mr. Obama's budget, is far from dead. On Tuesday, a committee in the Democrat-controlled Senate is scheduled to work on its version of the bill, one that makes no mention of capturing asteroids but gives leeway to NASA to do whatever it thinks best for getting to Mars. On the same day, experts will convene at NASA headquarters in Washington to review work on the asteroid mission so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As yet, those experts have not pinpointed an asteroid to kidnap, but the idea is this: First, build a robotic spacecraft with a novel inflatable cone-shaped structure that could envelop the asteroid (which will be tricky to catch, because it will probably be spinning). Next, meet the space rock as it swings by the vicinity of the Earth and the Moon. Then, after essentially wrapping the asteroid in a bag (no lassos are actually involved), the spacecraft would lug it into orbit above the Moon, a slow do-si-do of mechanics that could take a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I think this is a very doable mission,'' said Brian Muirhead, the chief engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, astronauts would travel aboard a giant new rocket that NASA is designing, to meet the asteroid for a closer look. Their trip would give NASA the opportunity to test its deep-space spacecraft, the Orion capsule, as well as its procedures for helping astronauts work with asteroids, which have almost no gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asteroids have been having their moment in the news, in part because of the terrifying asteroid explosion over Russia in February, which injured about 1,500 people. Last month, NASA announced an Asteroid Grand Challenge, inviting people and organizations to collaborate in finding asteroids that threaten Earth and proposing solutions. On Friday, the agency said it had received more than 400 responses to the challenge and suggestions to help with the asteroid capture mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, at least two private companies have announced intentions to mine asteroids for rare metals, arguing that supplies on Earth are dwindling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is near unanimity in Congress and NASA that the ultimate goal is to send people to Mars, but the logistical challenges and costs are too big to conquer right away. NASA officials depict the asteroid capture plan as an elegant interim step, one that would send humans deeper into space than before and break new ground in rocket technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Republicans on the House science committee complained this month that the proposal came ''out of the blue,'' lacking much explanation from NASA officials, support from scientists or cost analysis. Some Democrats on the committee were also skeptical, but most were willing to hear NASA out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was never very excited about it,'' said Representative Donna F. Edwards of Maryland, a Democrat on the committee. However, she was much more critical of the Republican alternative that passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some Democrats, the Republican objections came across as part of a larger strategy to block Mr. Obama on all fronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really thought that was really a direct insult to the president,'' said Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, NASA's bipartisan support in Congress dates to its founding in 1958 in the aftermath of Russia's launching of Sputnik. And it is far too soon to say whether the House Republicans' objections will ultimately scuttle the asteroid plan. But some longtime NASA observers wonder if the differing views can coalesce to give NASA clear marching orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as the Republicans control the House and Mr. Obama is president, I don't think that agreement will happen, and we'll just muddle through,'' said John M. Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Democrats say that the current House bill, the NASA Authorization Act of 2013, would give the agency an impossible mission, reviving expensive ambitions to send astronauts back to the Moon while proposing to cut NASA's budget to $16.6 billion for the next fiscal year, down from $17.8 billion appropriated this year. Republicans have taken the position that spending plans should take into account the current budget sequester. The Senate authorization bill, being taken up this week, proposes $18.1 billion for NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the fiscal climate, the Republicans' Moon ambitions are just not possible, according to Louis D. Friedman, a former executive director of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit group that promotes space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly, it comes down to this or nothing,'' Dr. Friedman said, referring to the asteroid plan. ''This at least does everything we need in the American space program at a price we can afford while we debate when we are going to make those bigger commitments.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first anniversary of its landing, halfway through its primary mission to Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover still has a long way to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be exact, 4.4 miles. That is the distance to the foothills of Mount Sharp, an 18,000-foot mountain whose rocks could provide clues to a time on Mars when life could have thrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Curiosity is driving at a careful pace -- up to 100 yards a day -- the journey will take eight or nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, science is secondary as Curiosity crawls across a barren, largely uninteresting landscape. ''Pretty much pure driving, pedal to the metal,'' said John P. Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interactive feature offers a chronology of where Curiosity has been and what it has done so far; new images and information will be added as the rover progresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to NASA, Curiosity has already traveled more than a mile, taken more than 36,700 images and fired 75,000 laser shots to analyze rocks and soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first day -- or sol, the term for a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth -- began in the early morning of Aug. 6, 2012. (At mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, it was late on Aug. 5.) The spacecraft carrying Curiosity pierced the top of the Martian atmosphere at more than 13,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In precisely choreographed maneuvers so risky that NASA called them ''seven minutes of terror,'' Curiosity was dropped to an undamaged standstill on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover, roughly the size of a car, ended up right where it had been aimed -- within Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide scar from an asteroid impact at least 3.5 billion years ago. In that time layers of sediment filled much of the crater, which were then somehow carved away, leaving Mount Sharp at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observations from orbit pointed to the presence of clay minerals at the base of the mountain, named in honor of Robert P. Sharp, a prominent geologist and Mars expert. Because clays form in water that has a neutral pH, that made Gale Crater a promising place to look for signs that Mars could have once been hospitable for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before it headed toward Mount Sharp, Dr. Grotzinger's team decided to send Curiosity on a detour to investigate terrain that looked to be an intriguing confluence of three different rock types. Along the way, Curiosity spotted what looked like an ancient streambed. At the site, in the first rock it drilled on Feb. 8 (Sol 182), it struck the jackpot -- clays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This rock in this part of Mars formed in watery conditions that were surprisingly Earthlike. ''Unquestionably, Mars was a habitable planet in its ancient past,'' Dr. Grotzinger said. Curiosity, however, does not have instruments that can directly search for life, past or present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the primary mission is scheduled for only two years, Curiosity could be exploring Mars far longer. ''It looks great,'' said Jennifer H. Trosper, the deputy project manager. ''I think over all the rover has worked better than expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lest anyone think that everything on the $2.5 billion mission would always work perfectly, a computer memory glitch in late February knocked Curiosity out of action for a couple of weeks. ''This is a very sober reminder that the rover ultimately has a finite lifetime,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who was it that first said that people are stardust?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people, of a certain age, might say Joni Mitchell, who sang, “We are stardust, we are golden, and we’ve got to get ourselves back to the gar-ar-den,” in her paean to the Woodstock festival. Others will say Carl Sagan, the author and host of “Cosmos.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the answer goes back before those acolytes of beauty and consciousness were born. In 1929, the Harvard astronomer Harlow Shapley declared, “We organic beings who call ourselves humans are made of the same stuff as the stars” — a remarkable observation, considering that at the time nobody even knew what made the stars shine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be 30 years before Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed in a classic paper[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:3916/abstract/RMP/v29/i4/p547_1] that the atoms that compose us are not only the same as the ones in stars — most of them were actually manufactured in stars. Starting from primordial hydrogen and helium, denser elements like iron, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen were built up in a series of thermonuclear reactions and then spewed into space when these stars died and exploded as supernovas in a final thermonuclear frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any gardener knows that ashes make good fertilizer. Our atoms were once in stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of all this by a pair of recent news items. One involved dung beetles, among the least lordly occupants of this cosmic garden, which apparently navigate by orienting themselves to the light of the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other was the announcement[http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3960] last month that astronomers had tentatively traced the existence of gold in the universe to a cataclysm known as a gamma-ray burst, which can light up a galaxy. As Joel Achenbach wrote[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/wp/2013/07/17/blingnova-the-origin-of-gold/] in The Washington Post, “The bling apparently begins with a blam.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blam in question happened — or rather was noticed here on Earth — on June 3. It was then that astronomers, alerted by a brief flash of high-energy gamma rays in the sky, think a pair of dead, ultradense neutron stars collided, leaving behind only a distant radioactive glow. Edo Berger of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> said the explosion could have created an amount of gold equivalent to the mass of 20 Earth Moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neutron stars are themselves a result of cataclysms, those supernova explosions that can squeeze the space out of atoms and compress a mass more than the Sun into a ball 10 miles across — essentially a great ball of neutrons, hence the name. On Earth, a teaspoon of the stuff would weigh about five billion tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have always wondered whether ordinary supernova explosions could produce very heavy elements like gold, whose nucleus has 79 protons and 118 neutrons — a far cry from the single proton that is a hydrogen nucleus. If a pair of neutron stars are in orbit around each other, they can collide — a second cosmic act that will add to the universe’s repertory of elements, the bling from blam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Dr. Berger and his colleagues suggested that all the gold in the universe might have been produced by neutron star collisions, which have been termed “kilonova” explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course we aspiring gardeners have other names for what is left behind after an object’s energy has been metabolized into light and heat to nurture the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us back to the lowly dung beetle, the scarab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These creatures[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/10/science/in-recycling-waste-the-noble-scarab-is-peerless.html], which live on the feces of larger animals, have a problem. Once a beetle has found some dung and rolled part of it into a ball, he’s got to get it out of there, rolling it in a straight line away from the dung pile, or the other beetles will come and poach it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How they manage this, even on moonless nights when obvious cues and landmarks are absent or invisible, has been a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last January a team of Swedish and South African researchers reported that African dung beetles, Scarabaeus satyrus, can use the Milky Way as their guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of experiments in a game preserve and a planetarium, a team led by Marie Dacke of Lund University in Sweden found that when the beetles were fitted with little caps that prevented them from seeing the sky or the stars were clouded out, the beetles wandered aimlessly, putting their little dung treasures at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a starlit sky, or just a dim band representing the disk of our humble home galaxy, is a enough to keep them on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Although this is the first description of an insect using the Milky Way for their orientation, this ability might turn out to be widespread in the animal kingdom,” the scientists wrote[http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982212015072] in Current Biology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s hard to imagine a more beautiful or humbling connection between the sacred and the profane, the microscopic and the large, inner space and outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milky Way is one of nature’s grandest creations: hundreds of billions of glittering stars, wreathed in ribbons of gas and dust, a cloudy, starry pinwheel so vast that a light beam would take 100,000 years to cross it and the Sun with its planetary entourage takes a quarter of a billion years to circle it once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is only one of countless galaxies, scattered like sand from here to eternity, rushing outward in the great expansion, whose meaning, if we are honest, is as fathomless to us as it is to a scarab pushing its carefully wrought investment portfolio through this garden of Earthy delights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarabs were sacred to the ancient Egyptians for their ability to create life from waste. They were a symbol of the eternal renewal of life from death, not unlike the waxing and the waning of the stars themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egyptians wore representations of them as amulets. And wouldn’t you know, in one of the ultimate symbols of recycling, some of them were even gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 8, 2013, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the connections between stars, gold, dung beetles and people misspelled the term for explosions resulting from collisions of neutron stars. They are known as kilonova explosions, not kilanova.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As lawmakers in Washington continue to wrangle over NASA's financing and expeditions, a top administrator at the agency who played a large role in drafting the Obama administration's controversial space policies is bowing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori B. Garver, NASA's deputy administrator for the past four years, will leave next month to take the top staff position at the <span class="companylink">Air Line Pilots Association</span>, a union representing 50,000 pilots in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's time to take on new challenges,'' Ms. Garver said in an interview on Tuesday. ''I feel like I've accomplished so many of the objectives I set out to do here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver, 52, who works at NASA headquarters in Washington, was often the public face -- and lightning rod for criticism -- of the Obama administration's efforts to push NASA in new directions. The White House wanted to cancel the program started under President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon, and scale back the agency's role in designing rockets and spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver, who previously worked both inside and outside of NASA, served as an adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. She switched to Mr. Obama's team after he won the nomination, and following the election she played a central role on the transition team for shaping NASA policy. In July 2009, the Senate confirmed Ms. Garver's appointment as NASA deputy administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She has been an indispensable partner in our efforts to keep NASA on a trajectory of progress and innovation,'' the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., wrote in an e-mail to NASA employees. ''In a time of great change and challenge, she has been a remarkable leader who has consistently shown great vision and commitment to NASA and the aerospace industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver advocated a greater for role for ''New Space'' -- the involvement of entrepreneurial companies, which many space advocates say they believe are more nimble and efficient than aerospace titans like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> that NASA has traditionally relied on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main goal was really to align NASA in a way that allowed them to be more sustainable and innovative in the 21st century,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some of the proposals received a cool, sometimes hostile, reception in Washington. Members of Congress in both parties complained that the plans often did not seem fully thought out, and that the administration did a poor job of explaining -- to the agency, lawmakers, contractors and the general public -- NASA's new mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 2011 budget proposal, the Obama administration sought to cancel the moon program and take a five-year hiatus on any development of rockets or spacecraft capable of taking astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit to more distant destinations like the moon, asteroids or Mars. Ms. Garver and other NASA officials argued that devoting the rocket money to more fundamental space technologies would actually speed future human exploration of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Democrats and Republicans were unconvinced and directed NASA to build a huge new rocket, now known as the Space Launch System, and a capsule, known as Orion, where astronauts would live during their excursions into deep space. The first flight with humans is scheduled for 2021, but so far, no consensus has emerged on where the new spacecraft should take NASA astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the legacies has been the decline and deterioration of relationships between the White House and Congress over the direction of space policy,'' said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span> and a space adviser to the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. ''She was part of it. I don't put sole blame on her. She was one of the more visible faces of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the administration did achieve several of its other goals, including turning to the private sector to provide transportation for astronauts going to and from the International Space Station. In the past, NASA designed and operated its spacecraft like the space shuttle, and it was a major cultural change within the agency to rely more on outsiders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was critical to reduce the cost of getting to and from space,'' Ms. Garver said. The effort, known as commercial crew, has NASA financing attempts by three commercial companies -- <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> and <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span> -- and she said it is ''clearly a goal that is now well, well established on its way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials also persuaded Congress to provide money for next-generation technologies like new propulsion systems and in-space fueling stations for spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not embarrassed at all by compromise,'' Ms. Garver said. ''That is something that this country can probably do a little more of these days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past few months, Ms. Garver has been advocating a proposal to capture a small asteroid and bring it into orbit around the moon for exploration by astronauts. NASA officials say the effort would have possible important side effects, like advancing ways to find asteroids with the potential to collide with Earth. They also say the robotic spacecraft that would capture the asteroid would demonstrate propulsion and solar cell technology that could later be deployed for a human mission to Mars, and the asteroid would provide an interesting destination for the astronauts on the first Space Launch System mission in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That proposal, too, has been met skeptically, with Republicans in the House of Representatives disliking it so much that they are seeking to explicitly prohibit NASA from pursuing it. They instead would like to revive the moon as the next destination for NASA astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver expressed some frustration that some in Congress want NASA to build the new rocket, but are not willing to let the space agency figure out how best to use it. ''It is disappointing where there is just an unwillingness to look at things on their merit,'' she said. ''We have put together a mission concept that really does take advantage of the very vehicle that Congress has funded for us to build.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PEOPLE already worried about the candid cameras on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Glass and low-flying drones can add a new potential snooper to the list: cameras on inexpensive, low-orbiting microsatellites that will soon be sending back frequent, low-cost snapshots of most of Earth's populated regions from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They won't be the first cameras out there, of course. Earth-imaging satellites the size of vans have long circled the globe, but those cost millions of dollars each to build and launch, in part because of their weight and specialized hardware. The new satellites, with some of the same off-the-shelf miniaturized technology that has made smartphones and laptops so powerful, will be far less expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view from high up is rich in untapped data, said Paul Saffo, a forecaster and essayist. He expects the new satellite services to find many customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies, for example, could use the satellites' ''before'' and ''after'' views to monitor insured property and validate claims after a disaster. Businesses that update online maps for geologists, city planners or disaster relief officials could be customers, too. The images could also be used to monitor problems like deforestation, melting icecaps and overfishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And food companies and commodities traders could use the images to keep track of crops and agricultural yields all over the planet, Mr. Saffo predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the images are also likely to be viewed as the latest mixed blessing by people already apprehensive of Big Brother-like surveillance in their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First into space in the microsatellite business will be the San Francisco company Planet Labs, which plans to launch a fleet of 28 small satellites at the end of the year that will photograph the planet around the clock, with frequent updates. The company has already sent up two trial satellites for test runs, and will dispatch the entire set, called Flock-1, in December, said Will Marshall, a co-founder of the company and a former NASA scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Planet Labs' satellites won't be able to distinguish your face or read your license plate -- the cameras don't have that level of resolution. But the frequency with which images can be updated could raise privacy questions, said Timothy Edgar, a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at <span class="companylink">Brown University</span> and a former director of privacy and civil liberties in the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Edgar contrasted the satellite images with those provided by <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth -- the ones that people zoom in on to see, for example, an aerial view of their homes.''That's just an image of your house that was probably taken a few years ago,'' he said. ''It may feel like you are being watched, but you aren't. It's just a static picture that's most likely several years old.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a satellite that regularly passes over your cabin deep in the woods and photographs a car that is sometimes parked there -- and sometimes not -- has different ramifications. ''It can show a pattern, for example, when you appear to be at home and when you're away,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planet Labs' technology, like that at other microsatellite companies such as Skybox Imaging, are benefiting from the progressive miniaturization of consumer electronic components, along with a federal effort to commercialize space. ''What we are seeing are smaller satellites that have similar capabilities to much larger, traditional satellites,'' said Glenn Lightsey, a professor at the University of Texas who founded and directs the Texas Spacecraft Lab there. ''Since putting a satellite in orbit is a function of its size, these new satellites are able to get into orbit at a much lower cost,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lightweight satellites have another advantage: the companies don't have to spend millions of dollars for a rocket to get them into space. Instead, they can hitch a ride as a secondary payload on a rocket already making the trip. Planet Labs will send its satellites on an Antares rocket when it heads out on a cargo transportation flight to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have flocked to the new satellite companies, though neither Planet Labs nor Skybox Imaging has disclosed what it will charge customers. Planet Labs has obtained $13.1 million in funding, led by Steve Jurvetson, managing director of <span class="companylink">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</span>. Other backers include <span class="companylink">O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures</span>, Data Collective and <span class="companylink">First Round Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five ground stations will receive the Planet Labs imagery as the satellites pass overhead. Dr. Marshall would not disclose how often the satellites would pass the same spot. ''The point is that by putting up lots of satellites, we can image the whole Earth on a much more frequent basis,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skybox Imaging, in Mountain View, Calif., aims to provide sharply detailed images as well as high-definition video with its satellites. The company, which has raised about $91 million, expects to put its SkySat-1 and SkySat-2 satellites into orbit later this year, said Dan Berkenstock, a co-founder, and then follow with a group totaling 24 satellites. Customers will be able to buy images or an appliance to download information directly from the satellite. ''They can log onto our satellite and ask it to take pictures,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan Space Imaging, a subsidiary of the <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Corporation</span>, recently signed a contract with Skybox allowing it to directly downlink imagery for agricultural and maritime monitoring as well as for disaster response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microsatellite services promise a new, accessible way to monitor global changes such as crop growth, said Anthony Janetos, director of Boston University's Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future. ''You can't understand these forces if you can't measure them,'' he said. ''These services will be useful in gathering those measurements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new satellites are yet another stage in the expansion of the human view aided by powerful cameras and digital communication, said Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at <span class="companylink">New York University</span> and author of ''The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This change has pluses and minuses, he observed. People who try to build a private hideaway in the woods might come to realize that it isn't so private. But such images could also spot illegal logging in remote spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we can have a Godlike view, looking down from the heavens,'' he said. ''I can understand why people would be nervous. But the cameras can make the world more transparent and open. I'm for that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine taking a 10-story building, launching it, angling it so that it shifts 330 feet to the side as it rises 820 feet into the air – and then landing it on the same spot it started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is essentially what the rocket scientists at <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, the company commonly known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, did on Tuesday in their latest effort to develop a rocket that can be used again and again. Currently rockets are used just once, with the first stage disintegrating as it falls back to Earth. This bothers Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, who likens it to building a 747, flying it cross-country and then throwing it away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reusable rocket would make it less expensive to get to orbit, but generating the energy needed to lift off from Earth and accelerate to 17,500 miles per hour — the speed needed to stay in orbit — is a major challenge. NASA’s space shuttles partially solved that problem with reusable orbiters and rocket boosters, but the result was so complicated and fragile that it ended up costing more money than throwaway rockets would have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Grasshopper Rocket Test by Spacex, Aug. 13, 2013. Watch on YouTube.[http://youtube.com/embed/2t15vP1PyoA]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, on the first two flights of its Falcon 9 rocket, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> attempted to use parachutes to recover the first stage, without success. Mr. Musk then changed strategies. Instead of parachutes, the rocket engines on the first stage would fire again after separating from the second stage, and the first stage would fly back to the launching pad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To execute this strategy, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> built a test vehicle called the Grasshopper, which it started testing late last year, with each flight a bit higher and more challenging than the last. The latest flight demonstrated more pronounced steering maneuvers in moving to the side. The launching took place at <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>’s testing site in South Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was reminiscent of flights two decades ago of an earlier reusable spacecraft called the Delta Clipper Experimental, or DC-X, which was built by McDonnell Douglas. First financed by the defense department, for servicing of orbiting space weapons, and then by NASA, the DC-X made a dozen flights between 1993 and 1996. A landing strut failure and a fire on the last flight badly damaged the rocket, and NASA decided not to build another. Veterans from that program are gathering in New Mexico this weekend for a conference commemorating the 20th anniversary of the first DC-X flight.[http://dc-xspacequest.org/]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Delta Clipper Experimental Advanced (DCXA) Reusable Launch Vehicle Watch on YouTube.[http://youtube.com/embed/JzXcTFfV3Ls]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is still a long way from what it needs for a practical reusable rocket. On a Falcon 9 flight, the first stage separates at an altitude of about 50 miles, hundreds of miles from the launching pad while traveling thousands of miles per hour. The first stage would have to slow down, turn around, re-enter the lower atmosphere and retrace its trajectory before setting back down.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said Thursday that its celebrated planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft, which broke down in May when a reaction wheel that controls its pointing failed, could not be fixed and would never again search for planets around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing news brings to an end, for now, one phase of the most romantic of space dreams, the search for other Earths among the exoplanets of the Milky Way. NASA has already asked astronomers for ideas on how to use the hobbled spacecraft, whose telescope is in perfect shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as they mourned the end of Kepler, astronomers said its legacy would continue as they worked their way through a trove of data the spacecraft has gathered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last count, Kepler had discovered 3,548 possible planets, and 135 of them -- some smaller than the Earth -- have been validated by other observations, including earthbound telescopes. But hundreds or thousands more are in the pipeline, said William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., Kepler's originator and principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most exciting discoveries are going to come in the next few years as we search through this data,'' Mr. Borucki said on Thursday in a telephone news conference. ''In the next few years we're going to be able to answer the questions that inspired Kepler: Are Earthlike planets common or rare in the galaxy?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched into an orbit around the Sun in March 2009. Its official mission was to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that harbor Earthlike planets by carrying out a survey of some 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of their suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three dips, or transits, are considered the criteria for a planet candidate, which means the Earth or a planet in a similar orbit that was habitable would take three years to show up. Accordingly, Kepler was designed to operate for four years, but other sunlike stars turned out to be more jittery in their output than expected, making the detection of Earth analogues more difficult. Since astronomers could learn a lot more from Kepler if it went on collecting data, the decision was made last year to extend the spacecraft's mission for three more years, until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far Kepler's mission has cost $600 million, and its budget for the 2013 fiscal year is about $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its finds were a planet nicknamed Tatooine, after the ''Star Wars'' planet with two suns, otherwise known as Kepler 16b, the first one found that orbits two stars at once. Another was the so-called Styrofoam planet, which is again half as large as Jupiter but so puffed up by the heat of its star that it is only one-tenth as dense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest Kepler has come to finding another Earth was in April, when the team discovered a pair of planets about half again as big as the Earth orbiting a yellow star, now known as Kepler 62, that is 1,200 light years away. Both planets reside in the ''Goldilocks'' zone where temperatures should be lukewarm and suitable for liquid water and thus life as we imagine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, however, Kepler was already in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to do its job of precisely monitoring starlight, Kepler has to keep pointing accurately enough so that each star in the field of view stays on the same pixel in the detector, equivalent to pinpointing a soccer ball in Central Park as seen from San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels, essentially gyroscopes, of which three are needed to keep it pointed. Last summer, one wheel showed signs of too much friction and was shut down. A second wheel failed in May, putting the spacecraft into safe mode and jeopardizing the exoplanet search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers began to sing dirges. Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, dashed off a poem, which said, in part, ''Let jet airplanes circle at night overhead/ Sky-writing over Cygnus: Kepler is dead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers spent several months trying to resurrect Kepler's pointing ability. ''We had very little hope it was actually going to be recoverable,'' said Charles Sobeck, a Kepler deputy project manager, who compared the problem to a stuck wheel on a supermarket shopping cart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They managed to get both faulty reaction wheels spinning again, but with too much friction. Last week, when they tried to make the spacecraft point, it went into safe mode after a few hours, making it clear that Kepler's planet-hunting days were over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe they left no stone unturned,'' said Paul Hertz, NASA's director of astrophysics, in the news conference announcing the end of the rescue effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is now pondering ways in which the telescope can be used with two reaction wheels. In one mode, stars would drift across the detector ''like a lost nomadic tribe migrating across the Sahara,'' in the words of Dr. Marcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letters looking for ideas have gone out to astronomers, and NASA might eventually convene a review panel to consider future Kepler operations in competition with other science projects, Dr. Hertz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, astronomers continue to pore over the flood of data that is still in the Kepler pipeline. Mr. Borucki -- speaking with the relentless optimism of a man who spent 20 years getting Kepler designed, approved and into space -- said that Kepler could still perform its prime directive of measuring the frequency of Earthlike planets in the galaxy, albeit with poorer statistical certainty than he would have liked. It would take about three more years of data analysis, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going have to dig down hard to find those planets -- we know we can do it,'' Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he conceived the mission 20 years ago, he said, no one knew if there were any planets out there in the galaxy. ''Now at the completion,'' he said, ''we know our galaxy is filled to the brim with planets. When you look up at the sky and see it filled with stars, most of those stars have planets.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHROUDED by foliage and separated from the city by the Hudson River, the looming cliffs of the Palisades mean little more to most New Yorkers than a pleasant view from the West Side Highway. But these titanic ramparts of ancient basalt are also monuments to an apocalypse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cliffs were once underground channels of molten rock that fed widespread volcanic eruptions 200 million years ago as the supercontinent Pangaea pulled apart at the seams. The eruptions covered more than four million square miles with basalt lava and belched vast amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur into the atmosphere. Brief volcanic winters followed, but the eruptions also set off an ocean-acidifying, global-warming catastrophe that wiped out three-quarters of life on earth. This was the end-Triassic extinction, which cleared the way for the dinosaurs and their domination of the planet for the next 136 million years, before a giant asteroid struck Mexico and ended their reign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, a team of researchers from <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> and the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> published a paper in the journal Science connecting these eruptions -- which took place in four pulses over 600,000 years -- with this global near-death experience, one of five major extinctions over the last 540 million years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul E. Olsen, a paleontologist at Columbia and one of the study's co-authors, recently took me on a tour of the Palisades. Before we left, he showed me a fossil that he and his 12-year-old son found on a beach in Haverstraw, N.Y., along the Hudson -- the imprint of a clumsy-looking five-knuckled foot. It was made by a species of crocodilian reptile, a rauisuchian, the dominant predator before the volcanic cataclysm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can find fish and reptile fossils here by the hundreds, were the rock not so hard,'' he said as we hiked to a point up from the Ross Dock Picnic Area, just north of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J., where the base of the Palisades meets older sedimentary rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area was once part of a huge tropical rift valley created as the continent cleaved apart. The patterns of colors on these sedimentary rocks -- from black and thinly striated to red-brown -- are markers of an ancient lake that alternated from deep to shallow in 20,000-year cycles controlled by the wobble of the earth's axis and the amount of sunlight hitting the planet. Professor Olsen discovered that the first wave of the extinction happened within just a single sedimentary layer, in less than 20,000 years, as atmospheric carbon dioxide likely doubled from the eruptions, sending global temperatures soaring by 3 degrees Celsius or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We dodged a car rushing along a park road as we continued our hike. Behind us, through a thicket of bittersweet and porcelainberry, I spotted the outline of New York City. We're living in the Anthropocene, the newly named geologic epoch dominated by man. The city is a churning symbol of this new age, a metabolic node of the human superorganism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists believe we are now in the midst of another great extinction, driven not by natural events but by the activities of man: hunting, habitat destruction, the introduction of invasive species and pollution, which has drastically altered the thin glaze of life-supporting chemistry that coats the earth. By some estimates, perhaps close to 30,000 species of plants and animals go extinct every year. Whole ecosystems, like coral reefs, which went virtually extinct in the end-Triassic extinction, are now facing worldwide collapse again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> report last fall warned that ''present emission trends put the world plausibly on a path toward 4 degrees Celsius warming within the century.'' The surface waters of the carbon-dioxide absorbing oceans have already become 30 percent more acidic since the start of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In terms of global warming and ocean acidification,'' Professor Olsen said, the rate of change during the end-Triassic extinction ''was comparable to what we're doing today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I looked up the cliffs I wondered what we would leave to the ages. If catastrophe strikes, would future geologists find evidence of New York, a marker for our time, just as the Palisades have survived as a tombstone for another era?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' he said. ''It would be eroded away fairly quickly.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Man-made perils to the universe’s garden of life are evident from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1961, Yuri A. Gagarin, the first man to orbit the Earth, issued his initial impressions from an altitude of more than 100 miles. The sky was deep black, he said, and the Earth’s horizon crowned with “a beautiful blue halo.” Between bright white clouds, he enthused, he could make out “snow, forest, mountains.” It was an Edenic picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the subsequent depths of the cold war, with nuclear weapons racing off the assembly lines of the Soviet Union and the United States, succeeding cosmonauts and astronauts contributed their own observations. Like Mr. Gagarin, they found their world mesmerizingly beautiful. They also reported a singularly intriguing fact: no borders or political boundaries could be seen from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, few signs of humanity were visible, at least on the sunlit side. Sure, Los Angeles was visibly smoggy. And irrigated cropland could sometimes be discerned, like pointillism on Nile Delta sand. But these were exceptions. Under a startlingly thin layer of atmosphere, vast expanses of desert ceded to forests that gave way to the oceans that make up 70 percent of Earth’s surface. The planet seemed largely untouched. Only at night, when jewel-like cities rotated into view, did clear signs of civilization emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was something profoundly reassuring about this. Even as the ICBMs slept, it was heartening to know that despite our best efforts, we had not yet banged up the biosphere enough to make the effects easily visible from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those were the 1960s and early ’70s; the global population was half what it is today, and the portion driving cars and leaving the lights on was far lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrast that with the last decade or so, when astronauts and Earth-observing satellites have recorded a different, deeply unsettling picture. While our world remains ravishingly beautiful, it increasingly shows symptoms of distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these indicators are the direct result of human activity. Others are the indirect consequence of using our atmosphere as a dumping ground for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a dispassionate quality to the view from on high. On Aug. 2, 2005, the circuitous trajectory of Messenger, a NASA spacecraft, brought it boomeranging back toward Earth on its way to explore Mercury. Its steady stream of data offered a rare chance to watch our world grow larger in space, as a visitor from another star system might first see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, Earth was simply a pearl of milky white and ultramarine blue, with the white — clouds, ice and snow — being other forms of life-giving water. Eventually, hues of tawny gold appeared; more than a third of the visible land area, it seemed, was desert. Only later, when the planet filled half the picture plane, did a hint of emerald emerge between the clouds. A verdant, compelling green. The color of photosynthesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After this first direct evidence of life on Earth, and with the spacecraft still a quarter of the distance to the Moon, another hue emerged. Above the lush equatorial belt of South America, lower in altitude and distinct from the clouds, it was a nebulous, smoky, profoundly unsettling gray-blue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could this be from fires, perhaps willfully set? Could this first hint of intelligent life on Earth signify a species evidently busy creating still more desert?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You already know the answer. August is the driest month in the Amazon River basin — the best time for subsistence farmers and owners of large tracts of land to clear acreage for agriculture by burning off forests that sequester carbon dioxide and replenish oxygen in our overcarbonized atmosphere. Although the deforestation rate in Brazil has slowed since 2005, it never stopped entirely and may be rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, much the same is happening in that other remaining repository of invaluable equatorial forest, Indonesia — particularly on the island of Sumatra, where similar glimpses show jungle being burned off annually to clear land for palm oil production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this was the view from some 65,000 miles away. Far closer in, NASA maintains a small fleet of Earth-observing satellites. Unfortunately, their visual record makes it even clearer that something is going badly wrong in the garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the world, tremendous wildfires can be seen raging during the searing summers of the new millennium. As the oceans warm, vast equatorial hurricanes have smashed North America. In Canada, the Northwest Passage has twice become clear of ice during the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the smog is no longer localized. A gunmetal exhalation of coal and fuel smoke blankets China almost daily, extending out across the sea toward the Korean Peninsula, Japan and beyond. We are tracking glaciers retreating, and immense polar icebergs calving into rising waters. Gargantuan sandstorms extend out from expanding deserts, sometimes traversing the breadth of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the images from NASA’s flagship Terra and Aqua satellites are downright heartbreaking. They seem to make the case that we’re inexplicably intent on engineering our own expulsion from the garden, in a kind of late-breaking, self-inflicted Old Testament dismissal. But as five decades of space exploration make clear, there are no other worlds even remotely suitable for human life — at least not in this solar system. We simply have no other place to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mid-Pliocene epoch, some three million years ago, was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide was at the levels we are now approaching; some scientists estimate that mid-latitude temperatures then were between 16 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than today, and sea levels may have been up to 115 feet higher. In our own era in the 48 contiguous states, according to the <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 7 of the 10 warmest years since 1901 have occurred since 1998. Welcome to the Anthropocene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama’s speech in June, promising action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was welcome, if belated. It may be the best he can do domestically. But nobody pretends it is adequate to the onrushing disaster. Having dodged the bullet of cold war nuclear annihilation, we face a new threat just as global, man-made and potentially lethal. A sense of emergency is what is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama should invite world leaders to an emergency conclave in Washington as early as possible and challenge China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and other major greenhouse-gas emitters to equal or exceed the percentage reductions he seeks for the United States. He should also try to rally the nation and globe in support of an international Manhattan Project, in which the best scientific minds would devise carbon-sequestration technologies that could clean the air of the heating elements we’ve put there — rather than simply seeking to limit the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having constructed a civilization capable of observing our still paradisiacal world from objectivity-inducing distances, we need to set aside our squabbles, recognize that we face a species-wide threat, and use our scientific-technical genius to protect the only known home of life in the universe.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDOur theme this week is things that move in unexpected ways. In Texas, a rocket flew 800 feet in the air, then traveled sideways for 300 feet before returning to Earth. Elsewhere, two teams of researchers devised a method for teleporting small bits of information. And a wounded $600 million telescope is like a shopping cart with a broken wheel, says NASA. Onward and upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering: A Reusable Rocket</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of space travel is littered with disposable rockets. But the scientists at <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, better known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, have been working to develop one that can land safely and then be used again. In its latest test run, a 10-story rocket known as the Grasshopper lifted off and briefly flew sideways, then landed smoothly on the spot from which it came, remaining upright throughout. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is still a long way from producing a practical reusable rocket, but the one-minute flight represented a significant step forward, and made for the week's coolest science video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space: Big, Fussy Eater</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an enormous black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and, given its size, scientists have long wondered why it doesn't grow faster and consume more than it does. Now, radio astronomers have discovered an elderly, rapidly rotating star known as a pulsar in the vicinity of the black hole, called Sagittarius A, that is providing some clues, reported Nature. By observing the pulsar's behavior, researchers have deduced that Sagittarius A generates a surprisingly strong magnetic field that may slow its intake of stellar material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biology: An Evolutionary Tail</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evolution isn't supposed to be predictable. But a common, single-tailed microbe, left alone to feed on sugar, consistently produced future generations with multiple tails that were better suited to eating and reproducing. The experiment, conducted by Joao Xavier of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, not only defies conventional wisdom, it suggests a path for disease research. The microbe in question can cause infections in the lungs, and clues to its behavior could help counter its natural defenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physics: Quantum Leap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two teams of physicists have successfully teleported tiny bits of information from one side of a computer chip to the other, reported National Geographic. The process involved two quantum bits, one on the sender side of the chip, and one on the receiving end. Because the bits were ''entangled,'' to use a quantum physics term, what happened to one happened to the other. So when data was written to the sender side of the chip, it would leap to the receiving side without passing through the space between. The research could potentially improve computing and encryption speeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment: A Familiar Thaw</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet may be following a familiar pattern, says a study published in Nature. The middle of West Antarctica has warmed by about 4.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1958, but East Antarctica has warmed barely at all. The study, based on new ice records, suggests that the same pattern played out during the thaw from Earth's last big ice age. The ice sheet over West Antarctica started heating up 20,000 to 22,000 years ago, earlier than previously thought. But East Antarctica, which was higher and colder, was in a deep freeze until 18,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming Up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomy: New Careers in Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is asking astronomers to help it find a new mission for Kepler, the celebrated spacecraft that broke down in May when a wheel that controls its telescope failed. Launched in 2009, Kepler collected a trove of data as it searched for Earthlike planets across the galaxy. That data will keep researchers busy for years, but without that wheel, the telescope is just too wobbly for its intended mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 23, 2013, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A report in The Week column on Tuesday about physicists' successfully teleporting tiny bits of information misstated, at one point, the distance the information, known as quantum bits, traveled. As the report correctly noted elsewhere, the information traveled from one side of a computer chip to the other -- not from one computer chip to another.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An international panel of scientists has found with near certainty that human activity is the cause of most of the temperature increases of recent decades, and warns that sea levels could conceivably rise by more than three feet by the end of the century if emissions continue at a runaway pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists, whose findings are reported in a draft summary of the next big United Nations climate report, largely dismiss a recent slowdown in the pace of warming, which is often cited by climate change doubters, attributing it most likely to short-term factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report emphasizes that the basic facts about future climate change are more established than ever, justifying the rise in global concern. It also reiterates that the consequences of escalating emissions are likely to be profound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010,'' the draft report says. ''There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draft comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of several hundred scientists that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, along with Al Gore. Its summaries, published every five or six years, are considered the definitive assessment of the risks of climate change, and they influence the actions of governments around the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions, for instance, largely on the basis of the group's findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming report will be the fifth major assessment from the group, created in 1988. Each report has found greater certainty that the planet is warming and greater likelihood that humans are the primary cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2007 report found ''unequivocal'' evidence of warming, but hedged a little on responsibility, saying the chances were at least 90 percent that human activities were the cause. The language in the new draft is stronger, saying the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the principal cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On sea level, which is one of the biggest single worries about climate change, the new report goes well beyond the assessment published in 2007, which largely sidestepped the question of how much the ocean could rise this century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report also reiterates a core difficulty that has plagued climate science for decades: While averages for such measures as temperature can be predicted with some confidence on a global scale, the coming changes still cannot be forecast reliably on a local scale. That leaves governments and businesses fumbling in the dark as they try to plan ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another closely watched issue, the scientists retreated slightly from their 2007 position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the question of how much the planet could warm if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere doubled, the previous report largely ruled out any number below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The new draft says the rise could be as low as 2.7 degrees, essentially restoring a scientific consensus that prevailed from 1979 to 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the draft says only that the low number is possible, not that it is likely. Many climate scientists see only a remote chance that the warming will be that low, with the published evidence suggesting that an increase above 5 degrees Fahrenheit is more likely if carbon dioxide doubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is up 41 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and if present trends continue it could double in a matter of decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warming the entire planet by 5 degrees Fahrenheit would add a stupendous amount of energy to the climate system. Scientists say the increase would be greater over land and might exceed 10 degrees at the poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They add that such an increase would lead to widespread melting of land ice, extreme heat waves, difficulty growing food and massive changes in plant and animal life, probably including a wave of extinctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new document is not final and will not become so until an intensive, closed-door negotiating session among scientists and government leaders in Stockholm in late September. But if the past is any guide, most of the core findings of the document will survive that final review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The document was leaked over the weekend after it was sent to a large group of people who had signed up to review it. It was first reported on in detail by the Reuters news agency, and The New York Times obtained a copy independently to verify its contents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does no original research, but instead periodically assesses and summarizes the published scientific literature on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draft document ''is likely to change in response to comments from governments received in recent weeks and will also be considered by governments and scientists at a four-day approval session at the end of September,'' the panel's spokesman, Jonathan Lynn, said in a statement Monday. ''It is therefore premature and could be misleading to attempt to draw conclusions from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After winning the Nobel Peace Prize six years ago, the group became a political target for climate doubters, who helped identify minor errors in the 2007 report. This time, the panel adopted rigorous procedures in the hope of preventing such mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some climate doubters challenge the idea that the earth is warming at all; others concede that it is, but deny human responsibility; still others acknowledge a human role, but assert that the warming is likely to be limited and the impacts manageable. Every major scientific academy in the world has warned that global warming is a serious problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel shifted to a wider range for the potential warming, dropping the plausible low end to 2.7 degrees, after a wave of recent studies saying higher estimates were unlikely. But those studies are contested, and scientists at Stockholm are likely to debate whether to stick with that language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said he feared the intergovernmental panel, in writing its draft, had been influenced by criticism from climate doubters, who advocate even lower numbers. ''I think the I.P.C.C. on this point has once again erred on the side of understating the degree of the likely changes,'' Dr. Mann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Christopher B. Field, a researcher at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution for Science</span> who serves on the panel but was not directly involved in the new draft, said the group had to reflect the full range of plausible scientific views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that the I.P.C.C. has a tradition of being very conservative,'' Dr. Field said. ''They really want the story to be right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the likely rise in sea level over the coming century, the new report lays out several possibilities. In the most optimistic, the world's governments would prove far more successful at getting emissions under control than they have been in the recent past, helping to limit the total warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that circumstance, sea level could be expected to rise as little as 10 inches by the end of the century, the report found. That is a bit more than the eight-inch increase in the 20th century, which proved manageable even though it caused severe erosion along the world's shorelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other extreme, the report considers a chain of events in which emissions continue to increase at a swift pace. Under those conditions, sea level could be expected to rise at least 21 inches by 2100 and might increase a bit more than three feet, the draft report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of millions of people live near sea level, and either figure would represent a challenge for humanity, scientists say. But a three-foot rise in particular would endanger many of the world's great cities -- among them New York; London; Shanghai; Venice; Sydney, Australia; Miami; and New Orleans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, which would you rather do: Capture an asteroid or go back to the moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is one of the many interesting issues facing Congress that we probably will not have time to debate once Congress actually comes back next month. Then it'll be nothing but Obamacare and government shutdowns and the occasional discussion about whether Senator Ted Cruz has managed to dispose of his recently discovered dual Canadian citizenship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which I am personally looking forward to a lot. But today let's consider the American space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space exploration is one of the extremely few areas in which there is a lot of bipartisan agreement in Washington. For instance, both parties believe that the United States should be trying to get to Mars. Eventually. Nobody thinks this will happen anytime soon -- partly because the technology is so challenging and partly because Congress keeps cutting the space budget. So far, NASA has not shown any interest in the tactic being used by a Dutch company that hopes to establish a Martian colony in about 10 years, with money that would come in part from producing a reality series, somewhere along the lines of ''Big Brother" or perhaps ''Real Housewives of the Red Planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third point of wide bipartisan agreement is that nobody wants their constituents to be clobbered by an asteroid. Really, this is a priority. The Obama administration is currently promoting an ''asteroid grand challenge,'' in which we're invited ''to find all asteroid threats to human populations'' and figure out what to do about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And -- this is good news, people -- we've already pinpointed about 95 percent of all the rocks in the solar system that are of planet-mashing size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know that you are now instantly focusing on the remaining 5 percent, as well as the multitudinous smaller fellows that are capable of taking out Massachusetts or Paris -- or your local shopping center. Everybody is in favor of finding them too, particularly since one grazed Russia earlier this year, causing the House Science Committee to hold a special Threats From Space meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even members of Congress who pooh-pooh the peril of global warming believe in the danger of global asteroid-exploding. I am thinking about Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads -- yes! -- the House Science Committee. And Sen. Ted Cruz, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Subcommittee on Science and Space, who demanded that we ''do what needs to be done'' to prevent an asteroid from hitting the earth and smashing into a major American city. Or a Canadian one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all this cheerleading, there hasn't been all that much money spent on the mission. Discover magazine estimated that over the past 15 years, the United States had spent less money on asteroid detection ''than the production budget of the 1998 asteroid movie 'Armageddon.' '' In which Ben Affleck won Liv Tyler but the earth lost Shanghai, much of New York and Bruce Willis. But we were talking about capturing asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is what NASA should do during the really, really long pre-Mars interlude. The White House wants to send an unmanned spacecraft to capture a smallish asteroid, tow it back and put it into orbit around the moon, where we could send astronauts to study it. This would most definitely help us in the race to develop the best ''capture bag,'' and there's pretty wide agreement we would acquire some other useful technology as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This would be the first time humans have, in some sense, rearranged the solar system for their own purposes. So that's exciting,'' said Prof. Tom Prince, director of the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not as far as the House of Representatives is concerned. The Science Committee recently voted to cut all the money for asteroid capture and invest it instead in a new moon landing. There were several objections to the Obama plan, the main one being that it was kind of boring. ''Costly and uninspiring,'' sniffed Chairman Smith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House position was that if you wanted to talk about boring, look at a moon landing. ''Going back to the moon, something we have done six times, just does not seem to us worth the investment,'' said Lori Garver, NASA deputy administrator, in a phone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And anyway, what about protecting the earth from a killer asteroid? I believe I speak for all of us when I say that space exploration is good, but not being hit by a large hunk of galactic rock is even better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House Republicans could have a point. The asteroid that NASA wants to capture would be way smaller than Killer Visitor dimensions. Although it does seem a little peculiar that they're calling for a dramatic moon-colony initiative at the same time they're cutting the space budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also conceivable that the Science Committee doesn't like the Obama plan because it's the Obama plan. This has been known to happen in the House. Perhaps we should be grateful it hasn't voted to cancel the asteroid-capturing program 40 times.</p>

Unlike many other clams, though, it can move on its own by lifting its shell over its body and sliding along the ocean bottom.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''bog body'' found in Ireland in 2011 -- one of more than 100 mummified remains that have been found in bogs around the world -- has now been dated with radiocarbon tests to 2000 B.C., The Irish Times reported. It is the oldest body ever discovered in Europe with the skin still intact. The young adult male, found in the Cul Na Mona Bog in Cashel, County Laois, probably met a violent end, possibly in a ritual sacrifice. He had a broken arm and there were cuts in his back apparently inflicted with a knife. Scientists plan to analyze the contents of the man's stomach to determine his diet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoologists have discovered a new species of clam on the Pacific Coast that lives on the spines of sea urchins. Its shell is thin and fragile, and the animal is about 2/10 of an inch across. Called Waldo arthuri, it, like most clams, is a hermaphrodite. Unlike many other clams, though, it can move on its own by lifting its shell over its body and sliding along the ocean bottom. Scientists think it snuggles up to sea urchins for protection, but they are not sure what the sea urchins get out of this intimate relationship they told National Geographic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- China plans to land an unmanned exploratory rover on the moon by the end of 2013, a step forward in the country's efforts to master the skills of space travel, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching rocket and other components for the Chang'e-3 lunar probe, named after a goddess in Chinese mythology who flew to the moon, have already been assembled and tested, Xinhua reported, citing a meeting of the Chinese lunar exploration program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chang'e-3 mission will be our country's first soft landing on an extraterrestrial body,'' said the head of the lunar exploration program, Ma Xingrui, according to Xinhua. ''The technology is complicated and extremely difficult, with huge risks and great responsibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission will build on China's two previous Chang'e lunar exploration efforts: a craft launched in 2007 that orbited the moon, and another launched in 2010 that did the same and then embarked on deep-space exploration and tests. Chinese space engineers have also speculated about eventually attempting a manned mission to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China sees establishing a long-term presence in space as an important part of its emergence as a global power. This year, it sent three Chinese astronauts into orbit for a 15-day mission that included exercises in docking, an important skill needed to build and maintain a manned space station. China first sent an astronaut into space in 2003. The latest report did not give a specific date for the Chang'e-3 launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States, which landed astronauts on the moon starting in 1969, plans to launch its latest lunar probe on Sept. 6. The unmanned probe is meant to study lunar dust.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VENICE -- It is difficult to imagine a better use of 3D than in Alfonso Cuarón's ''Gravity,'' which opened the Venice Film Festival this year not just with a bang, but with a considerable quantity of space debris that the audience found hurtling toward them with alarming verisimilitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The out-of-competition film shown on Wednesday night stars Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone, a medical researcher, and George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky, a veteran astronaut on his last mission. They are on a routine space walk to repair the Hubble Telescope when, minutes into the film, an exploding Russian satellite sets off the space equivalent of a multicar pile-up. It shreds their shuttle craft and the telescope, leaving them floating in space several hundred miles above Earth, with only each other for company and a rapidly diminishing supply of oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie, scripted by Mr. Cuarón and his son Jonás, immediately sets the audience on edge -- you wonder not just how are they going to survive, but how are they going to manage to sustain this drama over an hour and a half. Yet sustain it they do, to dazzling effect. It is difficult to give more plot details without revealing any of the twists and turns of this gripping and visually stunning drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gravity'' is a surprising hybrid, a sci-fi disaster movie, but an intimate one. It has balletic qualities that go way beyond Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' with which it will inevitably be compared. The pyrotechnic effects in this movie could only have been achieved with the latest digital tools, but the Cuaróns' film remains a story that is centered on character and human emotions. It also has memorable moments of poetry -- a shimmering detached tear-drop traveling through space, for example -- and humor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bullock's performance is a bravura demonstration of ''grace under pressure,'' in a role that was clearly physically and mentally demanding. Her character has suffered a personal tragedy, but faced with the seemingly impossible challenge of maintaining her life she finds new untapped sources of strength and determination. She said at a news conference that while researching the part she had been in regular contact with astronauts on the International Space Station. One shudders to think of the size of her telephone bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Curran's in-competition ''Tracks'' also has a female lead and is firmly rooted in a study of character. The film is based on the true story of the Australian Robyn Davidson, who in 1975 set out alone on a 2,700-kilometer, or 1,700-mile, journey through one of the most hostile environments on Earth, from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean, with three camels and her Labrador. Dissatisfied with the lack of purpose and direction in her life in the city, this daring enterprise was a quest of a very private nature, and she was taken aback when her exploit became world news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In refreshing contrast to today's celebrity-seeking culture, she had severe misgivings about agreeing to let the National Geographic photographer Rick Smolan (played by Adam Driver) meet her at several stages along the route to record her progress in exchange for the sponsorship without which she could not have made the trip. The account she was subsequently encouraged to write became a worldwide best seller and a staple in Australian schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has long been talk of turning this modern Australian epic into a movie, but it has taken nearly 40 years to bring it to the big screen. In fact, so much time has elapsed that the movie records some aspects of Australian and Aboriginal life that have since changed considerably. It is also something of a nostalgic document of a pre-GPS era -- when disappearing into the wilderness for weeks on end was still possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although born in the United States, Mr. Curran spent many years in Australia and made his first film there. He shot it in the Outback, often in arduous circumstances, and Mandy Walker's cinematogaphy, using a special 35-millimeter film, does full justice to the continent's awe-inspiring desertscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian Mia Wasikowska is perfectly cast as Ms. Davidson and plays the remarkable adventurer with skill, conviction and sensitivity. There is, too, a splendid cameo performance by Rolley Mintuma as an Aboriginal elder who guided and befriended Ms. Davidson on one of the most hazardous parts of her journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10th edition of the Venice Days sidebar category got off to a strong start with the screening of Yuri Adler's ''Bethlehem,'' in Arabic and Hebrew and co-scripted with Ali Waked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this thriller set in Jerusalem and the West Bank, Razi (Tsahi Halevy) is an Israeli police agent who has managed to recruit a young Arab boy, Sanfur (Shadi Mar'i), as an informant in Bethlehem. Sanfur's older brother, Abu Ibrahim (Tarek Copti), has become a militant high up on the Israelis' hit list, and Razi and his colleagues now seem on the verge of being able to use Sanfur to entrap and assassinate him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an almost paternal bond has grown up between Sanfur and Razi, which Razi's boss becomes increasingly worried might sabotage the ambush that is intended to prevent Ibrahim from carrying out another deadly attack in Jerusalem. The murky world of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and the vicious circle of suspicion and betrayal in which all the players are locked, are well drawn in this gritty, suspenseful drama as the action moves toward its inevitably violent denouement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first of three Italian films to be shown in competition was Emma Dante's ''Via Castellana Bandiera'' (A Street in Palermo). In this adaptation of her own novel, Ms. Dante herself plays one of the leading roles as Rosa, a Palermo native, who, much against her better judgement, has returned to the Sicilian city with her partner, Clara (Alba Rohrwacher), for a wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They take a wrong turn and find themselves in a narrow street in a poor neighborhood head-to-head with a beat-up vehicle driven by an evidently batty old woman, Samira (Lena Cotta). She is driving her extended, noisy -- and disappointingly stereotypical -- Sicilian family home from the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Rosa nor Samira will back down and the stand-off soon takes on ludicrous (and implausible) proportions as day turns into night and the neighbors start betting on which of the women will be the first to throw in the towel. Unfortunately, the filmmaker seems to have little more of an idea of how to extract herself from this impasse than the characters she has created.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe last moon mission on NASA's current schedule -- a small, unmanned spacecraft that will study moon dust and the lunar atmosphere -- is scheduled to launch on Friday from Wallops Island, Va., elating scientists who study the moon but highlighting political questions about what NASA should do next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Smart Car-size spacecraft, which NASA calls the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer, will take 30 days to get into orbit around the moon, spend the next 30 days checking its equipment and proceed with scientific work for 100 days, searching for water molecules in the atmosphere and gathering data about the curious substance known as lunar dust. Then the probe, which goes by the acronym Ladee (pronounced laddie), will take a death plunge into the rocky surface of the subject it is studying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the scientific program could be helpful in preparing for future manned missions to the moon. Although NASA currently does not have such plans, some members of Congress have called on the space agency to return to the moon rather than pursuing its current space objectives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there is wide agreement that NASA should ultimately aim for a manned flight to Mars, that goal is far off. The more immediate plan, which has been criticized on Capitol Hill, is to capture an asteroid and tow it closer to home so astronauts can visit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA has continued sending unmanned spacecraft to the moon; the coming mission will be the third to go there in five years. While scientists are excited about what the experiment may yield, they are also concerned about the absence of future moon voyages on NASA's schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to fly this mission with the goal of understanding the atmosphere and how dust might affect future human missions, and you don't have the future human missions, then part of the reason for the mission disappears,'' said David Kring, senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, a NASA-financed research institute in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if NASA sits on the sidelines, traffic to the moon will be busy. China announced last week that it would land its first exploratory rover on the moon by the end of the year. India, Japan, Russia and the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> also have unmanned missions in the works. And <span class="companylink">Google</span> is sponsoring a competition called the Lunar X Prize, offering up to $20 million to the first company that can send a robotic spacecraft to the moon by 2015 and make it perform certain tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ladee spacecraft was conceived when NASA was also planning new manned missions to the moon, which would have been the first since 1972. But the Obama administration canceled that program, called Constellation, in 2010, calling it over budget and behind schedule. Ladee stayed in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will search for water in the very thin lunar atmosphere, which is estimated to be one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, perhaps similar to Mercury's. Scientists want to find out how the ice on the moon's poles managed to get there, said Richard Elphic, project scientist for the mission. They speculate that water molecules in the moon's atmosphere may have migrated toward the poles and frozen in place, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of water below the moon's surface was discovered in recent years by a NASA-financed instrument aboard an Indian spacecraft, Chandrayaan-1. Data collected from the coming mission could help complete the picture of the moon's water cycle, Dr. Elphic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter will also examine the movements of lunar dust. ''Dust'' is a bit of a misnomer, the scientists said: the crushed debris is extremely fine but also has jagged, sharp edges, since there is no wind or water on the moon's surface to wear it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly more annoying than terrestrial dust,'' said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission. ''It's like shards of glass, and it sticks to everything. If it gets into your eyes or your skin, it's abrasive and it hurts. It also really gums up machinery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dust poses a risk to robots and humans alike, as it can wreak havoc on equipment and spacesuits. Understanding the way the dust moves through the atmosphere will help scientists better prepare for longer missions on the moon, Dr. Elphic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone agrees that dust is a major concern. ''Dust on the lunar surface does not pose a serious risk to future lunar exploration,'' Dr. Kring said, pointing out that astronauts managed to survive the dust without major problems. But he still saw value in the dust inquiry, saying, ''We always want to reduce the risk, and to understand the dust phenomenon in and of itself is worthwhile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said the launching would break technological ground. Previously, spacecraft were custom-made for each mission and the models were not reusable. But this spacecraft was designed for assembly-line production, so that future missions could save money by using identical components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft's design and construction cost $125 million out of a mission price of $250 million, said Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman. If the same design were used again, Mr. Brown said, NASA estimates that the cost would drop to $90 million for the first spacecraft and then over time to $55 million each. At the moment, though, NASA does not have other projects lined up to reuse the model, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will ride on the maiden voyage of the Minotaur V rocket built by the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, one of several private contractors NASA has turned to in recent years to supply rockets for its missions.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though many think the Moon does not have an atmosphere, that is not quite true. There is an atmosphere, but it is extremely thin -- and NASA is spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars to study it with a spacecraft launched on Friday. Back on Earth, scientists reported that global warming was changing not just the climate but the weather, intensifying at least some of last year's extreme weather events.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising global warming, propelled in part by carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels, is expected to shake up the weather, and that is exactly what happened last year, climate scientists reported last week. In examining a dozen extreme weather events last year, scientists found signs that human activity contributed to about half of them. One of the most robust results was a much greater likelihood of heat waves like the one in the United States in July 2012. On the other hand, computer simulations indicated that the higher levels of carbon dioxide did not increase the odds of droughts like the one that affected much of the Midwest. In that case, the scientists said, it was just part of the natural cycles of weather.</p>

Trillions of microbes live in the intestines of a healthy person, helping to digest foods. Researchers found pairs of human twins in which one was obese and the other was thin. They extracted gut bacteria from each of the twins and then injected them into the guts of laboratory mice. Mice with bacteria from a fat twin grew fat. Mice with bacteria from a thin twin stayed lean. Researchers said that they wanted to figure out which particular bacteria induced thinness, and those perhaps could be used in the future as a treatment for obesity. Also intriguing was that a change in diet could cause bacteria from a thin twin to crowd out the bacteria from a fat twin, causing the fat mouse to lose weight. But the opposite never occurred.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its latest Moon mission, NASA launched an unmanned spacecraft that will study the evanescent atmosphere and dust particles above the surface. The craft, the Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer, or Ladee, is in orbit around Earth as engineers check that everything is working; it heads for the Moon in about a month. During the 100-day science part of the mission, Ladee will look for water and other molecules in the atmosphere. Scientists are interested in how dust is lifted off the lunar surface and moved about.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next video game craze could be for grandparents. Cognitive scientists have found that a simple game that forced players to juggle two different tasks helped improve the short-term memory and long-term focus of older adults. Researchers said those as old as 80 began to show neurological patterns of people in their 20s. The improvements persisted in other cognitive tasks after they finished playing. In the game, players drive around cars while trying to identify road signs that pop up. The research could lead to neurological interventions to improve memory and attention.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edinburgh</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid light pollution and bad weather, professional astronomers have to be prepared to travel long distances to use telescopes on mountaintops far away from towns or cities. Astronomers from Britain, which is not generally well known for its clear skies, are particularly used to traveling. When I was an astronomer in the 1990s, working at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh and at <span class="companylink">Imperial College London</span>, I made regular trips to observatories around the world, especially in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back home, all I could usually see were a few lonely stars fighting against the clouds lit up by a flat dull wash of reflected streetlight. Looking up from the Andes was a fundamentally different experience — the sky was so bright with stars that there were scarcely any dark gaps between them. To make the experience even more striking, in the Southern Hemisphere you can see phenomena like the Magellanic Clouds, the crowded heart of the Milky Way and the jewel-like constellation of the Southern Cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was studying quasars, some of the most distant known objects in the universe, which are understood to be the bright centers of galaxies containing supermassive black holes. At a superficial glance, quasars don’t look particularly interesting. All you can see is a starlike point of light, because the extraordinarily bright center dwarfs the rest of the galaxy. But detailed measurements of quasars reveal their vast distances and the amazingly high speeds of the gases that spin around the invisible black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I first went to Chile’s Atacama Desert, in 1990 — the year Augusto Pinochet finally stepped down after nearly 16 years in power — I found that the terrestrial landscape was almost as extraordinary as the objects I studied in the sky. In some parts of the desert it rains only once every few years. During the day there is nothing to see but rocks and sand and the dazzling sunlight reflected from distant telescope domes at the other observatories around the mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this time, astronomy was on the cusp of changing technologies. I was accustomed to using old-fashioned glass photographic plates — 13 inches across and thin enough to be curved into the focal plane of the telescope. The light of stars was caught in the photographic emulsion on the plates, and the resulting complicated shapes of galaxies reminded me of insects preserved in amber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this sort of photography was dying out and being superseded by C.C.D.’s — electronic devices that created virtual images of the sky, and the precursors to today’s digital cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So instead of fitting the plates into the telescope by hand while gazing out at the sky, observing in Chile meant sitting in a control room and operating the telescope remotely. Resulting images were displayed on computer screens. We saw the telescope only at the beginning of the night, when we were setting up, and at the end, when we shut everything down as the sun rose. During the night we didn’t even see the sky, because the control room — with its banks of computers that made it look like a low-rent Starship Enterprise — had no windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few nights of this work, everything, not just my quasars, started to feel remote. The objects on the screen reminded me of ghosts, with no substance to them. Going outside helped somewhat, the stars looked so large and real I felt I could reach out and grab them, but in contrast the landscape was so empty I might as well have been on the moon. There was nothing to pull me back to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I used to remind myself that I was there to work, and nothing more. But I would long for the complexities of life, tedious British rain and the screech of sea gulls, even traffic jams started to have a certain nostalgic charm. As I sat in the control room, I would reread old newspapers, trying to keep faith with the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at that, I did not succeed. I know now that the desert wasn’t empty, that it had a terrible secret; further north of the observatory, in an even more remote part of the Andes, was an abandoned prison camp set up during the Pinochet regime, called Chacabuco. This was a place where political opponents of the regime were sent in the 1970s. Sometimes they died there. As the celebrated 2010 Chilean documentary “Nostalgia for the Light” shows, their relatives are still searching the desert for their remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our telescopes had the power to detect candle flames many miles away, not to mention galaxies billions of light years away. And yet they never turned toward the camp. They weren’t built to do that sort of observation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And nor were we. The observatory that I visited in Chile is part of the <span class="companylink">European Southern Observatory</span>. It’s one of the largest in the world and was first conceived of not long after World War II, partly as a way of bringing together former enemies and encouraging peaceful scientific endeavors. But our only political contribution was neutrality: we were supposed to keep our heads down and get on with our work. When I arrived, we were advised not to talk about politics with people in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I left the world of professional astronomy some time ago. In the years since, I have often thought of how astronomy is seen as a benign, unbiased science. Its sole function is to increase our understanding of how the universe works: astronomers receive and record, but they do not experiment or perturb. They are not tainted by any application to, say, energy development or military technologies. Astronomy is, essentially, a passive science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember realizing when I was a student that I could make a measurement of an object in the sky, and how extraordinary that felt to me, as if it were a way of reaching out and connecting with something so far away. But maybe I found distant galaxies easier to understand than the people around me, and I wonder if my work became a substitute for any true connection. I still look to the edge of the universe, but I try to remember always to keep one eye focused here on earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW DELHI -- Leaving no room for extraterrestrials to have false hopes, the motto of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span> is very specific: ''In The Service Of Human Kind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November will mark 50 years since India sent a rocket into space for the very first time, a research projectile that was launched from a quiet fishing village in southern India, terrifying many who prayed for pardon from their gods as they watched the orange vapor trail of the <span class="companylink">Nike</span>-Apache rocket climbing to an altitude of about 200 kilometers, or 125 miles. If everything goes according to plan, in November, as if in tribute to the origins of its space program, India will send a mission to Mars that will orbit the Red Planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stated objectives of the 4.5 billion rupee, or $70 million, mission are to ascertain whether India can indeed send a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, and to study the planet's atmosphere and geology so that India could one day mine Mars and even send willing Indians there. And, of course, to detect evidence of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its very beginning, India's space program has attracted two extreme reactions -- that it is an important and honorable pursuit, which should make every Indian fiercely proud; and that it is a wasteful expenditure in a country where children die of starvation, a poor nation trying to compensate for its sense of smallness by assuming a phony machismo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, India's best-known cartoonist, R.K. Laxman, showed an average Indian being introduced to American space scientists as the best candidate to be sent to the moon. ''This is our man!'' the caption read. ''He can survive without water, food, light, air, shelter. ... ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That cartoon is not entirely irrelevant today, even as India is working on a project to send humans to space and bring them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's space scientists have consistently dismissed all questions about the value of their work as petty grudges of people who do not understand the value of their work. The scientists have considerable support among lay people, but even those who have affection for the space program find it hard to defend the Mars mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can India talk about mining Mars when the fact is that it depends on exploitative foreign companies to mine its own real estate on Earth for minerals in the first place? And if science must be a serious Indian pursuit at all, as it has to be in any nation, should not India focus all its resources on, say, mosquito-borne diseases that have killed millions of Indians? Space exploration in the time of dengue does seem baffling at first glance, but then should a nation really imagine that all its great ambitions should ideally line up according to a hierarchy of grave social importance and take up only one project at a time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramabhadran Aravamudan, who has now retired, joined the Indian space program more than five decades ago and was sent to the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> in the United States for training. He was in its Wallops Test Range the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and was baffled that NASA did not declare a holiday. He told me that even though writers have used the expression ''rocket science'' to mean a great, complex type of intelligence, ''rocket science is in many ways simpler than medical research and disease management. It is possible to have simple and clear goals in rocket science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, India's space scientists have long pointed out that the country's space program is not very expensive. This year the budget allocation to the Department of Space is 56.15 billion rupees. The travel bill for all <span class="companylink">Indian government</span> employees alone in 2011-12 was 35.19 billion rupees and is expected to be more now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program had impoverished beginnings by the Arabian Sea, inside a vacated Roman Catholic church in Thumba in southern India. So new and primitive was this science in India that its veterans are surprised it did not kill anyone. Once, three minutes before the scheduled launching of a small test rocket, a scientist pressed the siren switch to warn the local fishermen, as was the norm then, but the switch launched the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1960s, the founder of the Indian space program, Vikram A. Sarabhai, a hero in an age when scientists could be heroes even in India, learned that a new satellite telemetry and tracking station was being auctioned off as scrap in northern Australia. He sent two scientists to the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> to procure a blank foreign exchange demand draft. It was a time when it was almost impossible for Indians to take dollars out of the country, and the request for a blank demand draft seemed so ridiculous to one of the bank officials that he asked the two to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the very beginning until 2008, when India sent up a lunar orbiter that disappeared halfway into its intended mission life, the nation's space program was preoccupied with the practical task of launching cheap and locally made communications and weather satellites. The program also acquired a moral facade, which every major Indian science project is forced to acquire, of helping the poor. This the program did by using its satellites to connect remote Indian villages to the rest of the nation, and by being the eye in the sky during natural calamities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon and the Mars missions, as they did not have the ruse of immediate practical applications, had to face various forms of criticism, all of which raised the same familiar question: ''Why is a poor country doing this?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raj Chengappa, a journalist who has covered the space program for several years, is among those who find criticism of the program ''short-sighted.'' When the time comes for humanity to decide what on Mars belongs to whom, he told me, ''India has the chance to be at the high table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the criticism against the Mars mission is not so much an indictment of India's space program as it is a lament against India. The inescapable question is why does primary health care in India not have the sort of scientist-hero founder, the dedicated researchers and the extraordinary government support that its space program has enjoyed? Was it just that rocket science, despite what writers who majored in humanities imagine, truly is simpler than the war against the mosquito?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re All Martians, Scientist Claims,” The Telegraph wrote[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/10271054/Were-all-Martians-scientist-claims.html] on Aug. 28. Similar articles showed up in newspapers and on Web sites around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist who inspired all the headlines is a chemist named Steven Benner. Headlines notwithstanding, Dr. Benner[http://www.ffame.org/sbenner.php] is not a wild-eyed U.F.O. advocate claiming to have seen Little Green Men. Instead, he is one of the world’s leading experts on the origin of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Steve is one of the master organic chemists tackling this problem,” said Robert M. Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution and the author of “The Story of Earth.”[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780670023554,00.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause for Dr. Benner’s new-found celebrity is a lecture[http://goldschmidt.info/2013/abstracts/abstractView?abstractId=2239] he delivered at a geology conference in Florence on Aug. 29. During his talk, he did not wave satellite pictures of canals on Mars, or of Martian hills that vaguely look like a human face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he challenged his fellow scientists to look hard at the evidence we have about how life began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on how you view that evidence, Dr. Benner argued, Mars might be a more likely place for life to start than Earth. The best way to determine the actual answer, Dr. Benner argued, is to look for certain types of chemicals on both planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I really don’t have a dog in this fight,” said Dr. Benner, a distinguished fellow at the Westheimer Institute at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution[http://www.ffame.org/home.php] in Gainesville, Fla., in a telephone interview after he returned from Italy. “It could go either way and I would be equally happy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, Dr. Benner and his colleagues have amassed evidence for one potential path by which chemicals could have become living matter. Small organic compounds could have reacted with each other to produce string-shaped, self-replicating molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These strands, known as RNA, later combined into double-strands: the DNA in which we and other species encode our genes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In chemical experiments, Dr. Benner and his colleagues have demonstrated the occurrence of many of the reactions in this path. But they’ve also discovered roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the precursors to RNA can bond in a lot of ways, some good and some bad. While some reactions can lead organic molecules toward RNA, many others can turn them into gooey tar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Benner and his colleagues discovered that minerals containing borate could help life overcome this obstacle. Binding to the precursors of RNA, borate blocks them from reacting in destructive ways, so they are much more likely to form compounds that could eventually give rise to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in the presence of borate, Dr. Benner and his colleagues have found, these precursors can’t make some of the final changes that turn them into RNA. And just recently the researchers found a way out of this bind. Molybdate minerals can react with the precursors to help them become RNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this chemistry may work in the lab, however, it may not have worked on the early Earth. Dr. Hazen and other geologists have argued that it’s unlikely that borate or molybdate were abundant on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, borate is found in deserts that formed after large seas evaporated. But deserts may not have existed 4 billion years ago. A number of studies suggest that the early Earth was covered in water and had few if any continents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for molybdate, it only forms in the presence of oxygen. The atmosphere of the early Earth appears to have been nearly oxygen-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, Mars looks more promising to Dr. Benner. The evidence gathered by satellites and rovers suggests that both oceans and continents existed early in the planet’s lifetime. Under those conditions, borate might have formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just this June, some more evidence emerged that supports this idea. Studying a meteorite from Mars, scientists at the University of Hawaii reported[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0064624] that it contained high levels of boron, a component of borate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atmosphere of early Mars also shows signs of having contained oxygen, enabling molybdate to form. With a supply of both borate and molybdate, Mars might have been a favorable place for RNA to emerge, and for life to start. A giant impact on the Red Planet could then kick up microbe-laden rocks, which later fell to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his recent lecture, Dr. Benner did not present this argument as proof that we are Martians. Instead, he offered a way to organize our thinking about the origin of life. One of his lecture slides was entitled “A Logic Tree.” It displayed a series of linked questions that scientists should ask themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first question is, did life start out as RNA? If the answer is no — and some scientists believe that to be the case — then they have to grapple with a different set of challenges to explain the origin of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists who do accept an RNA-based origin of life, however, they need to find chemistry to produce it. Dr. Benner has one hypothesis. If scientists don’t like it, then it’s up to them to find an alternative — which other scientists are indeed doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you accept Dr. Benner’s chemistry, then you have to find a place with oxygen and dry land where it can unfold. If the early Earth doesn’t meet those standards, then we have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s the logic that drives you to Mars,” said Dr. Benner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hazen, who invited Dr. Benner to deliver the lecture in Italy, said: “He made a good, logical case.” He praised Dr. Benner’s specific suggestions about what evidence geologists should be looking for to see which way we should travel down the logic tree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hazen, for one, is taking Dr. Benner up on the challenge to find evidence to test our ideas about the origin of life. He is now studying 3.8-billion-year-old rocks from Greenland, inside which are boron-laden minerals. If the boron once existed as borate in deserts — something Dr. Hazen doubts — then it may have left some clues behind in the rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I want to prove myself wrong before somebody else does,” said Dr. Hazen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Hazen’s research bears fruit, then Dr. Benner will happily abandon the idea that our ancestors started out on the Red Planet. “Then I have all the deserts I need. I don’t have to go to Mars,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 12, 2013, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to borate and molybdate. They are compounds that are found in certain minerals, not minerals themselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, Calif. — The spacecraft’s technology was laughable by today’s standards: it carried an 8-track tape recorder and computers with 240,000 times less memory than a low-end iPhone. When it left Earth 36 years ago, it was designed as a four-year mission to Saturn, and everything after that was gravy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Voyager I has become — unexpectedly — the Little Spacecraft That Could. On Thursday, scientists declared that it had become the first man-made object to exit the solar system, a breathtaking achievement that NASA could only fantasize about back when it was launched in 1977, the same year that “Star Wars” was released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know if it’s in the same league as landing on the moon, but it’s right up there — ‘Star Trek’ stuff, for sure,” said Donald A. Gurnett, a professor of physics at the <span class="companylink">University of Iowa</span> and the co-author of a paper published Thursday[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2872/content/early/2013/09/11/science.1241681.abstract] in the journal Science about Voyager’s feat. “I mean, consider the distance. It’s hard even for scientists to comprehend.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among planetary scientists, who tend to dream large, the idea that something they built could travel so far for so long and pierce the Sun’s reach is an impressive one. Plenty of telescopes gaze at the far parts of the Milky Way, but Voyager 1 can now touch and feel this unexplored region and send back detailed dispatches. Given the distance, it takes about 17 hours for Voyager’s signals to reach NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is historic stuff, a bit like the first exploration of Earth, and we had to look at the data very, very carefully,” said Edward C. Stone, 77, NASA’s top Voyager expert[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2004/0708flare_bios.html], who has been working on the project since 1972. Ever the stoical scientist, he does get excited about what comes next. “It’s now the start of a whole new mission,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lonely probe, which is 11.7 billion miles from Earth and hurtling away at 38,000 miles per hour, has long been on the verge of bursting through the heliosphere, a vast, bullet-shaped bubble of particles blown out by the sun. Scientists have spent this year debating whether it had done so, interpreting the data Voyager sent back in different ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now it is official that Voyager 1 passed into the cool, dark and unknown vastness of interstellar space, a place full of dust, plasma and other matter from exploded stars. The article in Science pinpointed a date: Aug. 25, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for,” said Jia-Rui C. Cook, the media liaison at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in an e-mail to a reporter. “I can’t even sleep it’s so exciting!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coincidentally, the same month that Voyager 1 left the solar system, Curiosity, NASA’s state-of-the-art rover, landed on Mars and started sending home gorgeous snapshots. Soon afterward, Curiosity’s exploration team, some 400 strong, dazzled the world by driving the $2.5 billion robot across a patch of Martian terrain, a feat that turned the Red Bull-chugging engineers and scientists of Building 264 of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus into rock stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spoof video, “We’re NASA and We Know It,” [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvNhsWMU0c]recorded to the beat of the song “Sexy and I Know It,” generated 2.8 million views on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager, meanwhile, stopped sending home pictures in 1990[http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html], to conserve energy. In its heyday, it pumped out never-before-seen images of Jupiter and Saturn[http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/imagesvideo/imagesbyvoyager.html], but lately there has not been much to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the mission lost its sizzle, its 12-person staff was booted from the laboratory’s campus and sent to cramped quarters down the street next to a <span class="companylink">McDonald’s</span>. Suzanne R. Dodd, the Voyager project manager, said that when she has attended meetings in Building 264, she has kept a low profile in deference to the Mars team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I try to stay out of the elevator and take the stairs,” Ms. Dodd said. “They’re doing important work there, and I’ll only slow them down.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now she and her team seem poised to be back in the spotlight, perhaps for years to come. Dr. Stone, vice provost for special projects at the <span class="companylink">California Institute of Technology</span> and former director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, expects Voyager 1 to keep sending back data — with a 23-watt transmitter, about the equivalent of a refrigerator light bulb — until roughly 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the aging spacecraft has made things easy. An instrument that measures the energy of particles in plasma stopped working in 1980. But scientists still have access to a related sensor, a spindly antenna that records electron oscillations in plasma. The catch is that these oscillations don’t occur all the time; they typically happen when stirred up by a solar eruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 1’s plasma wave antenna picked up audible vibrations in April and May that allowed Dr. Gurnett and his colleagues to calculate the density of the plasma around the spacecraft, which would help them determine whether the craft was still in the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was exactly what we expected for interstellar plasma,” Dr. Gurnett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, by combing through older oscillation data collected by Voyager 1, the team discovered that the edge of the solar system — the threshold that was crossed in late summer of 2012 — was roughly where Dr. Gurnett predicted it would be back in 1993 by using different solar storm calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Am I bragging here? No,” he said. “All right. I admit it. It’s bragging a little.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the solar system’s edge grew tantalizingly close, NASA asked Ms. Dodd and her team to increase the amount of data collection. The problem: 8-track recorders from 1977 are not exactly bursting with extra space. Could she even find anyone who specialized in that piece of recording technology?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These younger engineers can write a lot of sloppy code, and it doesn’t matter, but here, with very limited capacity,” said Ms. Dodd, “you have to be extremely precise and have a real strategy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 52, Ms. Dodd is a relative newcomer to Voyager, first working on the mission in 1984, when Voyager 2 — a companion spacecraft also launched in 1977 and still inside the solar system — was headed toward Uranus. But she was able to find her man: Lawrence J. Zottarelli, 77, a retired NASA engineer. He came up with a solution. But would it work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zottarelli waited at Voyager mission control one afternoon last month to find out. The first of the newly programmed data dumps was set to come down. Ms. Dodd, Dr. Stone and Mr. Zottarelli watched two old <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span> computers like children watching for a chick to peck through an egg. “Nine, eight, seven,” Dr. Stone counted down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everything’s fine,” said Mr. Zottarelli, flashing a thumbs up and hiking up his trousers. “You’re on your own now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relief was written all over Ms. Dodd’s face, too. “It’s not easy flying an old spacecraft,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her eyes moved to Dr. Stone, who was peering at a computer through his trifocals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are lots of old missions,” he responded, a sly smile taking over his face. “But not many are doing exciting new things.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BALTIMORE -- MANY scientists believe that by transforming the earth's natural landscapes, we are undermining the very life support systems that sustain us. Like bacteria in a petri dish, our exploding numbers are reaching the limits of a finite planet, with dire consequences. Disaster looms as humans exceed the earth's natural carrying capacity. Clearly, this could not be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is nonsense. Even today, I hear some of my scientific colleagues repeat these and similar claims -- often unchallenged. And once, I too believed them. Yet these claims demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the ecology of human systems. The conditions that sustain humanity are not natural and never have been. Since prehistory, human populations have used technologies and engineered ecosystems to sustain populations well beyond the capabilities of unaltered ''natural'' ecosystems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence from archaeology is clear. Our predecessors in the genus Homo used social hunting strategies and tools of stone and fire to extract more sustenance from landscapes than would otherwise be possible. And, of course, Homo sapiens went much further, learning over generations, once their preferred big game became rare or extinct, to make use of a far broader spectrum of species. They did this by extracting more nutrients from these species by cooking and grinding them, by propagating the most useful species and by burning woodlands to enhance hunting and foraging success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the last ice age had ended, thousands of years before agriculture, hunter-gatherer societies were well established across the earth and depended increasingly on sophisticated technological strategies to sustain growing populations in landscapes long ago transformed by their ancestors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet's carrying capacity for prehistoric human hunter-gatherers was probably no more than 100 million. But without their Paleolithic technologies and ways of life, the number would be far less -- perhaps a few tens of millions. The rise of agriculture enabled even greater population growth requiring ever more intensive land-use practices to gain more sustenance from the same old land. At their peak, those agricultural systems might have sustained as many as three billion people in poverty on near-vegetarian diets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world population is now estimated at 7.2 billion. But with current industrial technologies, the <span class="companylink">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</span> has estimated that the more than nine billion people expected by 2050 as the population nears its peak could be supported as long as necessary investments in infrastructure and conducive trade, anti-poverty and food security policies are in place. Who knows what will be possible with the technologies of the future? The important message from these rough numbers should be clear. There really is no such thing as a human carrying capacity. We are nothing at all like bacteria in a petri dish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is it that highly trained natural scientists don't understand this? My experience is likely to be illustrative. Trained as a biologist, I learned the classic mathematics of population growth -- that populations must have their limits and must ultimately reach a balance with their environments. Not to think so would be to misunderstand physics: there is only one earth, of course!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only after years of research into the ecology of agriculture in China that I reached the point where my observations forced me to see beyond my biologists's blinders. Unable to explain how populations grew for millenniums while increasing the productivity of the same land, I discovered the agricultural economist Ester Boserup, the antidote to the demographer and economist Thomas Malthus and his theory that population growth tends to outrun the food supply. Her theories of population growth as a driver of land productivity explained the data I was gathering in ways that Malthus could never do. While remaining an ecologist, I became a fellow traveler with those who directly study long-term human-environment relationships -- archaeologists, geographers, environmental historians and agricultural economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science of human sustenance is inherently a social science. Neither physics nor chemistry nor even biology is adequate to understand how it has been possible for one species to reshape both its own future and the destiny of an entire planet. This is the science of the Anthropocene. The idea that humans must live within the natural environmental limits of our planet denies the realities of our entire history, and most likely the future. Humans are niche creators. We transform ecosystems to sustain ourselves. This is what we do and have always done. Our planet's human-carrying capacity emerges from the capabilities of our social systems and our technologies more than from any environmental limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two hundred thousand years ago we started down this path. The planet will never be the same. It is time for all of us to wake up to the limits we really face: the social and technological systems that sustain us need improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no environmental reason for people to go hungry now or in the future. There is no need to use any more land to sustain humanity -- increasing land productivity using existing technologies can boost global supplies and even leave more land for nature -- a goal that is both more popular and more possible than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only limits to creating a planet that future generations will be proud of are our imaginations and our social systems. In moving toward a better Anthropocene, the environment will be what we make it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s no surprise that Erle C. Ellis[http://ges.umbc.edu/ellis/], an ecologist at the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span>, Baltimore County, faced resistance[https://plus.google.com/u/0/106981109992478346191/posts/2jU6Ukmoz2t] when The Times published his Op-Ed article titled “Overpopulation is Not the Problem.[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/opinion/overpopulation-is-not-the-problem.html]” After all, his views clash with decades of assertions that we’re in “overshoot[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/gfn/page/earth_overshoot_day/]” as a species, sucking up far more resources than the planet can continue to offer. His answer to my enduring question here — “Which Comes First, Peak Everything or Peak us?[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/?s=%22peak+us%22+%22peak+everything%22]” — is the latter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a guest contribution below, Ellis, a frequent presence on Dot Earth[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/?s=erle+ellis+baltimore+anthropocene], expands on the points in his Op-Ed piece hoping to clarify potential misperceptions and defend his main thesis:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earth Does Not Have&nbsp;a Human Carrying Capacity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Erle Ellis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interests of avoiding misunderstandings, I’ve compiled a short list of comments and responses to criticisms of my September 14, 2013 NYT Op-Ed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who I am.&nbsp; I am an environmental scientist (Ph.D. in plant biology from Cornell University, 1990).&nbsp; More about my research here[http://ecotope.org/people/ellis/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did I write this op-ed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I did not intend this to be an op-ed about population.&nbsp; My goal was to correct a widespread misunderstanding about how humans sustain themselves. Aside from wild fish and a few remaining wild products, agriculture and industrial systems are the primary life support systems for humanity today.&nbsp; Even before agriculture, human societies required technologies and social strategies to sustain their populations well above what natural ecosystems could provide.&nbsp; Moreover, denser populations tend to drive increasingly productive and efficient use of land.&nbsp; Scientists who study long-term human/environment relationships, such as archaeologists and environmental historians, know of this as “intensification” or “niche construction”.&nbsp; Some useful readings on how human populations sustain themselves in the face of population pressures:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overpopulation is not THE problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger population sizes and rapid growth rates create greater demands on both societies and environments.&nbsp; Human activities can degrade the productive capacity of land (though this is not inevitable, and the opposite also occurrs).&nbsp; However, more robust societies with greater technological capabilities fare much better with the same populations under the same environmental conditions.&nbsp; Societal collapses due to populations reaching “environmental limits” are not the norm (social failures and epidemic disease are; Butzer 2012. Collapse, environment, and society.&nbsp; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp;109:3632-3639[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2751/content/109/10/3632.full]).&nbsp; Most importantly, existing technologies could sustain current and anticipated human populations while increasingly sparing land for nature.&nbsp; Human well being and improved stewardship of the biosphere are limited primarily by the strength of social systems and technologies, not by population or environment. There are no panaceas, technological, social, economic or political.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I see no other way forward for humanity or nature but by improving our social systems and technologies.&nbsp; Though it will not be easy and success is not guaranteed, I am optimistic that we can continue to improve these for the benefit of both humanity and nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no environmental/physical limits to humanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course our planet has limits.&nbsp; However the total number of people that can be supported by Earth’s resources can not be predicted&nbsp;merely by knowing the total amount of matter or surface area&nbsp;on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on existing technological capabilities, the 9 to 10 billion humans now forecasted for this century – when human populations are expected to peak- can be sustained using existing resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have speculated on how many people might be supported on Earth in theory- and huge numbers have been proposed.&nbsp; This is not the point- I am concerned about what the real-world limits are to human well-being and improved stewardship of the biosphere.&nbsp; Some readings on the theory of physical limits to humanity:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a scientist, I would be doing a disservice to both humanity and the environment by not calling attention to what I see as the strongest empirical facts.&nbsp; I see a very high probability that humanity will sustain a population of at least 9 to 10 billion for one century or longer.&nbsp; However, this does not mean that humanity is doomed to “destroy the planet” or to endure a catastrophic population collapse.&nbsp; Given that our populations are going to be huge and sustained, it is imperative to focus not on environmental limits to populations, but on the real social and technological opportunities we have to enable both humanity and nature to thrive in the face of some very real challenges.&nbsp;A wide variety of natural scientists are eagerly engaging in the effort to advance the science of social-ecological systems in this effort.&nbsp; Further reading:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You do not consider climate change &amp; pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapid global climate change is being caused by carbon pollution, and other forms of pollution are also serious problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollution is generally a tremendous costly mistake.&nbsp; Solutions exist to prevent and remediate almost all forms of pollution.&nbsp; That they are not applied is a societal failure.&nbsp; Throughout history and into the future, the poor tend to suffer more for these mistakes than the wealthy.&nbsp; Future generations will likely look back at our time and wonder why we let these mistakes happen- especially when we knew better.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, robust societies can adapt to extreme environmental changes and I am not convinced that climate change and pollution are likely to cause societal collapse .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biodiversity &amp; mass extinctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humans have caused a number of prominent extinctions, starting before the last ice-age.&nbsp; Now we are causing extinctions more rapidly than ever while altering biodiversity by moving species around.&nbsp; Humans have already transformed ecosystems across the planet, and the rates of this transformation are increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is possible, though challenging,&nbsp; for both humanity and biodiversity to thrive in the Anthropocene.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prospects for conserving and restoring biodiversity will depend on the priorities and effectiveness of human social systems.&nbsp;Example:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ausubel, J. H. 2000. The great reversal: nature’s chance to restore land and sea.&nbsp; Technology in Society 22:289-301[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2155/10.1016/S0160-791X(00)00014-2] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To me, one important element left out of this discussion of global population and resource trends is the reality that population pressures — both environmental and social — are ultimately local. My pieces since 2008 on the notion of a “population cluster bomb[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/the-population-cluster-bomb/]” go into more depth. That’s why, no matter what you think of global trends, there’s still great sense in sustained efforts to offer women the knowledge and capacity to manage family size[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/a-gates-summit-aims-to-fill-a-family-planning-gap/].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scatter. Adapt. Remember[http://www.amazon.com/Scatter-Adapt-Remember-Survive-Extinction/dp/0385535910]. This is how the upbeat new apocalyptic book by science writer Annalee Newitz[http://www.techsploitation.com/], the lead editor of the engaging tech/science/entertainment Web site io9[http://io9.com/], summarizes the strategies that could allow the human species to persist if faced with the kind of epic disruptions to Earth’s environment that have periodically erased the majority of living things[http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/mass-extinction/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Click here for an audio sample from the book[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsrSpg8Of_o] on organisms that unleashed planetary catastrophes in the past (along with the usual array of super-volcanoes and asteroid impacts).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I first wrote in 1992[http://www.slideshare.net/Revkin/reconsidered-my-1992-book-on-global-warming], an organism — Homo sapiens — is jogging important Earth systems right now, but unlike the cyanobacteria that transformed the atmosphere through the great Oxygen Catastrophe[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event] some 2.4 billion years ago, we’re aware (to some extent) of what we’re doing with the greenhouse buildup[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXTCai_NAFk].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can we survive ourselves?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I explored this and other questions about planetary hard knocks with Newitz by video hookup the other day. I think you’ll enjoy the discussion:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66VyL0d2oT4]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I thought of Newitz’s book quite a bit late last week when I was listening and speaking at a fascinating meeting at the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> exploring “The Longevity of Human Civilization: Will We Survive Our World-Changing Technologies?[http://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/news/nasa-program-2013.html]” The meeting was organized by David H. Grinspoon, the first Baruch S. Blumberg NASA/<span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> Chair in Astrobiology at the library’s Kluge Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read this Live Science post on the meeting by Tanya Lewis[http://www.livescience.com/39629-can-the-planet-survive-technology.html] to get a sense of the discussion. I’ll wait to post on the symposium until the video of the sessions, involving a cast of characters ranging from the climate scientist Ken Caldeira[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceYIMxDI0I0] to the science fiction novelist Kim Stanley Robinson[http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/]. But here’s the central question that Grinspoon used to frame the event, followed by an answer that Newitz offered me when I sent it to her by e-mail:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will human civilization on Earth be imperiled, or enhanced, by our own world-changing technologies? Will our technological abilities threaten our survival as a species, or even threaten the Earth as a whole, or will we come to live comfortably with these new powers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s Newitz’s answer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is any kind of tool-making skill that humans excel at most, it’s creating dual-use technologies. Often, our greatest technological achievements — say, trains in the nineteenth century or computers in the twentieth — can be used to improve our environments and to degrade them. As we look to the future of our civilization, we have to bear in mind that our tools will never lead to an either/or proposition in terms of progress. There will always be ambiguities. The burgeoning field of geoengineering, which could one day help us draw down excess carbon from the atmosphere and improve the environment, could also be appropriated by the military to wage war with weather. Synthetic biology could be used to enhance the health and abilities of our species, or to launch a racial purity movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this isn’t a new story. Humans have made dual-use technologies since our ancestors began chipping out flake tools — which are great for making food and clothes, but also great for murdering. There is a kind of grim hope to recalling this story from our early evolution. Despite our worst instincts, we have made it this far, often fumbling, but always solving our problems with tools. We are not perfect, and sometimes we make horrible mistakes like relying on fossil fuels for energy, or building atom bombs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, we are on the brink of understanding how to use the Earth itself as a machine to solve the problems our industrial technologies have created. As I said, our history offers a grim hope. With each new error, we build tools to remediate what we’ve done (though admittedly we then make more mistakes). It’s important to remember that there is no one thing we can do, nor any one technology we can deploy, that will guarantee all humans will use their powers wisely. Still, we can invest our efforts in new development as wisely as possible, choosing solar over coal and biodiversity over factory farms. In coming centuries, I believe we’ll strive to make the anthropocene comfortable for as many species as possible, if only for the selfish reason that it will make us comfortable too. My hope is that in the very act of inventing tools to improve the environment, we will come closer to understanding our place on the planet, as well as in a global society of creatures like ourselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager 1 has left the solar system, while back on Earth, the tallest mountain in North America turns out to be a bit shorter. Also, there was news of gustatory trickery, in the form of Sichuan peppercorns; a climate surprise, in the refreezing of Arctic ice; and some competition for the entrepreneur Elon Musk in the world of commercial space exploration.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUTER SPACE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades After Launching, a First</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, something made by humans on Earth has entered interstellar space. Instruments aboard Voyager 1, launched by NASA back in 1977, observed a year ago that the wind of particles blowing out from the Sun had suddenly disappeared. That led some to conclude that it had left the solar system, but top mission scientists disagreed, because Voyager 1 did not observe an expected change in the magnetic field. Unfortunately, the instrument that could have directly answered the question broke in 1980. But then a barrage of particles from a solar eruption passed by Voyager, and that generated vibrations that could be detected by another instrument on the spacecraft. The data matched expectations for interstellar space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GEOLOGY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shorter, but Still the Tallest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tallest mountain in North America is a little shorter than previously thought. Mount McKinley in Alaska, also known as Denali, is 20,237 feet high, according to sophisticated radar measurements by the <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span>. That shaves 83 feet off the commonly published height of 20,320 feet, determined in 1952 from photographs. National Public Radio reports that McKinley remains ahead of No. 2: Mount Logan in Canada, a mere 19,550 feet high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOOD SCIENCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tingle Is Only a Feeling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sichuan cuisine revolves around Sichuan peppercorns, which impart a numbing tingle on the tongue and lips. Researchers at <span class="companylink">University College London</span> report that it is not taste receptors in the mouth that pick up the unusual culinary quality but rather nerve fibers that detect vibrations. In other words, the spice makes your lips feel as though they are vibrating rapidly, even though they are not. The researchers were even able to determine the frequency of the faux vibrations: about 50 times a second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLIMATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arctic Ice's Comeback</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each year, the warmth of summer melts the Arctic sea ice, and as the earth warms, the ice has been shrinking. This summer, the Arctic ice bounced back -- at the end of the melting season, it was 60 percent larger in extent than it was last year. That sounds like a giant change, but last year was a record low. In addition, satellite data shows that during the previous winter, the thickness of ice was a record low, further evidence that the long-term trend is still steadily downward. And the <span class="companylink">National Climatic Data Center</span> reported last week that the United States this year experienced the 15th warmest summer on record -- the coolest since 2009, although still 1.2 degrees above the 20th-century average.</p>

A team of researchers, mostly in Britain, had earlier found a correlation in dyslexia patients between a gene, PCSK6, and handedness. That was intriguing because PCSK6 is associated with left-right symmetry in the body. A <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> blog reported that the researchers expanded their study to 2,600 people without dyslexia and found that the single gene could not fully explain handedness but that other genes, also associated with left-right symmetry, appeared to play a role.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times has published several letters responding to “Overpopulation Is Not the Problem[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/opinion/overpopulation-is-not-the-problem.html],” an Op-Ed article by the ecologist Erle C. Ellis (who expanded on that piece here[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/an-ecologist-explains-contested-view-of-planetary-limits/?ref=opinion]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is from a trio of seasoned sustainability scholars, all of whom have been longtime contacts of mine: Joel E. Cohen, Daniel P. Schrag and William C. Clark, who are, respectively, a professor of populations at Rockefeller and Columbia Universities, director of the Harvard Center for the Environment and director of the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard. (Cohen is the author of the essential reference on this issue,&nbsp;“How Many People Can the Earth Support?[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1998/oct/08/how-many-people-can-the-earth-support/]”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s their missive with a link to the other letters:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erle C. Ellis recounts his transition from a narrow, distorted biological determinism regarding the challenges facing the human population to a narrow, distorted social-scientific optimism that “the only limits to creating a planet that future generations will be proud of are our imaginations and our social systems.” Both extreme positions ignore the more complex reality that human choices interact with natural constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biology, chemistry and physics of the earth are imperfectly understood. It is not possible to predict precisely what some human choices may lead to, or whether some future environmental changes may be beyond human control. It is clear, however, that every additional billion people constrain further the choices available for life on earth, human and otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued rapid human population growth makes it harder and more costly to solve all our problems. The institutional, technological and behavioral innovations that have a chance of leading to the rosy future Mr. Ellis envisions will happen only with substantial effort and investment, and will be easier with slower or no population growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Update, Sept. 25, 11:22 a.m. |</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellis alerted me to his new piece in Science for Nature and People (SNAP): “Conserving a Used Planet: Embracing Our History as Transformers of Earth[http://www.snap.is/magazine/embracing-our-history-as-transformers-of-earth/].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Update, 11:22 a.m. | Erle Ellis sent this response by e-mail:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am honored that Cohen, Schrag and Clark have commented on my Op-Ed, and very relieved that I agree with every one of their points. That so many assumed I took opposing views on these issues has been humbling. Part of this may be blamed on editorial process — I did not choose the title: I fully agree with their points on population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I must also take responsibility: I wish I had written the quoted sentence as “the most important limits to creating a planet that future generations will be proud of are our imaginations and our sustained efforts to improve our social systems.” Meaning that solutions to our massive environmental problems like global climate change, ocean acidification, nutrient saturation, biodiversity loss and others are complex and social.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no panaceas. The natural sciences are critical in identifying these problems and seeking potential solutions, but resolving these problems will require major changes in the social systems within which our energy systems and food systems are embedded. The future of the planet is unknown and life on Earth has never been rosy. But I am convinced that human societies will continue to be capable of adaptive change in the face of massive challenges, and that at this time in history, the powers of humanity have never been greater to do so. Whether humanity can continue sustaining recent trends in human well-being while conserving and restoring Earth’s ecological heritage is up to us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In findings that are as scientifically significant as they are crushing to the popular imagination, NASA reported Thursday that its Mars rover, Curiosity, has deflated hopes that life could be thriving on Mars today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conclusion, published in the journal Science, comes from the fact that Curiosity has been looking for methane, a gas that is considered a possible calling card of microbes, and has so far found none of it. While the absence of methane does not rule out the possibility of present-day life on Mars -- there are plenty of microbes, on Earth at least, that do not produce methane -- it does return the idea to the realm of pure speculation without any hopeful data to back it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of human fascination with the possibility of life on Mars is rich, encompassing myriad works of science fiction, Percival Lowell's quixotic efforts to map what turned out to be imaginary canals, Orson Welles's panic-inducing 1938 ''War of the Worlds'' radio play, and of course Bugs Bunny's nemesis, Marvin the Martian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Marvin apparently did not emit enough methane for Curiosity's sensitive instruments to find him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't have direct evidence that there is microbial process going on,'' said Sushil K. Atreya, a professor of atmospheric and space science at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> and a member of the science team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA scientists are going strictly by their data, and they are leery about drawing broader implications to the question once posed by David Bowie, ''Is there life on Mars?'' John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist for the Curiosity mission, would go only so far as to say that the lack of this gas ''does diminish'' the possibility of methane-exhaling creatures going about their business on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would have been great if we got methane,'' Dr. Atreya said. ''It just isn't there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity, which has been trundling across the planet for a little over a year, made measurements from Martian spring to late summer, coming up empty for methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have long thought that Mars, warm and wet in its early years, could have been hospitable for life, and the new findings do not mean that it was not. But that was about three and a half billion years ago. Methane molecules break apart over a few centuries -- victims of the Sun's ultraviolet light and of chemical reactions in the atmosphere -- so any methane in the air from primordial times would have disappeared long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why reports of huge plumes of methane rising over Mars in 2003 fueled fresh hopes for Martian microbes. Those findings, based on data from telescopes on Earth and a spacecraft orbiting Mars, set off a surge of speculation and scientific interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, most of the methane comes from micro-organisms known as methanogens, but the gas is also produced without living organisms, in hydrothermal vents. Either possibility would be a surprising result for Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2003 methane readings, ''a lot people got excited and started working on it,'' said Christopher R. Webster of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the lead author of the paper in Science. ''It was a very important result, because of the magnitude of methane.'' The fresh data from Curiosity brings the earlier claims into question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is daunted. Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to the planet's exploration and settlement, said he was still convinced that Martian life was waiting to be discovered in underground aquifers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it had found methane, that would have been killer,'' Dr. Zubrin said, referring to Curiosity. ''Yes, it's disappointing in that we didn't get a pony for Christmas. But it doesn't mean there aren't ponies out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the scientists who found the methane plumes in 2003, Michael J. Mumma, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in an interview this week he was certain that his earlier measurements were still valid. He said he now believed that methane on Mars was episodic -- released in large plumes and then quickly destroyed. He suggested, half-jokingly, that there could be huge colonies of methane-eating microbes on Mars that eliminated the gas from the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mumma acknowledged that he could not identify any phenomena that would explain why methane plumes spurted out that year but not more recently, or how methane could be destroyed much more quickly on Mars than on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mars may not be operating the same way,'' he said. ''It's a puzzle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Atreya of the Curiosity team said he originally thought that highly reactive chemicals on the Martian surface could be destroying methane, as Dr. Mumma envisioned. But ''that's not panning out,'' Dr. Atreya said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simpler explanation would be that there was never much in the way of methane -- or microbes -- on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Stanley Robinson, a science fiction author, wrote three novels in the 1990s about the colonization of Mars by people from Earth, which in his version of things begins in 2026. Except for one conversation between two scientists, he completely leaves out the possibility of indigenous Martian microbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my Mars trilogy, I assumed what everyone assumed back then, which was that it was a dead rock,'' Mr. Robinson said by e-mail on Thursday. ''Actually, it would be very problematic to write that book today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days there are plans, on paper, to send humans to Mars in roughly Mr. Robinson's time frame. One of them, a private effort called Mars One, which has yet to prove it has the technology to achieve its goals, has nevertheless attracted hundreds of thousands of people to apply for a one-way trip, which theoretically would arrive in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars is smaller than Earth and would have cooled off sooner after the formation of the solar system. Some scientists have even suggested that all life on Earth could be descended from Martian microbes that were carried here embedded within meteorites. As the surface of Mars turned cold and dry and most of the air dispersed to space, microbes could have migrated underground and persisted, the thinking goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pursue the methane mystery, Curiosity was outfitted with an instrument that can measure minute quantities of methane and other gases. The first measurements by Curiosity last fall showed a definite signal from methane. ''When we saw it for it for the first time, we went 'Oh, my gosh,' '' Dr. Webster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that turned out to be from residual air from Earth carried all the way to Mars. Once the Earth air was pumped away, the methane readings disappeared, too. Last November, the scientists reported an upper limit of 6 parts per billion. Now they have pushed that down to 1.3 parts per billion and expect to improve their precision by at least another factor of 10 in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As exciting as it is to see the beautiful full-color pictures of the Martian landscape that Curiosity sends back, it is the tantalizing prospect of creatures living on a neighboring planet that fuels public interest the most, space enthusiasts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the mythology,'' said Seth Shostak, an astronomer with the Seti Institute in Mountain View, Calif., which searches for intelligent life in the universe. ''Mars is about life, not geology, as interesting as that is. That's the triumph of hope over measurement, and maybe it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a month, India is to launch a Mars orbiter that also has a methane-measuring instrument to look for the gas from orbit. ''They may be disappointed when they try to create maps of methane,'' Dr. Webster said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the height of the 11-year solar cycle, the so-called solar maximum. The face of the Sun should be pockmarked with sunspots, and cataclysmic explosions of X-rays and particles should be whizzing off every which way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the Sun has been tranquil, almost spotless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As W. Dean Pesnell, the project scientist for NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, dryly noted, ''We're not having much of a solar maximum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, a solitary sunspot blemished an otherwise blank yellow disk. In the ensuing days, a few more specks appeared, but even a small explosion, or coronal mass ejection, last Thursday seemed like the halfhearted effort of a slacker star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The truth of it is there isn't a lot going on,'' said Joseph M. Kunches, a space scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. ''It's been a bit of a dud. You look at the Sun today and you say, 'What?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who depend on Dr. Kunches's work, like satellite operators and power companies, that is actually good news. One of the worries in our highly technological 21st-century civilization is that a direct hit on Earth by a gargantuan solar storm could disable satellites and overwhelm wide swaths of power grids. A quiet Sun makes that much less likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For scientists trying to understand the dynamics in the interior of the Sun, it has been a humbling experience enlightening them about how much they do not know. ''If there's anyone who has figured it out, I haven't heard, that's for sure,'' said Douglas Biesecker, a physicist at the Space Weather Prediction Center and the chairman of a panel that had issued predictions about the solar cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do have a basic understanding. Inside the Sun, flows of electrons and protons generate magnetic fields that undulate on roughly an 11-year schedule. The roiling of the fields create regions that are cooler and darker -- sunspots. The twisting magnetic fields within sunspots periodically snap, releasing enormous amounts of energy in solar flares and coronal mass ejections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some solar cycles are ferocious while others remain calm. Why the cycle is 11 years is another mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This cycle, No. 24 since scientists started counting, has been befuddling from the start. Some expected an active cycle, similar to the ones of the recent past. Others predicted that this one would be quieter than usual; those predictions looked prescient as the lull of solar minimum stretched longer and deeper than expected. In 2008, the Sun was spotless on 266 days -- the blankest in half a century. The following year, when the percolating of sunspots should have picked up, the Sun was blank for 260 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar activity picked up in 2010 and especially 2011. Then the number of sunspots started dropping again. That was not necessarily surprising. In some previous cycles the Sun's northern hemisphere became active first, and scientists expected a second peak in sunspots as the southern hemisphere entered its active period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The southern hemisphere indeed began to perk up, but then leveled off and has remained that way for the past year, leading to more head-scratching. ''In all honesty, it really feels like the Sun can't make up its mind,'' Dr. Biesecker said. ''It's just this flat mesa, and it's not budging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is no second peak, and solar maximum actually occurred two years ago, then Solar Cycle 24 would be extremely odd -- late to start and early to end. ''What would surprise me is if it didn't pick up over the next year,'' Dr. Pesnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How far back do have scientists have to look back to find a solar maximum quite as weak? As far back as <span class="companylink">Chicago Cubs</span> fans do for a World Series championship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cycle 14 in the early 1900s was similarly quiet. (The Cubs won the 1908 World Series, about a year after the maximum of that solar cycle.) This time, solar scientists have Sun-watching satellites providing reams of data for them to analyze. ''For the first time, we'll be looking at a solar cycle that's really different from the ones we've seen before,'' Dr. Pesnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pesnell says it has already become apparent that the flow patterns within the Sun are more complicated than had been supposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the minimal sunspots, the Sun is still going through the rest of its cycle as usual. Its magnetic field is on the cusp of flipping, as expected. At solar maximum, the magnetic fields at the poles essentially disappear for a brief time, and when they re-emerge, they are pointing in the opposite direction. If you had a compass on the Sun's north pole and it were pointing north before solar maximum, it would be pointing south after solar maximum. (Actually, the compass would vaporize.) The north pole has already flipped; the south pole is behind but last month scientists at Stanford's Wilcox Solar Observatory said they expected the transition to be complete soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do see indications that solar maximum is about now,'' Dr. Pesnell said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKHOLM -- The world's top climate scientists on Friday formally embraced an upper limit on greenhouse gases for the first time, establishing a target level at which humanity must stop spewing them into the atmosphere or face irreversible climatic changes. They warned that the target is likely to be exceeded in a matter of decades unless steps are taken soon to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unveiling the latest United Nations assessment of climate science, the experts cited a litany of changes that were already under way, warned that they were likely to accelerate and expressed virtual certainty that human activity is the main cause. ''Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time,'' said Thomas F. Stocker, co-chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations-sponsored group of scientists that produced the report. ''In short, it threatens our planet, our only home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel, in issuing its most definitive assessment yet of the risks of human-caused warming, hoped to give impetus to international negotiations toward a new climate treaty, which have languished in recent years in a swamp of technical and political disputes. The group made clear that time was not on the planet's side if emissions continued unchecked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,'' the report said. ''It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report is a 36-page summary for world leaders of a 900-page report that is to be released next week on the physical science of climate change. That will be followed by additional reports in 2014 on the most likely impacts and on possible steps to limit the damage. A draft of the summary leaked last month, and the final version did not change greatly, though it was edited for clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going well beyond its four previous analyses of the emissions problem, the panel endorsed a ''carbon budget'' for humanity -- a limit on the amount of the primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, that can be produced by industrial activities and the clearing of forests. No more than one trillion metric tons of carbon could be burned and the resulting gases released into the atmosphere, the panel found, if planetary warming is to be kept below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the level of preindustrial times. That temperature is a target above which scientists believe the most dangerous effects of climate change would begin to occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over a half-trillion tons have already been burned since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and at the rate energy consumption is growing, the trillionth ton will be burned sometime around 2040, according to calculations by Myles R. Allen, a scientist at the <span class="companylink">University of Oxford</span> and one of the authors of the new report. More than three trillion tons of carbon are still left in the ground as fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the trillion-ton budget is exhausted, companies that wanted to keep burning fossil fuels would have to come up with ways to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground. In the United States, the Obama administration is moving forward with rules that would essentially require such technology, which is likely to be costly, for any future coal-burning power plants; the president's Republican opponents have accused him of waging a ''war on coal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a worldwide committee of hundreds of scientists that issues major reports every five or six years, advising governments on the latest knowledge on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group has now issued five major reports since 1990, each of them finding greater certainty that the world is warming and greater likelihood that human activity is the chief cause. The new report finds a 95 to 100 percent chance that most of the warming of recent decades is human-caused, up from the 90 to 100 percent chance cited in the last report, in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new document also acknowledges that climate science still contains uncertainties, including the likely magnitude of the warming for a given level of emissions, the rate at which the ocean will rise, and the likelihood that plants and animals will be driven to extinction. The scientists emphasized, however, that those uncertainties cut in both directions and the only way to limit the risk is to limit emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate-skeptic organizations assailed the new report as alarmist even before it was published.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Heartland Institute, a Chicago organization, issued a document last week saying that any additional global warming would likely be limited to a few tenths of a degree and that this ''would not represent a climate crisis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One issue much cited by the climate doubters is the slowdown in global warming that has occurred over the past 15 years. The report acknowledged that it was not fully understood, but said such pauses had occurred in the past and the natural variability of climate was a likely explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think that global warming means every year is going to be warmer than the year before,'' said Gerald A. Meehl, an American scientist who helped write the report. ''It's more like a stair-step kind of thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate scientists not involved in writing the new report said the authors had made a series of cautious choices in their assessment of the scientific evidence. Regarding sea level rise, for instance, they gave the first firm estimates ever contained in an intergovernmental panel report, declaring that if emissions continued at a rapid pace, the rise by the end of the 21st century could be as much as three feet. They threw out a string of published papers suggesting a worst-case rise closer to five feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the authors went out of their way to include recent papers suggesting that the earth might be less sensitive to carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought, even though serious questions have been raised about the validity of those estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report lowered the bottom end of the range of potential warming that could be expected to occur over the long term if the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere were to double, reversing a decision that the panel made in the last report and restoring a scientific consensus that had prevailed from 1979 to 2007. Six years ago, that range was reported as 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit; the new range is 2.7 to 8.1 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, President Obama's science adviser, John P. Holdren, cited increased scientific confidence ''that the kinds of harm already being experienced from climate change will continue to worsen unless and until comprehensive and vigorous action to reduce emissions is undertaken worldwide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, spoke to delegates at the meeting on Friday by video link, declaring his intention to call a meeting of heads of state in 2014 to push such a treaty forward. The last such meeting, in Copenhagen in 2009, ended in disarray.</p>
<p>CHART: Setting a Carbon Limit:  A new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  proposes an upper limit of no more than one trillion metric tons  of carbon burned and the resulting gases released into the  atmosphere. That limit will likely be exceeded within  decades unless emissions are reduced sharply. (Source: I.P.C.C.) (A3)   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One agency that has been particularly idled by the shutdown is NASA — the astronauts on the International Space Station and mission control are working, but relatively few other people are. NASA’s popular television channel [http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html‎] has gone dark, no longer showing feeds from space missions, and its various Twitter accounts [https://twitter.com/NASA] are silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even parody accounts went dark. “Due to government shutdown, we will not be posting or responding from this account,” said a message on a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account pretending to represent Voyager 2, a spacecraft flying toward the outer reaches of the Solar System. “Farewell, humans. Sort it out yourselves.” The account has since been suspended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the shutdown drag on, it could disrupt a Mars mission that is supposed to launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., between Nov. 18 and Dec. 7. Already, launching preparations have been put on hiatus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Mars-bound spacecraft misses its launch window, it would not get off the ground until 2016 when Mars and Earth next come back into a favorable alignment. The science would also be diminished, because the scientists wanted to observe the Martian atmosphere during the height of the Sun’s active period [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/science/space/the-sun-that-did-not-roar.html?ref=space], which is approximately now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certainly I’m not going to worry for a week,” said Bruce Jakosky of the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span>, the principal investigator of the mission, which is called the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission — Maven, for short — and is meant to study the planet’s upper atmosphere. “We have margin in our schedule, and we have a long launch period.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looked to be uniformly bland, which is why scientists chose it as the first rock to be examined up close last year by the Mars rover Curiosity: a run-of-the-mill volcanic rock, something to test and calibrate the rover's instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock turned out to be anything but ordinary, scientists reported last week. It is unlike any Mars rock previously examined and more like an Earth rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for the pile of windblown dust and soil that the rover spent weeks analyzing? It was not dry as dust, but contained water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such are the surprises that turn out to be a near constant of Mars exploration, according to six new papers on the red planet that appeared last week -- five in the journal Science and one in The Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new findings are ''the nuts and bolts'' of what Curiosity has discovered so far, said John P. Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist. On Sept. 19, another paper from the science team reported that Curiosity had not detected any methane, which could have been a sign of present-day microbes. The mission is designed to see whether the building blocks of life existed on Mars, especially in the distant past, but includes no experiments to directly detect life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September last year, Curiosity rolled up to the volcanic rock, a pyramid-shaped chunk about the size of a football. The science team named it Jake M after Jacob R. Matijevic, a longtime NASA rover engineer who had died the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appeared to be a chunk of basalt, like many others strewed on the Martian surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just featureless,'' said Edward M. Stolper, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of one of the Science papers. ''It wasn't expected to be interesting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the first readings came back. The mix of elements was different from that of other Martian basalts. ''It just didn't look like any of the other guys,'' Dr. Stolper said. ''I could tell that this was an unusual rock type and that it had characteristics that reminded me of certain kinds of terrestrial rocks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock was alkaline, similar to a well-known but uncommon type of rock called mugearite, which is found on volcanic islands like Hawaii. ''People say that less than 1 percent of the rocks on Earth are alkaline,'' Dr. Stolper said. ''If you plopped down on Earth, you wouldn't find something like this likely randomly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, the magma that hardens into alkaline rocks comes from the melting of rocks deep in the mantle in the presence of water. That suggests that the movement of magma and other geological processes within Mars may have been more complex and interesting than has been thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People say, 'Sure, why not?' but we haven't seen it before,'' Dr. Stolper said of the composition of Jake M. ''It's not a little bit different. It's a lot different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, Curiosity visited the dirt pile -- a stationary Martian dune piled up by gale-force winds 50,000 to 200,000 years old -- and performed the first soil test in its chemistry laboratory, which is packed into a space the size of a microwave oven. The fine dust in the pile, which was named Rocknest, was expected to be a mix of what is blowing around the entire planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks pretty similar everywhere we go,'' said Laurie A. Leshin, a professor of earth and environmental science at <span class="companylink">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</span> and the lead author of another of the Science papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the dirt was scooped into the lab and heated, it released water vapor. Other analysis showed that the dirt and dust consisted of both tiny crystals where the atoms lined up in neat patterns and what the scientists called ''amorphous'' materials -- the atoms jumbled up randomly, as in glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no evidence of water in the crystallized minerals, so all of the water -- 2 percent by weight -- was chemically bound up in the glassy particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's actually a fair amount,'' Dr. Leshin said. ''We always think of Mars as being this dry desert planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water in the dust could be a resource for future astronauts. Heating up a cubic foot of dirt would yield a couple of pints of water, Dr. Leshin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grotzinger, the project scientist, said the water could also conceivably be something for hypothetical Martian microbes to drink, although Curiosity has yet to find any of the molecules necessary for carbon-based life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possibly complicating life for human visitors, Curiosity also found that the chemicals called perchlorates, which can cause thyroid problems, are prevalent at the landing site. An earlier NASA mission, Phoenix Mars, had found perchlorates near the north pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's suggesting perhaps a global distribution of these salts,'' said Daniel P. Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory and the lead author of the paper that reported the perchlorate findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perchlorates also complicate Curiosity's search for the carbon-based molecules known as organics that could be the building blocks for life, past or present. Heated in the presence of perchlorates, organic molecules disintegrate into simple carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new movie ''Gravity'' is the closest most of us will ever come to going into space, and that may be for the best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as marooned astronauts, spinning out of control, bouncing off each other like yo-yos, is enough to make you forget your idyllic dreams of zero gravity. As Ms. Bullock tumbles and scrambles across arrays of solar panels and other spacecraft appendages, grabbing frantically at anything lest she float off to infinity -- in 3D, no less -- you feel every bounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gravity'' opens this week, but it has already won rapturous reviews at film festivals in Venice and Toronto. So when the distributor, Warner Brothers, offered me a chance to watch the movie with an actual astronaut, I happily tagged along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My companion was Michael J. Massimino, who flew missions in 2002 and 2009 to service the Hubble Space Telescope -- the same telescope the astronauts in ''Gravity'' were sent to repair. An engineer with a doctorate from M.I.T., he was delighted by the movie's fidelity to much of the space experience. During one scene, he nudged me, thrilled to point out that a tool Ms. Bullock was using looked just like his favorite space wrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also some inventive and very realistic use of the kickback from a fire extinguisher. The outboard scenery of the sunsets and auroras below comes straight from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> images taken from the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clooney, as a veteran spacewalker, with his resonant voice and folksy yarns, seems to be channeling every imperturbable astronaut you ever heard speaking from on high. And that opening scene, a long shot that begins with a majestic view of Earth and ends with Ms. Bullock's tumble, has earned the director, Alfonso Cuarón, comparisons to masters like Robert Altman and Michelangelo Antonioni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's not to like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You knew there was a ''but'' coming, right? Unfortunately, with all this verisimilitude, there is a hole in the plot: a gaping orbital impossibility big enough to drive the Starship Enterprise through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After they stop tumbling and find the shuttle destroyed and their colleagues all dead, Mr. Clooney tells Ms. Bullock that their only hope for rescue is to use his jetpack to travel to the space station, seen as a glowing light over the horizon. ''It's a long hike, but we can make it,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, space fans will groan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we recall from bitter memory, the Hubble and the space station are in vastly different orbits. Getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it. The telescope is 353 miles high, in an orbit that keeps it near the Equator; the space station is about 100 miles lower, in an orbit that takes it far north, over Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To have the movie astronauts Matt Kowalski (Mr. Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Ms. Bullock) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the Caribbean swim to London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might sound like some humorless quibble. But only 10 years ago, it was the source of a national debate on space policy, and it almost cost us the Hubble telescope. After the shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry in 2003, the NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, canceled the last remaining mission to service the telescope on the grounds that if a shuttle were to run into trouble it would not have enough fuel to reach a safe haven on the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision caused a national outcry. Congress and the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> got involved. Schoolchildren pooled their pennies to send to <span class="companylink">NASA</span> for a mission to the Hubble. Dr. Massimino reminded me that when the mission finally happened, in May 2009, another space shuttle was standing by at Cape Canaveral, ready to rocket into orbit if the astronauts needed rescue. Luckily they did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino achieved a kind of cosmic fame when, confronted with a stuck bolt that was blocking access to a broken spectrograph, he ripped a handrail off the side of the Hubble to get to it. He later said he was channeling memories of his Uncle Frank working on a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the Hubble is thriving a decade after its death sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spent several years writing about the Hubble controversy, so I suppose I might be taking this a little too personally. It would be nice to think there was a kind of infrastructure in space so you could shoot from one installation to another, whether in an emergency or to borrow a space wrench. But there isn't, and you can't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wouldn't matter so much had the producers not set such a high bar for themselves with their splendid re-creations of small things: the fogging helmets, the space tools. Violations of the known laws of physics happen in practically every frame of a ''Star Wars'' or ''Star Trek'' movie, and we don't care because we don't expect anything better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is the way it goes in the movies. They will hire art historians to make sure the curtains in Einstein's house look right -- it's a visual medium, after all -- but at some point, as the science fiction director David Twohy (''The Chronicles of Riddick'') said during a talk on movies and science, science gives way to the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, I wish they wouldn't always cheat on the physics. It makes me wish that Arthur C. Clarke, co-author of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and many science fiction classics, were still around. The opening of ''Gravity'' reminded me of ''2001'' with its balletic spaceships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir Arthur, who also invented the idea of communications satellites, took pride in getting the physics right. He reported that one story, ''Jupiter Five,'' about the discovery that a moon of Jupiter is actually an alien spaceship, had required 20 to 30 pages of orbital calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir Arthur would have found a way to let Ms. Bullock down gently, and lawfully.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Donald E. Canfield, there’s something astonishing in every breath we take. “People take oxygen for granted because it’s just there and we breathe it all the time,” said Dr. Canfield, a geochemist at the University of Southern Denmark. “But we have the only planet we know of anywhere that has oxygen on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s even more astonishing is that Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] started out with an oxygen-free atmosphere. It took billions of years before there was enough of the element to keep animals like us alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although scientists have been struggling for decades to reconstruct the rise of oxygen, they’re still making fundamental discoveries. In just the past two weeks, for example, Dr. Canfield and his colleagues have published a pair of studies that provide significant clues about some of the most important chapters in oxygen’s history. They’re finding that our weirdly oxygen-rich atmosphere is the result of a complicated dance of geology and biology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To study the ancient atmosphere, geochemists examine the chemical fingerprints left behind on rocks. Some rocks contain molecules that could have only formed in the presence of oxygen. The more of those molecules geochemists find in a rock, the more oxygen must have been in the atmosphere at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they look at the oldest rocks on Earth, they find no trace of oxygen in the atmosphere. Instead, their research indicates Earth’s primordial air was made up mostly of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen. The Sun’s rays created some free oxygen by splitting it off from carbon dioxide and other molecules. But the oxygen disappeared almost as soon as it was formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because oxygen is an enormously friendly element, forming bonds with a wide range of molecules. It attached to the iron in rocks, for example, creating rust. It joined with the hydrogen spewed out from volcanoes to form hydrogen peroxide and other compounds. Our planet, in other words, was a giant oxygen vacuum in its early years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed by three billion years ago. In the Sept.26 issue of Nature, Dr. Canfield and his colleagues reported[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2739/nature/journal/v501/n7468/full/nature12426.html] the fingerprints of oxygen in rocks from that time period. They estimate that the atmosphere three billion years ago had only 0.03 percent of today’s oxygen levels. That may not sound like much, but it marked a huge shift in Earth’s chemistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunlight alone couldn’t have put that much oxygen in the atmosphere. Only life could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By three billion years ago, some microbes had evolved the ability to carry out photosynthesis. Floating at the surface of the ocean, they used energy from sunlight to grow on carbon dioxide and water. They gave off oxygen as waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the oxygen released by these photosynthetic microbes was sucked out of the atmosphere by Earth’s vacuum. It reacted with hydrogen from volcanoes, for example. When microbes died, oxygen reacted with their carbon molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a tiny amount of oxygen remained behind because some of the organic matter from the dead microbes sank from the surface of the ocean to the sea floor, where oxygen couldn’t react with it. The oxygen remained in the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxygen remained fairly scarce for the next few hundred million years. But during that time, Earth’s vacuum was getting weak. The planet was cooling, and so its volcanoes spewed less hydrogen into the atmosphere to suck up oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his forthcoming book, “Oxygen: A Four Billion Year History,”[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10089.html] Dr. Canfield suggests that this weak vacuum drove a sudden climb in oxygen that geochemists see in rocks from about 2.3 billion years ago. “Now we get to the point where the Earth has calmed down enough that the balance has tipped in the favor of oxygen,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This oxygen boom may have added fuel to life’s fire. The extra oxygen in the atmosphere attacked rocks exposed on land, freeing up phosphorus and iron to flow into the ocean to act as fertilizer. The microbes bloomed even more, sending up even more oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporting this week in The Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2751/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1315570110], Dr. Canfield and his colleagues report that there was so much oxygen in the atmosphere that it penetrated down a thousand feet into the ocean. Dr. Canfield speculates that oxygen may have become as abundant as it is today, at least for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this boom created its own bust. Microbes rained down onto the sea floor, creating carbon-rich rocks. Later, the rocks were lifted up to form dry land, where they could react with the oxygen, pulling it out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life itself, in other words, turned Earth’s vacuum back up again. By 2 billion years ago, oxygen levels were down to about 0.01 percent of current levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life and Earth have continued to twiddle the oxygen knob over the past two billion years. When plants evolved, for example, they began storing away huge amounts of carbon in wood and other tough tissues, leaving less to react with oxygen and pull it out of the atmostphere. By 300 million years ago, oxygen levels had risen to levels as high as 50 percent higher than today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as continents moved across the globe, the planet’s geography came to favor deserts. Forests shrank, bringing down the oxygen levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Dr. Canfield gets better acquainted with the tumultuous history, he gets less certain about its future. Will Earth hold onto its remarkable supply of oxygen, or will it run low again? “I’m not sure we have a good prediction,” said Dr. Canfield. “That depends a lot on the vagaries of geography.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA’s next Mars mission is getting to the launching pad, government shutdown or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launch preparations for the Maven spacecraft – short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution – had ground to a halt Tuesday along with almost all of NASA after Congress failed to provide money for the federal government to continue operating. The scientific mission – to study the planet’s thin atmosphere – was not among the few NASA activities deemed “essential.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a lengthy shutdown could have caused Maven to miss the launch window. Mars and Earth would not come into proper alignment again until 2016, so NASA officials changed their minds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have already restarted spacecraft processing at Kennedy Space Center,” said Bruce Jakosky, the mission’s principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the science is still not considered essential, officials concluded that the launch delay could jeopardize the missions of the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers currently on Mars. The two rovers currently relay their data through two aging orbiting NASA spacecraft, Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars Odyssey has been circling Mars for a dozen years; Reconnaissance Orbiter has been there since 2006. In 2016, the planetary alignment is not as good, so Maven would have to use up more of its fuel entering orbit. “This would have precluded having sufficient fuel for Maven to carry out its science mission and to operate as a relay for any significant time,” Dr. Jakosky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are currently no other orbiters planned for Mars. If two existing orbiters failed, that would severely limit the science that Curiosity and Opportunity could perform. The Mars Express spacecraft, operated by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, could possibly be pressed into service as a communication relay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Launching Maven in 2013 protects the existing assets that are at Mars today,” Dr. Jakosky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maven is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida between Nov. 18 and Dec. 17.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Life in space is impossible.'' That stark statement of scientific fact is one of the first things to appear on screen in ''Gravity,'' but before long, it is contradicted, or at least complicated. As our eyes (from behind 3-D glasses) adjust to the vast darkness, illuminated by streaks of sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere, we detect movement that is recognizably human and hear familiar voices. Those tiny figures bouncing around on that floating contraption -- it looks like a mobile suspended from a child's bedroom ceiling -- are people. Scientists. Astronauts. Movie stars. (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in spacesuits, as Mission Specialist Ryan Stone and Mission Commander Matt Kowalski; Ed Harris, unseen and unnamed, as ''Houston'' down below).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defiance of impossibility is this movie's theme and its reason for being. But the main challenge facing the director, Alfonso Cuarón (who wrote the script with his son Jonás), is not visualizing the unimaginable so much as overcoming the audience's assumption that we've seen it all before. After more than 50 years, space travel has lost some of its luster, and movies are partly to blame for our jadedness. It has been a long time since a filmmaker conjured the awe of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' or the terror of ''Alien'' or captured afresh the spooky wonder of a trip outside our native atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuarón succeeds by tethering almost unfathomably complex techniques -- both digital and analog -- to a simple narrative. ''Gravity'' is less a science-fiction spectacle than a Jack London tale in orbit. The usual genre baggage has been jettisoned: there are no predatory extraterrestrials, no pompous flights of allegory, no extravagant pseudo-epic gestures. Instead, there is a swift and buoyant story of the struggle for survival in terrible, rapidly changing circumstances. Cosmic questions about our place in the universe are not so much avoided as subordinated to more pressing practical concerns. How do you outrun a storm of debris? Launch a landing module without fuel? Decipher an instruction manual in Russian or Chinese?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has recently been observed that not all of the film's answers to these questions are strictly accurate. The course that Stone and Kowalski plot from the Hubble Space Telescope to the International Space Station would apparently not be feasible in real life. (On the other hand, I was relieved to learn that a fire extinguisher really can serve as a makeshift zero-G jetpack. Not a spoiler, just a word to the wise.) Surely, though, the standard for a movie like this one is not realism but coherence. Every true outlaw has a code. The laws of physics are no exception, and Mr. Cuarón violates them with ingenious and exuberant rigor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accidental explosion of a communications satellite silences Houston and, what's worse, sends a blizzard of shrapnel hurtling toward the astronauts. Quite a bit goes wrong. Straps connecting astronauts to the relative security of their spacecraft are severed. Parachute lines foul engines. Fires break out inside vessels, and stuff outside is smashed to pieces. Not everyone survives. All of it -- terrifyingly and marvelously -- evades summary and confounds expectations. You have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what you see (through the exquisitely observant lenses of the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki) defies easy description. Stone and Kowalski's orbital path is perched between the inky infinite and the green, cloud-swept face of home. The perspective is dazzling and jarring, and Mr. Cuarón allows a few moments of quiet, contemplative beauty to punctuate the busy, desperate activity of staying alive. Kowalski, generally an irreverent joker, pauses to savor the sun over the Ganges, and you may find yourself picking out other geographical details. Look, there's Italy, and the Nile Valley. These reference points are as unsettling as they are reassuring, because they are glimpsed from a vantage point that is newly and profoundly alien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of estrangement owes a lot to Mr. Cuarón's use of 3-D, which surpasses even what James Cameron accomplished in the flight sequences of ''Avatar.'' More than that film (and more than ''Hugo'' or ''How to Train Your Dragon'' or any other high-quality recent specimens), ''Gravity'' treats 3-D as essential to the information it wants to share. The reason for that is summed up in the title, which names an obvious missing element. Nothing in the movie -- not hand tools or chess pieces, human bodies or cruise-ship-size space stations -- rests within a stable vertical or horizontal plane. Neither does the movie itself, which in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maybe not quite all of them, come to think of it. The script is, at times, weighed down by some heavy screenwriting clichés. Some are minor, like the fuel gauge that reads full until the glass is tapped, causing the arrow to drop. More cringe-inducing is the tragic back story stapled to Stone, a doctor on her first trip into orbit. We would care about her even without the haunting memory of a dead child, who inspires a maudlin monologue and a flight of orchestral bathos in Steven Price's otherwise canny and haunting score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will confess that the first time I saw ''Gravity,'' I found its talkiness annoying. Not just Ms. Bullock's perky-anxious soliloquizing, but also Mr. Clooney's gruff, regular-guy wisecracking. Doesn't Stone say her favorite thing about space is the silence?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a second viewing changed my mind a bit. It's not that the dialogue improved -- it will not be anyone's favorite part of the movie -- but rather that its relation to that silence became clearer. Stone and Kowalski jabber on, to themselves and each other and to Houston ''in the blind,'' partly to keep the terror of their situation at bay, to fight the overwhelming sense of how tiny and insignificant they are in the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This assertion of identity is ridiculous and also, for that very reason, affecting. For all of Mr. Cuarón's formal wizardry and pictorial grandeur, he is a humanist at heart. Much as ''Gravity'' revels in the giddy, scary thrill of weightlessness, it is, finally, about the longing to be pulled back down onto the crowded, watery sphere where life is tedious, complicated, sad and possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gravity'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Existential terror and the salty language it provokes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news: The people who track killer asteroids for NASA are still on the case, despite the government shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news: A lot of the people who inspect food aren’t. The folks from the Department of Agriculture who check meatpacking plants are still working. But the guys at the Food and Drug Administration who make routine appearances at, say, the nut-shelling factory to look for vermin, are on furlough. Not to mention a lot of the people who check shipments of seafood or vegetables from outside the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re not doing run-of-the-mill import inspections,” said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the <span class="companylink">Center for Science in the Public Interest</span>. “The F.D.A. is really falling farther behind with every day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House of Representatives has passed a bill to refund the F.D.A. This is part of a Republican strategy to approve the financing of things they like, one by one. It’s not entirely clear how popular the agency was before recent news of a salmonella outbreak erupted, but now it’s right up there with the national parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how members of Congress fill up their time during the current crisis. The Republicans introduce bills to fund a particularly sympathetic sector of government. The Democrats respond with a proposal to fund the whole government. Then the Republicans say the Democrats are the enemy of veterans, parks, national guardsmen or food inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why don’t we open the parts of government that we agree to?” demanded Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ll be here in December, doing agency by agency,” responded Dick Durbin, the assistant majority leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span> would still be on furlough. Also the Labor Department. And the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. would probably be the last to return. That would be very tough on people who have serious issues they need to resolve. For instance, my husband, Dan, recently received a notice from the agency announcing that he was dead. Apparently this is a fairly common error, but Dan wants to be bureaucratically resurrected, and there’s nobody on the other end of the phone to talk to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really, it’s all personal. In fact, a good way to think about the current standoff is that it’s a war between people who just want to have the government back and the people who want a new version of government with the priorities of Representative Ted Yoho of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am using Ted Yoho because he’s a voluble figure in the caucus of right-wing hard-liners in the House who caused the shutdown in the first place. Also in part because I really enjoy writing “Ted Yoho.” Also because he has also been one of the leading lights in the new crisis over whether to let the country go smashing though the debt ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody talks about how destabilizing doing this will be on the markets. And you’ll see that initially, but heck, I’ve seen that in my business,” Yoho told Jonathan Weisman of The New York Times. “When you go through that, and you address the problem and you address your creditors and say, ‘Listen, we’re going to pay you. We’re just not going to pay you today, but we’re going to pay you with interest and we will pay everybody that’s due money’ — if you did that, the world would say America is finally addressing their problem.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Yoho was one of the very first members of Congress to verbalize the what-the-hey theory of global finance, possibly because he had all that background in debt management from his business, which is being a large-animal veterinarian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of Republicans have begun using their life sagas to support similar theories. “We have in my household budget some bills that have to be paid and some bills that we can defer or only pay partially,” Representative Joe Barton of Texas said on CNBC. “I think paying interest on the debt has to be paid. I think paying Social Security payments have to be paid. But I don’t think paying the secretary of energy’s travel expenses have to be paid 100 cents on the dollar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sort of suggests that some members of Congress regard the Department of the Treasury as a vast warren of people with checkbooks, sorting through the mail and writing apologetic notes to Delta and <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> explaining the problem. It most definitely suggests that you do not want to lend money to a lot of people in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But back to our list:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news: The Congressional gym is open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.K., possibly only good news if you are a member of Congress. Or a person who enjoys making fun of members of Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news: The <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> called back some of its furloughed employees to try to control that salmonella outbreak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news: Most of the C.D.C. is still at home, including the ones who work on flu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And our moral is: Get your flu shot, people. Cook your chicken well. Cross your fingers and pray.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new movie ''Gravity,'' in which George Clooney and Sandra Bullock play astronauts adrift in space, has been variously praised as a riveting drama and criticized for scientific inaccuracies. But the phenomenon that sets the plot in motion is not a Hollywood fantasy. It is space junk, a very real villain. While Mr. Clooney and Ms. Bullock are out completing repairs, they hear that a Russian missile strike on a satellite has caused a chain reaction, with the debris taking out other satellites, and that flying bits of metal are coming their way. They survive the initial collision, but the junk ruins their shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perils of debris in space has long been recognized. In 1978, Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais published ''Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt,'' in which they explained, ''Satellite collisions will produce a number of fragments, some of which may be capable of fragmenting another satellite upon collision, creating even more fragments.'' Over time, the junk could impede future missions. As the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson noted on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, ''The film #Gravity depicts a scenario of catastrophic satellite destruction that can actually happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it has yet to take down a shuttle, space junk has caused real damage. Earlier this year, a Russian communications satellite was destroyed by debris from a Chinese antisatellite missile test in 2007. In 2009, an American communications satellite hit a Russian satellite 490 miles above Siberia, sending hundreds of fragments into space. Foreshadowing ''Gravity,'' a Times editorial warned of risks to the international space station, ''orbiting 215 miles up with three astronauts aboard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's space agencies have been seeking ways to reduce the growth of orbital debris. But so far, there's no agreed upon technique to remove what's already there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span> has stopped monitoring mercury contamination in the Everglades and testing water after the recent floods in Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An $8 billion space telescope, the largest in the world, waits to be tested at minus-400 degrees Fahrenheit in a closed government facility in suburban Maryland, facing the possibility of costly delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the half a million federal workers whose paychecks on Friday showed half of what they normally earn fretted about how to juggle bills and put off major purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the partial government shutdown reached its 11th day on Friday, it was affecting far more than the nation's monuments and parks, with much of the little-noticed machinery of government shifted to idle. Jobs deemed essential continued to be performed, but other tasks that have paused may take a lasting toll, even if President Obama and Congressional Republicans reach an agreement to end the shutdown soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temporary disruption of furloughed workers' spending patterns, a skittishness likely to continue even after they go back to work, is capable of measurable damage to the nation's growth rate, economists said. Federal workers are ''spooked'' and are likely to save more and spend less, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''They're going to be cautious at least into the next year,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Anderson, a furloughed worker for the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> in West Virginia, said, ''I live from paycheck to paycheck just like every other American does.'' Mr. Anderson, who earns $62,000 a year overseeing building maintenance, is worried that his credit rating will fall because he cannot pay bills this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got to tell you, this is messing me up,'' he said. ''It's going to take me a year once we go back to work to get squared away because of not getting my salary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Institutes of Health</span>, the largest financial supporter of medical research in the world, has ground to a halt during the peak of its grant-making season, suspending millions of dollars in new research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's Antarctic program has been suspended, ejecting some of the world's leading scientists from their lodgings at the South Pole, where they collect data crucial for understanding climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agencies, like the E.P.A., have been virtually shuttered. Almost 95 percent of the agency's 16,000 workers have been told to stay home. And while some longtime opponents of environmental regulation cheer that temporary outcome, others are deploring what could be lasting impacts on the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a polluter's heyday,'' said Sara Chieffo, the legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters. Normally, she said, ''they are doing the inspections that need to be done, making sure that polluters are held to account.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know that the longer this goes on, the cascading effects occur,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Ronnenberg, who is on a furlough along with thousands of other safety inspectors for the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, said tasks not being performed included inspections of the de-icing of aircraft on the tarmac and checks that pilots do not fly longer than allowed. He said the risks to flight safety increase the longer outside inspectors were off duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shutdown initially sent about 800,000 workers home on Oct 1. The Defense Department recalled most of its 350,000 civilian work force, and others who are deemed essential have returned piecemeal, like thousands of C.I.A. employees and experts at the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> needed to confront a salmonella outbreak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agreements were reached between the federal government and states to reopen a number of national parks and monuments, including the Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon National Park, Mount Rushmore and parks in Utah and Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shutdown has left close to 500,000 employees still on furlough, according to the <span class="companylink">American Federation of Government Employees</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House passed a bill to assure that they receive back pay, which the White House supports. Even if workers are financially made whole, their uncertainty about whether another shutdown could occur was giving many pause about making big purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Sailes, a mechanic at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, and his wife have put off buying a house for a year. ''We've got to sit in our apartment until we get some more money,'' he said. ''We had to push everything back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The furlough comes on top of the all-agency spending cuts earlier this year known as sequestration, which forced some workers to take unpaid leave and departments to cut budgets. Republicans applauded reducing the size of the government, but some economists calculated that the cuts have slowed the nation's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists said that one of the most serious casualties might be the country's reputation. Markus Kissler-Patig, the director of the Gemini Observatory, an international coalition with telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, said he was worried about the United States' foreign partners if the coalition's cash flow, which is administered by the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span>, were to run out. The foundation, which is almost entirely furloughed, cannot provide cash infusions during the shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am starting to hear informal feedback questioning whether the N.S.F. is the right agency to run this international observatory,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor could the timing have been worse for the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8 billion contraption that unfolds like an origami figure in space and will be capable of detecting the universe's earliest galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have toiled for years and were poised to put its inner workings to the test by simulating the vacuum of outer space in a structure the size of a grain silo when the shutdown halted work at the NASA-run facility in suburban Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just sitting there twiddling its thumbs,'' said Matt Mountain, the director of NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also suspended was work at the South Pole, which involves collecting information critical to studying climate change and can be done only a few months a year. ''In my whole career, this is the most frustrating thing I've ever seen,'' said Ross Powell, a geologist who has been going to the South Pole since the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the E.P.A., officials have allowed about 900 employees to stay on the job, responding to imminent threats to the environment or to public health. Workers are reporting for duty at toxic waste sites that pose a direct threat to surrounding communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials said the bulk of the agency's work had been suspended. Industrial chemicals are not being screened for potential health effects. Routine inspections of drinking water systems across the country have been halted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the agency's critics say the work stoppages are proof of what they have contended for years: that the agency's efforts to issue environmental rules reach too far into American life and should be curtailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is some good news out of the shutdown,'' Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. ''The E.P.A. can't issue new regulations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But supporters of the agency said the shutdown had affected critical tasks related to keeping the nation's air and water clean. Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said he hoped the shutdown would end soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The partial government shutdown has delayed investigations and ongoing scientific studies at the agency,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the E.P.A.'s shutdown has also created economic effects as the agency has stopped certifying certain products that enter the country for sale. Among those is millions of dollars' worth of chemicals used to make pesticides. They are stuck in customs because E.P.A. field workers are not available to review and approve them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the nation's ports, some cars and trucks are stuck in limbo because there are no E.P.A. inspectors to certify the emissions stickers that are put on the windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anne Lucas, a chemist for the Food and Drug Administration in Maryland who has been on furlough, said she was not worried about her finances but was unhappy to be idle so long. ''We all just want to get back to work,'' she said. ''Most federal workers are not there for the money, they're there for the service.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has been volunteering at a nature center, where she is assigned to pick up trash, a task she said was preferable to doing nothing. ''Just because I have a Ph.D. doesn't mean I'm too good to pick up trash,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next few decades I predict we will send an unmanned space craft beyond the Solar System to the nearest Earth-like planet. We must first find the other Earths — this endeavor is also in the making. Although over 1,000 exoplanets (planets orbiting stars other than the sun) have been discovered in the past two decades, the true Earth twins around nearby sun-like stars remain just out of reach. A sun-like star is 10 billion times brighter than an Earth-like planet, and finding the other Earth is like looking for a firefly adjacent to a search light, when both are 2,500 miles away. We need to block out the starlight to directly image the Earth-like planet. Sound futuristic? The human drive to find other Earths and to travel in space appears to be so fundamental that if the Earth twins are out there we will find them and find a way to go to them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Nobel Prize week, with many of the honors going to scientists at American universities. But there was plenty of news in other quarters, from Hawaii to Neptune, from lost lizards to a lost moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Theory, Then a Prize</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Peter W. Higgs of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and François Englert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium for their theory, first put forth in 1964, that there is a particle that confers mass to other particles. It took some time to find it, but using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland last year, scientists finally established the existence of Dr. Higgs's namesake particle -- the Higgs boson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medicine and Chemistry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobels, Continued</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at Yale, Berkeley and Stanford shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their elucidation of the complex system by which molecules are moved around inside cells to allow the cells to accomplish their functions. And the prize for Chemistry went to researchers at the University of Strasbourg in France, Stanford and the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span> for creating computer simulations to study complex molecular reactions like photosynthesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot Times Ahead</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, calculated that by about 2047 the average temperature over half the earth's surface will be higher than in any year between 1860 and 2005. The prediction is based on computer models that also estimate that the hottest weather could be delayed by several decades if carbon emissions are brought under control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost and Found (Part 1)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers glimpsed a moon of Neptune in 1989 as the Voyager 2 swept by the planet, but then lost sight of it for more than 20 years. Last Tuesday, scientists at a meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span> announced that they had relocated it. Using the Hubble Telescope, they spotted Naiad, as it is called, a tiny dot of light a million times fainter than Neptune, and the innermost of the planet's 14 known moons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Animal Species</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost and Found (Part 2)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pinocchio lizard, Anolis proboscis, has been found alive in northwest Ecuador. It was first described in 1953, but for many years nobody saw one and it was presumed extinct. Then some bird-watchers photographed one in 2005. Now scientists have had a close look at it in the flesh. The lizard, named for the male's prodigious nose, hides by day high in the trees.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Nobel Prize[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/nobel_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] week, with many of the honors going to scientists at American universities. But there was plenty of news in other quarters, from Hawaii to Neptune[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/neptune_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], from lost lizards to a lost moon[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/moon/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/science/englert-and-higgs-win-nobel-physics-prize.html] to Peter W. Higgs of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and François Englert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium for their theory, first put forth in 1964, that there is a particle that confers mass to other particles. It took some time to find it, but using the Large Hadron Collider[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/large_hadron_collider/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] at CERN in Switzerland last year, scientists finally established the existence of Dr. Higgs’s[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/science/chasing-the-higgs-boson-how-2-teams-of-rivals-at-CERN-searched-for-physics-most-elusive-particle.html] namesake particle — the Higgs boson[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/higgs_boson/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at Yale, Berkeley and Stanford shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/health/3-win-joint-nobel-prize-in-medicine.html] for their elucidation of the complex system by which molecules are moved around inside cells to allow the cells to accomplish their functions. And the prize for Chemistry[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/science/three-researchers-win-nobel-prize-in-chemistry.html] went to researchers at the University of Strasbourg in France, Stanford and the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span> for creating computer simulations to study complex molecular reactions like photosynthesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot Times Ahead</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, calculated that by about 2047 the average temperature over half the earth’s surface will be higher than in any year between 1860 and 2005. The prediction[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/science/earth/by-2047-coldest-years-will-be-warmer-than-hottest-in-past.html] is based on computer models that also estimate that the hottest weather could be delayed by several decades if carbon emissions are brought under control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost and Found (Part 1)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers glimpsed a moon of Neptune in 1989 as the Voyager 2 swept by the planet, but then lost sight of it for more than 20 years. Last Tuesday, scientists at a meeting of the <span class="companylink">American Astronomical Society</span>announced[http://www.universetoday.com/105361/a-tale-of-a-lost-moon-new-hubble-observations-of-neptunes-moons-and-its-rings/] that they had relocated it. Using the Hubble Telescope, they spotted Naiad, as it is called, a tiny dot of light a million times fainter than Neptune, and the innermost of the planet’s 14 known moons.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost and Found (Part 2)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pinocchio lizard, Anolis proboscis, has been found alive in northwest Ecuador. It was first described in 1953, but for many years nobody saw one and it was presumed extinct. Then some bird-watchers photographed one in 2005. Now scientists have had a close look[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/08/pinocchio-lizard-spotted/] at it in the flesh. The lizard, named for the male’s prodigious nose, hides by day high in the trees. But at night it rests, a pale shade of white, at the ends of branches.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A video sent in by  one of many students[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/what-memorable-experiences-have-you-had-in-learning-science-or-math/?apage=14#comment-1305691] who entered our contest from a Project Lead the Way[http://www.pltw.org/] school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early September, Science Times published a special back-to-school edition[http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2013/09/02//science/index.html] about teaching and learning in the STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and math — and we joined in by announcing a student contest for the best answers to the question, What Memorable Experiences Have You Had in Learning Science or Math?[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/what-memorable-experiences-have-you-had-in-learning-science-or-math/]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As former teachers ourselves, we’re well aware that the most effective lessons are usually ones that involve hands-on work, so we weren’t surprised that nearly all of the 406 entries described projects that fell into that category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were surprised, however, by the wide variety of interesting experiences students related. They posted about analyzing classroom “crime scenes,” extracting DNA, writing computer code, dissecting eyeballs, lighting desks on fire — and making everything from slime to solar-paneled cars, air cannons, catapults and toothpick bridges. One entry even explained[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/what-memorable-experiences-have-you-had-in-learning-science-or-math/?apage=5#comment-1300134] the answer to the question of whether, when a tree falls in a forest, it makes a sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were especially impressed by the teaching and learning that seems to be going on in a program called Project Lead the Way, or P.L.T.W.[http://www.pltw.org/] Many students at schools with this program wrote about how it has changed their thinking. Here’s how ZachRHS[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/what-memorable-experiences-have-you-had-in-learning-science-or-math/?apage=11#comment-1304595] put it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My greatest memory is the moment when I realized how all the things that we were doing in my PLTW courses and physics class worked. It’s an odd feeling to just realize something so obviously in front of you but masked by trying too hard to understand it. Though all this only happened a year ago, I’ve made some bigger strides in understanding how the world works in a wonky harmonious sort of way. After a while, I stopped looking at things at face value and looked at them in a ridiculously over complex manner that was really unnecessary but was definitely a new and interesting perspective on the world around me, like when I realized that induction is one of the most ingenious and coolest things I will ever have the pleasure of knowing, or that half of all the physics I know doesn’t even need mass (which still leaves me scratching my head at times).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing beats having a crazy teacher in an intensely mind-numbing, sobbing during study sessions, punching walls in frustration, kind of Biology class. (Mostly because Biology is the only class where students are trusted not to impale each other with razor sharp scalpels, or throw latex glove water balloons, with the added perk of dissections, of course.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I paint my “crazy teacher” positively mostly because of the one defining, unforgettable, mind-blowingly awesome moment that occurred during our pig dissections. After detaching the lungs from my pig, Sir Bacon, cutting away the grayish-pinkish globs of muscle, fat, and skin, my teacher deftly placed them on a tray and ushered the class over with a wave of his hand. We gathered around and watched in awe as he skillfully inserted a straw into the larynx, smiled, then blew, inflating the dull pink lungs to a bright, flaming pinkish red. Obviously we students took advantage of this moment to ask for multiple do overs, which by the end, even the most dedicated teacher in the school had to stop due to the “nasty dead-tissue” taste that crept up the straw and into his mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I like to think that it was that incredible moment that turned Sir Bacon from just another, albeit far more interesting, project to a living organism. It was indeed the first time any of us had, outside the television screen, seen an organism’s actual function and the first time that a teacher had stepped out of his role as an educator and entered the realm of “cool science.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was a third grader my teacher brought my class outside and made us sit down on the grass. She said “grab a blade of grass and think about how many blades of grass are in the entire area we are sitting in.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that was the first time of my life I was told to think outside of the box. It opened a whole new window to me. I started thinking more about what was around me and how it affected me. After thinking very hard about how many blades of grass were surrounding me I probably guessed a few hundred. My teacher then showed us how to find a good estimate by counting the number of blades out in a very small area. Then we had to find out how much space the whole area was. After that we multiplied the number of grass blades by the entire area and we found the answer. Once I heard what the calculator said, I remember my jaw dropped by now knowing there was hundreds of thousands to millions of grass blades surrounding me. This was my first memory of math and I will never forget how it changed my perspective of numbers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of my favorite stories that I heard in class was the process by which Neptune and Pluto were discovered. After scientists realized that Uranus’s orbit was not following the path that it should, they worked to figure out what went wrong in their calculations. Using Newton’s theory of gravitation, a scientist examined the effects of the hidden planet’s gravity on other planets to develop a possible orbit. Eventually Neptune was found but still it didn’t follow its projected orbit. Using a similar process that was used to find Neptune, scientists also discovered Pluto. That is what is great about mathematics and science, they can document both the seen and unseen world. Scientists could not see these planets, but they knew something was there and used math and reasoning to discover something that was not obvious.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My most memorable experience was when my third grade math teacher had a multiplication contest to encourage his students to learn their times tables. You maybe asking yourself “why would a third grader want to participate in a multiplication contest?” Well, as you may know, there is always the BIG Prize. I had studied really hard because I was never good at remembering my times tables and I was determined to do well. The day of the contest I was up against at least 25 of my classmates and in the end, I WON! I was the multiplication QUEEN! I was given a crown and a bag of full of goodies that included a jump rope, bubbles, dolls, bracelets and so much more. Even though that was so long ago now, I have never forgotten how good it felt be the Multiplication Queen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my Biomedical Science Principles class, we conducted an experiment that changed the way I viewed science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We set up an experiment with a marshmallow and a temperature probe. We placed the marshmallow under a coke can with the probe and water inside, and lit the marshmallow on fire. We watched the flame grow larger, and correspondingly we saw the temperature rise. We used the software Logger Pro to keep record of the temperature change. After 4 minutes we blew the flame out and analyzed our results. We saw that a marshmallows energy was 516.56 calories per gram. I now can make a more educated decision when picking a snack. This experiment I believe was an experiment that changed the attitude I had about science classes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My best moment of my science career would have to be when my physical science teacher made a pickle light up due to charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My physical science teacher had a thing for weird experiments as making bubbles or building a carrier to safety drop an egg at a certain height. There was something different about the pickle experience though because, pickles are my favorite thing to eat. As I walked into class on that day, the pickle jar was the first thing I noticed. Sitting down at my desk I blurted out “Why do we have a pickle jar?” My physical science teacher, being my favorite teacher, said “We are going to make a pickle light up!” I sat down and proceeded to think about how I wanted a pickle. I raised my hand and said something once more about the pickles. “Are we allowed to eat them?” He answered with a funny face “If you want to eat a burnt pickle then you can.” I didn’t say it out loud yet but I knew the second he got through with this small experiment that the pickle would be mine. He hooked pins into each side of the pickle and began the process as I waited my stomach was getting the best of me. And then it happened. The pickle began to glow it was as if we had put 10 lightning bugs inside it. My teacher brought the pickle to me. It might have been singed and a little burnt but that didn’t stop me. It might have been the best pickle ever.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was taught that the reason carrots are orange is because they absorb all other frequencies of light but reflect orange wavelengths. This is true of all other objects. This realization allowed me to look at the world and see everything in microscopic detail. I imagine photons on my sofa absorbing all colors except for grey and appreciate science for what it has allowed me to understand, and what it now challenges me to do: to keep discovering weird facts and to develop new theories to explain the quirky and not yet tangible parts of the universe.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day my mom broke her leg in a dreadful skiing accident, she refused to take any medication during her recovery. I wondered how someone could bear so much misery and refuse all medical help. As I investigated further, I found that “painkillers” have countless unintended adverse effects which have caused many such agents to be removed from the pharmaceutical market entirely. I found a research paper on the discovery of a compound known as anandamide within the body, naturally released to slow pain. Unfortunately, there was no lab nearby working on this unique topic. I decided to look beyond my geographical constraints, and arranged for research on Long Island. Researchers at <span class="companylink">Stony Brook University</span> in the lab of Professor Iwao Ojima had been working on anandamide uptake inhibitors, and I received a fellowship to join their lab group for the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the summer, I worked to optimize a novel anti-inflammatory medication which operated through specific enzymatic inhibition. This research opportunity allowed me to go through the process of bringing new drugs and trials to clinical use from the beginning — I started with computational drug design and progressed through organic synthesis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My memorable experience was my first trip to a planetarium in second grade. I was amazed when I looked up and saw all of the stars, planets, and constellations. I felt like I was actually there, in space. Sitting down in those cushioned seats, growing anticipation of the unknown inside of your stomach as the lights fade, and then you are exposed into a whole other world. It was amazing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I loved and still love learning about new things I never knew before. And finding out that there are millions of different things like stars and undiscovered planets and galaxies all around me is something larger than life for me to handle. Even today I am curious about the universe and its beginning. I feel that all I learned about atoms in recent years all add to that trip to the planetarium. When I think about how the universe lasts forever, my head starts to hurt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step, step, step, BONK! Ouch — I’m sure that branch used to be way higher. I’m eight years old, walking along the trail to our creek — one that I’ve walked on every day for about a year. I may be a bit of a klutz, but I would have remembered to duck under that branch — had I needed to duck under it. The fact is, I’m sure that it’s lower than it’s ever been before; I wonder … why????</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so began my interest in science. If I could sum up science in one word, it would be the word I ended the previous paragraph with: “why?”. And that “why”, the never having conclusive answers, never being able to fully say “because”, is what has kept my interest in science growing. The question “Why do tree branches move up and down? A mystery!” investigated why the branch had lowered to head-bonking height, and in Grade 3, became my first science fair project. I never figured out “why”, but I was hooked. Now in Grade 11, I’ve completed a science fair project every year since, and the amount that it has contributed toward my scientific mind and life is unimaginable. Science fair has taught me to appreciate the world through curiosity; it has taught me think analytically, and to use science to gain knowledge about the world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of my best lifelong STEM moments rest in my Physics class Junior year. Not only did I learn how to calculate how far an object will go when thrown, but I learned that time isn’t the same in any one place, that the speed of light can never be reached, that the universe is never ending, and that computers are more complicated than they seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only did my teacher spill coffee on the floor, throw balls into the ceiling, pretend to get shocked, and actually shock us, but he did all of this to demonstrate centripetal force, the transfer of motion, the way current works, and the ideas behind voltage. Sure, some moments in Physics didn’t seem educational, but they could always be tied back to what we were learning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, my favorite and most memorable activity in class was actually through PLTW’s Introduction to Engineering Design where my team was instructed to build a structure out of index cards and tape that could hold the most weight. After creating what looked like a flimsy base, our structure actually set the class record holding 26 text books!</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now, a high-altitude adventure for the leisure class, people who do not want to be jostled as they sip Champagne and gaze down at Earth's curved blue surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new space tourism company named World View unveiled its plans on Tuesday to loft passengers to the stratosphere as early as 2015, not by rocket but by giant balloon. Price: $75,000. (Drinks included.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World View is led by the same people involved in Inspiration Mars, a private endeavor to launch two people in 2018 to a flyby of the red planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very gentle flight that will last for hours aloft,'' said Jane Poynter, World View's chief executive. She said the cabin would be about the size of that of a private jet, and would have a ''superbly comfortable, luxurious interior where you can get up and stand upright and move around and go back to the bar and get a drink.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, space tourism companies like Virgin Galactic and <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> have sold hundreds of tickets for suborbital rocket trips, with the first paying passengers scheduled to get their rides as early as next year. But the rockets are essentially big roller-coaster rides, with the exciting portion at the top of the arc lasting just a few minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, World View's balloon and capsule, with six passengers and two crew members, would take about an hour and a half to reach altitude and then drift for a couple of hours before the balloon was jettisoned and the capsule would glide back to Earth beneath an inflated parasail. ''We really think there is a market for being able to contemplate the view,'' said Taber MacCallum, the company's chief technology officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World View's trips would be less expensive than the rocket rides: Virgin Galactic charges $250,000 and XCOR $95,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principal shortcoming: you would not actually get to space, nor would you get to call yourself an astronaut afterward. The balloon would rise about 18.5 miles, not quite a third of the way to the 62-mile altitude that is considered the beginning of outer space. But it is high enough to view the planet's curvature and for the sky to darken from blue to black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip would be more like that of Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil who last year leapt from a balloon at an altitude of more than 24 miles, but with more comfort and a less exhilarating return to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We promise we won't open the door and have you jump back to Earth,'' Ms. Poynter joked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the World View capsule will not reach space, the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span> will regulate it as a commercial space venture, because the capsule is built to operate in space conditions. World View's application to the F.A.A. noted that at an altitude of 20 miles, water and blood boil at a much lower temperature and decompression would be fatal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching sites have not yet been chosen. Test flights carrying scientific payloads could lift off sooner. Scientists have used balloons, small rockets, and even gliders to study the region. The nascent commercial space companies like World View could offer more opportunities for scientists at a lower cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wife-and-husband team of Ms. Poynter and Mr. MacCallum previously founded Paragon Space Development Company, the technology firm that is working with Dennis Tito, the entrepreneur who is leading the Inspiration Mars effort. Paragon will also develop World View's capsule, but the two are separate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in the venture include Philippe Bourguignon, a former president of Euro Disney and current chief executive of Miraval resorts, Ms. Poynter said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former <span class="companylink">Homestake Gold</span> Mine in Lead, S.D., has a hallowed place in the history of physics as a spot where nothing happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was there, in the 1970s, that Raymond Davis Jr. attempted to catch neutrinos, spooky subatomic particles emitted by the sun, in a vat of cleaning fluid a mile underground and for a long time came up empty. For revolutionizing the study of those particles, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, an international team of physicists based in the same cavern of the former mine announced a new milestone of frustration, but also hope -- this time in the search for dark matter, the mysterious, invisible ingredient that astronomers say makes up a quarter of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first three months of running the biggest, most sensitive dark matter detector yet -- a vat of 368 kilograms of liquid xenon cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit -- the researchers said they had not seen a trace of the clouds of particles that theorists say should be wafting through space, the galaxy, the Earth and, of course, ourselves, knocking out at least one controversial class of dark matter candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the experiment has just begun and will run for all of next year. The detector, already twice as sensitive as the next best one, will gain another factor of sensitivity in the coming run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just because we don't see anything in the first run doesn't mean we won't see anything in the second,'' said Richard Gaitskell, a professor of physics at <span class="companylink">Brown University</span> and a spokesman for an international collaboration that operates the experiment known as LUX, for the Large Underground Xenon dark matter experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As has become de rigueur for such occasions, the scientists took pride and hope in how clearly they did not see anything. ''In 25 years of searching, this is the cleanest signal I've ever seen,'' Dr. Gaitskell said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That meant, the scientists said, that their detector was working so well that they would easily see a dark matter particle if and when it decided to drop by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, they had support from outside scientists. Neal Weiner, a particle theorist at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, called the results impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have not found dark matter,'' he said. ''There is nothing smacking you in the face to make you think there is something there.'' But as the sensitivity of the detector increases, he added, ''If there is anything in there, it should become apparent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement at the Homestake site capped a morning of ceremony, which included Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota and members of the State Legislature, at what amounted to a coming-out party for LUX and for the Sanford Underground Research Facility, a lab being developed in the old mine with a mix of state and private money, as well as support from the Energy Department. The lab is named after the philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, who donated $70 million to get it going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LUX is the latest in a long series of ever-larger experiments that have occupied and taunted the world's physicists over the last few years. They are all in abandoned mines or other underground places to shield them from cosmic rays, which could cause false alarms. Daniel McKinsey, an associate professor of physics at Yale and a spokesman for the LUX group, said in an interview that the biggest source of noise in the LUX device was trace radioactivity in the detector itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger instruments are already on the drawing boards of LUX and other collaborations, but physicists say the experiments are already sensitive enough to test some versions of dark matter that have been proposed, including the idea that dark particles interact with ordinary matter by exchanging the recently discovered Higgs boson. Dr. Weiner said he held his breath every time new results from a dark matter experiment were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter has teased and tantalized physicists since the 1970s, when it was demonstrated that some invisible material must be providing the gravitational glue to hold galaxies together. Determining what it is would provide insight into particles and forces not described by the Standard Model that now rules physics, not to mention a slew of Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists' best guess is that this dark matter consists of clouds of exotic subatomic particles left over from the Big Bang and known generically as WIMPs, for weakly interacting massive particles, which would weigh several hundred times as much as a proton but could nevertheless pass through the Earth like smoke through a screen door. They are a generic feature of a much-hyped idea known as supersymmetry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particle physicists have been hoping to produce these particles or other evidence of supersymmetry in the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva or to read their signature in cosmic rays from outer space. No one has ever claimed to have seen such a heavy WIMP, in space or underground, but another experiment in another mine, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, claims to have recorded three events that could have been low-mass dark matter particles, only a few times heavier than a proton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new results from the Homestake mine, if they are correct, would rule out those low-mass particles. Dr. Gaitskell explained that if those particles were real, the Homestake detector would have recorded 1,550 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there are 1,550 of them, boy are we going to see them,'' he said in a presentation at the Homestake facility on Wednesday. ''We do not see the low-mass WIMPS.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But afterward, Juan I. Collar, a dark matter specialist at the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> who has been urging the community to take low-mass WIMPs seriously, questioned whether the LUX detector had been adequately calibrated to detect them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They do have a real interest in performing those calibrations, because they would settle the issue,'' Dr. Collar said in an email. ''We just have to be patient. At the end they promised to do so, and I have no doubts they will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, a quarter of the universe is still missing in action.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 78b, a planet some 400 light-years away, is like hell on earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers described it on Wednesday as the first Earth-size planet that seems to be made of the same mixture of rock and iron as Earth, and that orbits a star similar to our sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler 78b would not be a pleasant place to visit. It whirls around its parent star, Kepler 78, at a distance of less than a million miles, and its year -- the time it takes to complete one orbit -- is just eight and a half hours. (By contrast, Earth is 93 million miles from the sun and, of course, completes its yearly orbit in a little over 365 days.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that close proximity, the surface of Kepler 78b is infernally hot: 3,500 to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, or ''well above the temperature where rock melts,'' said Andrew W. Howard, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii and the lead author of one of two papers being published in the journal Nature. ''This is probably one of the most hellish planets that have been discovered yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewed from the surface of Kepler 78b, its star would cover 80 times more of the sky than the sun does in Earth's sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly not a habitable planet,'' said Francesco Pepe, a professor of astronomy at the University of Geneva and the lead author of the other Nature paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 78b is the newest addition to the pantheon of oddball planets in the Milky Way. The first planet discovered around another sunlike star turned out to be about the size of Jupiter, but orbiting its star at what seemed to be an impossibly close orbit. Other discoveries over the years include a fluffy planet with a density less than that of cork and a planet blacker than coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Exoplanets are just surprising us with their diversity,'' said Dimitar D. Sasselov, a professor of astronomy at Harvard and a member of Dr. Pepe's team, using the name for planets outside our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 78b is one of more than 150 planets spotted by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which noted the dimming of the starlight when a planet passed in front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those findings were published in August. But while Kepler can determine exoplanets' size and orbit, it cannot measure their mass. For that, two teams of astronomers looked at Kepler 78b star from Earth. Dr. Howard's team used the Keck 1 telescope in Hawaii; Dr. Pepe's team used a telescope in the Canary Islands. They could not directly see the planet, but they could spot undulations in the frequency of light from the star caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The heavier the planet, the larger the swings in frequency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teams coordinated their work, agreeing to publish their results at the same time, but they did not collaborate. They decided that they would not exchange their data and answers until their papers were almost complete so that each would serve as an independent check on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the two teams came up with nearly identical answers. The density of Kepler 78b is 0.2 pounds per cubic inch, the same as Earth's, suggesting that the two planets' makeup is very similar -- an iron core with rocky, if melted, outer layers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the first really well measured Earthlike composition for a rocky extrasolar planet,'' said L. Drake Deming, a professor of astronomy at the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> who was not a member of either team but wrote an accompanying commentary for Nature. That astronomers have already found an Earthlike planet suggests that there should be others in cooler, more life-friendly orbits. ''You can reasonably conclude from that that it's not rare, because you've found it pretty easily,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That still leaves a mystery: how Kepler 78b got where it is. ''Right now, we have no clue,'' Dr. Sasselov said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could not have formed there, because the star as a youngster would have extended into its orbit. A near-miss with another planet could have flung it toward the star, but in that case its orbit would have been elliptical, not circular. Or it was nudged inward by the material that formed the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is that it was originally a gas giant like Saturn and that as the planet spiraled in toward the star, all of the gases were stripped away, leaving just the rocky core at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, this scenario doesn't work, either,'' Dr. Sasselov said. ''If you want me to choose out of four bad ones, that's probably the one which seems least so.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe known odds of something -- or someone -- living far, far away from Earth improved beyond astronomers' boldest dreams on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reported that there could be as many as 40 billion habitable Earth-size planets in the galaxy, based on a new analysis of data from NASA's Kepler spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One out of every five sunlike stars in the galaxy has a planet the size of Earth circling it in the Goldilocks zone -- not too hot, not too cold -- where surface temperatures should be compatible with liquid water, according to a herculean three-year calculation based on data from the Kepler spacecraft by Erik Petigura, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petigura's analysis represents a major step toward the main goal of the Kepler mission, which was to measure what fraction of sunlike stars in the galaxy have Earth-size planets. Sometimes called eta-Earth, it is an important factor in the so-called Drake equation used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe. Mr. Petigura's paper, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span>, puts another smiley face on a cosmos that has gotten increasingly friendly and fecund-looking over the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems that the universe produces plentiful real estate for life that somehow resembles life on Earth,'' Mr. Petigura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last two decades, astronomers have logged more than 1,000 planets around other stars, so-called exoplanets, and Kepler, in its four years of life before being derailed by a mechanical pointing malfunction last winter, has compiled a list of some 3,500 more candidates. The new result could steer plans in the next few years and decades to find a twin of the Earth -- Earth 2.0, in the argot -- that is close enough to here to study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearest such planet might be only 12 light-years away. ''Such a star would be visible to the naked eye,'' Mr. Petigura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His result builds on a report earlier this year by David Charbonneau and Courtney Dressing of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, who found that about 15 percent of the smaller and more numerous stars known as red dwarfs have Earth-like planets in their habitable zones. Using slightly less conservative assumptions, Ravi Kopparapu of Pennsylvania State University found that half of all red dwarfs have such planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Galaxy contains billions of potentially habitable planets, say University of California at Berkeley and University of Hawaii at Manoa astronomers. Watch on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, who supervised Mr. Petigura's research and was a co-author of the paper along with Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii, said: ''This is the most important work I've ever been involved with. This is it. Are there inhabitable Earths out there?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm feeling a little tingly,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference Friday discussing the results, astronomers erupted in praise of the Kepler mission and its team. Natalie Batalha, a Kepler leader from the NASA Ames Research Center, described the project and its members as ''the best of humanity rising to the occasion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Petigura's new calculation, the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is 22 percent, plus or minus 8 percent, depending on exactly how you define the habitable zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several caveats. Although these planets are Earth-size, nobody knows what their masses are and thus whether they are rocky like the Earth, or balls of ice or gas, let alone whether anything can, or does -- or ever will -- live on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to believe, from recent observations of other worlds, however, that at least some Earth-size planets, if not all of them, are indeed rocky. Last week, two groups of astronomers announced that an Earth-size planet named Kepler 78b that orbits its sun in 8.5 hours has the same density as the Earth, though it is too hot to support life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nature,'' as Mr. Petigura put it, ''knows how to make rocky Earth-size planets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the number is more uncertain than it might have been because Kepler's pointing system failed before it could complete its prime survey. As a result, Mr. Petigura and his colleagues had to extrapolate from planets slightly larger than Earth and with slightly smaller, tighter orbits. For the purposes of his analysis ''Earth-size'' was anything from one to two times the diameter of the Earth, and Earth-like orbits were between 400 and 200 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Batalha said, ''We don't yet have any planet candidates that are exact analogues of the Earth in terms of size, orbit or star type.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Kepler itself is sidelined while astronomers devise a new program it can accomplish with less flexible pointing ability, it has sent back so much data that there is still a whole year's worth of results left to analyze, Dr. Batalha said. ''Scientists,'' she said, ''are going to work on Kepler data for decades.'' Kepler was launched in 2009 to perform a kind of cosmic census, monitoring the brightness of 150,000 far-off stars in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations, looking for dips in brightness when planets pass in front of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petigura and his colleagues restricted themselves to a subset of some 42,000 brighter and well-behaved stars. They found 603 planets, of which 10 were between one Earth and two Earths in diameter, and circled in what Mr. Petigura defined as the habitable zone, where they would receive between a quarter of the light the Earth gets, and four times as much. In the solar system, that zone would spread from inside the orbit of Venus to just outside the orbit of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in an innovation borrowed from other data-intensive fields like particle physics, Mr. Petigura designed a computer pipeline so that he could inject fake planets into the data -- 40,000 in all -- and see how efficiently his program could detect planets of different sizes and orbits. In addition to that correction, he and his colleagues had to correct for geometry; only about one in 100 planet systems is aligned edge-on so that earthlings would see the telltale wink of an exoplanet transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a ton of work,'' he recalled, explaining that he had to try out tens of billions of different periods for each star in order to find planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, an exoplanet astronomer at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not involved in the work, said the pipeline testing had made the results believable. ''I would say that small planets are everywhere and very common,'' she said, ''no matter how you slice and dice the data. But Kepler is dead and we have no way to get any further data. So we'll have to be satisfied with this as the final word, for now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Updated, 5:25 p.m. | After dodging questions for months about video evidence[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/toronto-police-chief-says-mayor-appears-in-video-uncovered-in-criminal-investigation/] said to show him using drugs, Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto stunned constituents and his own staff on Tuesday by telling a scrum of reporters, “Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Video of Mr. Ford’s admission[http://youtu.be/qQTwGO047E8], during an impromptu news conference[http://youtu.be/TODGDpPAjH8], showed him asking reporters to repeat the question they first raised in May, when journalists for Gawker[http://gawker.com/for-sale-a-video-of-toronto-mayor-rob-ford-smoking-cra-507736569] and The Toronto Star[http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/05/16/toronto_mayor_rob_ford_in_crack_cocaine_video_scandal.html] described seeing video that appeared to show the mayor using drugs. When one reporter complied, asking, “Do you smoke crack cocaine?” the mayor admitted that he had done so, but took issue with the way the question had been phrased. “Do I?” he said, “Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably, approximately a year ago. I answered your question. You ask the question properly, I’ll answer it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford then said: “there’s been times when I’ve been in a drunken stupor — that’s why I want to see the tape. I want everyone in the city to see this tape. I’d like to see this tape. I don’t even recall there being a tape or a video and I know that, so I want to see the state that I was in.” He added: “So I wasn’t lying. You didn’t ask the correct questions.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor confronted the news media shortly after his brother Doug, a close adviser who also serves on the City Council, had suggested that the city’s police chief, Bill Blair, should step aside for “bias” against Mr. Ford. Last week, the chief told reporters[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/toronto-police-chief-says-mayor-appears-in-video-uncovered-in-criminal-investigation/] that he was “disappointed” when he first viewed the video of the mayor seen by reporters in May.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of Mr. Ford’s admission on Tuesday, The Toronto Star drew attention to his firm denial of drug use[http://youtu.be/rguMxY8kqR4] in May, after the paper’s journalists revealed[http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/05/16/toronto_mayor_rob_ford_in_crack_cocaine_video_scandal.html] that they had been shown a clip of the mayor appearing to smoke crack by someone who wanted to sell the video.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India lofted a Mars-bound spacecraft into Earth orbit on Tuesday, a major step in its hopes to become the fourth country in the world and the first in Asia to reach Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch is only the first step, however, in an often-perilous, 300-day journey to Mars that has ended in failure for roughly a third of all previous efforts. Only the United States, Europe and Russia have successfully reached the Red Planet, and none of them managed it on their first try.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will use the effects of the earth’s gravity to propel it toward Mars. To achieve this it will have to orbit the Earth for a month as a series of small bursts by its thrusters slowly nudge it to the right trajectory. If all goes well, it will reach mars on Sept. 24, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a price tag of $72 million, the Mars project is relatively inexpensive, but that has not stopped critics from raising questions about why the government is pouring money into space programs when India has so many pressing social, educational and infrastructure needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prominent scholar and activist, Jean Dreze, told India Today[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mars-mission-indian-elites-delusional-quest-for-superpower-status/1/321731.html] that the Mars mission “seems to be part of the Indian elite’s delusional quest for superpower status.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those concerns were not widely shared by India’s leaders. In the heat of an election campaign, both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi, the candidate for prime minister from the main opposition Bhartiya Janata Party, were quick to congratulate the scientists on their initial success. “India has once again established itself in the world,” Mr. Modi said. “I congratulate the scientists and technicians behind the mission.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian officials also defended the program as yielding technological advances that are hard to predict in advance, claims that critics were quick to dismiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G. Madhavan Nair, the head of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research Organization</span> at the time of the moon launch, told The Indian Express[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mars-mission-useless-says-exisro-boss-nair/1146271/] earlier this year that “instead of concentrating on practical missions we are spending money to prove nothing. Someone has made some statement that the Mars mission will prove new technologies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “as a person familiar with these new technologies,” he said, “I believe that there is no new technology involved.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program is not only a source of nationalist pride but a weapon in India’s competition with China. It was shortly after the failure of a Chinese mission to Mars in 2011 that Mr. Singh, addressing the nation on India’s Independence Day, announced the plans for an Indian attempt, saying that “This spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India’s Mars venture was preceded by a similar mission that placed a spacecraft, Chandrayaan-I, in orbit around the moon in 2008. The moon mission also followed a similar effort by China, and officials were quite blunt about their intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“China has gone earlier, but today we are trying to catch them, catch that gap, bridge the gap,” Bhaskar Narayan, a director at the Indian space agency, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the spacecraft nears Mars it will be maneuvered into a low orbit to assay the Martian atmosphere, looking in particular for the presence of methane, a possible indicator of the existence of life processes at some point in the planet’s history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest size of the payload, at 33 pounds, is an indicator of the limitations of the mission. But repeated failures in the development of a rocket capable of carrying payloads of more than two tons had led to delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S.K. Das, a former member of the Space Commission, which sets out Indian space policy, said Tuesday that “we should see this as a technical exercise,” though he conceded that a more powerful rocket could have made for a less complex journey to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a long journey and we can only understand the challenges and the problems by attempting it,” he added. “The first stage has been flawless.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By DENNIS OVERBYE   </div><div>573 words</div><div>5 November 2013</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers reported Monday that there could be as many as 40 billion habitable earth-sized planets in the galaxy, based on a new analysis of data from <span class="companylink">NASA</span>’s Kepler spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One out of every five sun-like stars in the galaxy has a planet the size of earth circling it in the zone where surface temperatures should be compatible with liquid water, according to a herculean three-year calculation by Erik Petigura, a graduate student at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petigura’s analysis represents a major step toward the main goal of the Kepler mission: to measure what fraction of stars in the galaxy have earthlike planets. It is an important factor in estimating the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe. His paper was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It seems that the universe produces plentiful real estate for life that somehow resembles life on earth,’’ Mr. Petigura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 20 years, astronomers have logged more than 1,000 planets around other stars, and data from Kepler, in its four years of life before being derailed by a pointing malfunction last winter, provided 3,500 more candidatesfor such exoplanets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new result could steer plans to find a habitable planet that is close enough to study. The nearest such planet might be only 12 light years away. ‘‘Such a star would be visible to the naked eye,’’ Mr. Petigura said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He calculated the ratio of sun-like stars with habitable planets at 22 percent, plus or minus eight percentage points, depending on how the habitable zone is defined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result jibes with a report this year by David Charbonneau and Courtney Dressing of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, who found that about 15 percent of the smaller and more numerous stars known as red dwarfs have earthlike planets in their habitable zones. Astronomers estimate that there are at least 200 billion stars of all types in the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey Marcy of the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, who supervised Mr. Petigura’s research and was a co-author of the paper, along with Andrew Howard of the <span class="companylink">University of Hawaii</span>, said: ‘‘This is the most important work I’ve ever been involved with. This is it. Are there inhabitable earths out there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’m feeling a little tingly.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several caveats. Although these planets are earth-sized, nobody knows what their masses are and thus whether they are rocky like earth, or balls of ice or gas, let alone whether anything can or does or ever will live on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to believe, from recent observations of other worlds, however, that at least some earth-sized planets, if not all of them, are indeed rocky. Last week two groups of astronomers announced that Kepler 78b, an earth-sized planet that orbits its sun in eight and a half hours, has the same density as earth, although it is too hot to support life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As published in the International New York Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about a new calculation of the number of habitable Earth-size planets in the galaxy misstated part of the name of the journal in which the paper was published. It is Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> (not Science).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in February, shattering windows for miles and injuring well over 1,000 people, experts said it was a rare event -- of a magnitude that might occur only once every 100 to 200 years, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now a team of scientists is suggesting that the Earth is vulnerable to many more Chelyabinsk-size space rocks than was previously thought. In research being published Wednesday by the journal Nature, they estimate that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect ''really makes a lot of people uncomfortable,'' said Peter G. Brown, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Western Ontario and an author of the two studies in Nature. A third paper by other scientists describing the Chelyabinsk explosion was published online this week by the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings are helping to elevate the topic of planetary defense -- identifying dangerous asteroids and deflecting them if necessary -- from Hollywood fantasy to real-world concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A United Nations committee has been studying the issue for some time, and next month the General Assembly is expected to adopt two of its recommendations: establishing an International Asteroid Warning Network for countries to share information; and calling on the world's space agencies to set up an advisory group to explore technologies for deflecting an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sky surveys have spotted about 95 percent of the big near-Earth asteroids, those that are at least one kilometer wide, or 0.6 miles, and none are in danger of hitting Earth anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those are not the only ones to worry about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One kilometer is more than just dangerous,'' said Edward T. Lu, a former NASA space shuttle astronaut who heads the <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span>, a private effort to launch a space telescope that could find smaller asteroids. ''One kilometer is end-of-human-civilization kind of dangerous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelyabinsk asteroid was just 60 feet wide. Speeding around 40,000 miles per hour, it released energy equal to 500,000 tons of TNT. A larger asteroid, perhaps two or three times the diameter of the Chelyabinsk one, exploded over Siberia in 1908 and is estimated to have released energy equivalent to 5 million to 15 million tons of TNT, flattening millions of trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed B612 telescope, to be called Sentinel, is intended to find asteroids about 450 feet wide, although it will also find many that are smaller. Dr. Lu said the mission would cost $450 million -- $250 million to build the spacecraft and $200 million to operate it for a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 450-foot-wide asteroid, Dr. Lu said, would be equivalent to 150 million tons of TNT. ''You're not going to wipe out humanity,'' he said, ''but if you get unlucky, you could kill 50 million people or you could collapse the world economy for a century, two centuries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu said astronomers had found only 10 to 20 percent of the near-Earth asteroids of that size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sentinel would also spot many smaller ones that could still be devastating. ''What we've been talking about are the ones that would only destroy a major metropolitan area -- all of New York City and the surrounding area,'' Dr. Lu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said only about 0.5 percent of these smaller asteroids, roughly the size of the 1908 one, have been found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because telescope surveys have counted so few of the small asteroids, Dr. Brown and his colleagues instead investigated what has actually hit the Earth. In one of the articles in Nature, they examined <span class="companylink">United States Air Force</span> data from the 1960s and 1970s and later data from sensors verifying a ban on aboveground nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recordings captured the low-frequency atmospheric rumblings generated by about 60 asteroid explosions. Most came from small asteroids, but their data suggested that the somewhat larger ones hit more frequently than would be expected based on the estimates from sky surveys. That could mean the Earth has been unlucky recently, or that the estimates on the number of Chelyabinsk-size asteroids are too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any one of them individually I think you could dismiss,'' Dr. Brown said, ''but when you take it all together, I think the preponderance of the evidence is there is a much higher number of these tens-of-meters-size objects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu said that was one more reason to launch an asteroid-finding telescope. ''There are hints the rate is higher than we think, but we don't really know yet, and I think we should find out,'' he said. ''When you find out how many there are, you also find out where the individual ones are. Everything you discover you can either rule out as going to hit us or you say, 'Hey, we ought to look at this one more carefully.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the Chelyabinsk-size asteroids would elude detection by Sentinel. Still, the residents of Chelyabinsk would have benefited from a warning on the morning of Feb. 15 to stay away from the window. With a $5 million grant from NASA, University of Hawaii astronomers are setting up telescopes to scan the sky for quick-moving spots of light that could be oncoming asteroids. There would be no opportunity to deflect the asteroid that would hit in days or weeks, but it would give time to warn, and to evacuate. That system is scheduled to go into operation in 2015.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>760 words</div><div>7 November 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European satellite that mapped Earth's gravitational field in exquisite detail will be pulled down by gravity to its fiery destruction sometime in the next few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where and when it will crash no one knows. It could be almost anywhere on the globe. About 25 to 45 fragments of the one-ton spacecraft are expected to survive all the way to the surface, with the largest perhaps weighing 200 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest in a parade of spacecraft falling from the sky in what are worryingly called ''uncontrolled entries.'' About 100 tons of debris will fall from the sky this year alone. There are, however, no known instances in which anyone has been injured by space debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's rather hard to predict where the spacecraft will re-enter and impact,'' said Rune Floberghagen, the mission manager for the European Space Agency's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE. ''Concretely our best engineering prediction is now for a re-entry on Sunday, with a possibility for it slipping into early Monday.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOCE (pronounced GO-chay) ran out of propellant last month and has been dropping about 2.5 miles a day. As of Wednesday, it was still 113 miles up as it circled the Earth once every 88 minutes. Its orbit goes almost directly over the poles, and as the planet rotates, almost all places on Earth pass beneath it at some point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, NASA's decommissioned Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, tumbling out of control, worried people around the world until it splashed harmlessly in the Pacific. Later that year, the Russian spacecraft Phobos-Grunt launched into orbit, but then malfunctioned. Instead of heading toward Mars, it crashed back to Earth a couple of months later, again falling in the Pacific without incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances that a chunk of GOCE or any other space debris will injure anyone are tiny, but not zero. Dr. Floberghagen said the debris will endanger about 15 to 20 square yards of the Earth's surface. ''If you compare that to the surface of the planet, it's a very small number,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An uncontrolled re-entry was always the planned fate for GOCE, which was launched in March 2009. Unlike most spacecraft, which use thrusters to adjust their orbits, it has a highly efficient propulsion system called an ion engine. Unlike thrusters, the engine can fire continuously to offset atmospheric drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That allowed GOCE, with its sleek, airplanelike shape, to maintain a low orbit, just 160 miles up and later 140 miles. From that perch, it made gravity measurements that were much more accurate and detailed than previous ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can actually map, see geology, in the gravity map,'' Dr. Floberghagen said. ''This is something that is quite unique, actually.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, by combining GOCE's gravity measurements of the surfaces of oceans with altitude measurements from other spacecraft, scientists have created global maps of ocean currents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data will also help scientists study ice sheets and convection in the Earth's mantle, and help oil companies figure out where to drill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the ion engine was able to keep the spacecraft aloft, its thrust was far too weak -- ''More or less equal to what you normally exert on a piece of paper when you exhale,'' Dr. Floberghagen said -- to push the spacecraft to a trajectory that would assure it of ending up in an empty stretch of ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its propellant tank empty, it is now guided by gravity and air friction. ''Quite literally GOCE is now nearly flying like an airplane without an engine, with the upper layer of the atmosphere providing aerodynamic stabilization,'' Dr. Floberghagen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it descends into thicker air, the atmospheric drag will increase sharply, and its fall is expected to accelerate in a final plunge sometime between Saturday and Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day before re-entry, mission managers will be able to narrow the time of the crash within three orbits, Dr. Floberghagen said. GOCE's instruments continue to operate, providing scientists with detailed data about its final plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the United Nations adopted guidelines to reduce the dangers caused by space debris. By then, GOCE had already been designed, but a future mission like it might have additional thrusters for a safer ending.</p>
<p>The Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE, is expected to fall sometime in the next few days. (PHOTOGRAPH BY EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY)   </p>
